## Welcome to ICS 438, Fall 2023


The course introduces students to analytics principles in big data with an emphasis on natural language processing and text analysis. The course syllabus can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q_o8-Lsown96PpbDHTh9dLxA9T0Gl_j1pISgJYJXuzE).

#### Overview


Data collection and generation have become more efficient and
cost-effective. Consider that an individual in a high-income country
produces roughly megabytes of data every second. Yet, in the face of
such technological progress, we find ourselves overwhelmed with
information yet starved for knowledge. A significant reason for this
dilemma may be the shortage of data-proficient professionals capable
of extracting meaningful insights, whether scientific, economic, or
social, from this abundance of data.

In the realm of data analytics, one encounters a spectrum of
challenges, from the initial stages of data ingestion and management
to the nuanced areas of analysis, representation, and articulation. In
this course, we will delve into core big data principles, paying
particular attention to textual data. Our primary aim is to acquaint
you with hands-on methods and instrumental tools to efficiently
handle, scrutinize, and illustrate extensive datasets.



### Course Objectives
1. Understand the various platforms, formats, and specifications related to big data.
2. Acquire knowledge of essential algorithms and methodologies to navigate big data and derive actionable intelligence.
3. Become acquainted with machine learning and contemporary AI-driven models tailored for extracting valuable insights from textual data.
