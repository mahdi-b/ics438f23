# E04: Introduction to Javascript with FreeCodeCamp

In this experience, you will start getting familiar with the syntax of Javascript by practicing the creation of simple Javascript code using FreeCodeCamp.

First, sign up for an account on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Second, start doing the 110 exercises in "Basic Javascript" (that's the first subsection inside "Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification" section. They say it takes 10 hours, I think you can do it more quickly, but it will be several hours of work.  Don't be turned off by the "simplicity"---the goal here is to get you typing Javascript and try to get your fingers to understand the language.  When you are done, you should have checked off all of the Basic Javascript curriculum, here's what the first part should look like:

Now move on and complete the 31 exercises in the "ES6" curriculum. Here's what the first part should look like when you've completed all 31 exercises:

{% include medium-img.html url="experience-interactive-javascript-2.png" %}

Phew! That was a lot of work but you've now got a pretty decent introduction to Javascript under your belt!

## Submission instructions

Please complete the Introduction to Javascript and ES6 sections by the date and time indicated on the Schedule page. I will verify in class that you have completed the course by asking you to display your [FreeCodeCamp learn page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/). All 106 Basic Javascript exercises and all 26 ES6 exercises must be completed.
