# E06: Reflect on Javascript 1

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If you're a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

# GitHub Gist Example

Here's an example GitHub gist:

## MathJax Example

This section demonstrates the use of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) for rendering mathematical notation in markdown files.

For example, the following markdoswn:

```
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```

when rendered, produces the following text:

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

You can also create a block of math using the `\\[` delimiter. For example, the following markdown:

```
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
```

Produces the following block:

\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]
