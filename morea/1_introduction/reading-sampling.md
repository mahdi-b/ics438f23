### Data Sampling to the Rescue

While large datasets can provide rich insights, processing requires computational resources and time. What if there was a way to extract meaningful insights without processing the entire dataset every time? This is the promise of sampling data.

Data sampling allows us to work with a manageable subset of the data, without compromising the quality of insights. Meanwhile, appropriate data representation ensures that we capture the essence of the data in more manageable formats. 

This notebook delves into some simple sampling techniques. Specifically, the notebook covers:
The foundational principles of sampling and why it's crucial. 

Different strategies for sampling, ensuring we capture the essence of the complete dataset. 

The challenges and nuances of working with time series data.
