    "Common Strategies for Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Subsampling: Here, you pick every k-th record from the time series data. For example, if k=5, you'd select every 5th data point. This strategy is simple but can risk missing out on important variations in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bucket-Based Sampling: This method involves dividing the time series data into discrete sections or \"buckets\" based on a time unit like an hour or a day. You then select an equal number of samples from each bucket. This approach ensures that the sample is evenly distributed across the time range of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Adaptive Sampling: This technique adjusts the sampling rate based on the variability or importance of the data points. For example, if the time series shows rapid changes, the sampling rate increases, and it decreases during periods of little to no change.\n"
