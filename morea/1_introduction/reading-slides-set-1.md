### Week 1 Session 1

For Week 1, our slides will lay the groundwork for the entire course. We'll kick off by diving into the course logistics to ensure everyone's on the same page regarding schedules, expectations, and other essential details. Following that, we'll venture into an introductory exploration of big data, analytics, and data science. These concepts form the core of our course. As we progress through the course, we'll be introduced to manay new tools. That said, Python stands out as the cornerstone. Given its significance, we'll also touch on Python in these initial slides.
