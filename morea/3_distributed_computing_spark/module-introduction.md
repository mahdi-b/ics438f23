This module provides a brief introduction to the MapReduce
paradigm and concentrate on Apache Spark, a widely-used distributed
system based on the MapReduce framework for managing large volumes of
data. The module delves into the primary components of Spark,
exploring how data storage and optimization are achieved. It also
highlights functions for loading, exploring, manipulating, and joining
data within the Spark environment.
