Over

Queen
O
speak
to
me
no
more
These
words
like
daggers
enter
in
mine
ears
No
more
sweet
Hamlet
Ham
A
murtherer
and
a
villain
A
slave
that
is
not
twentieth
part
the
tithe
Of
your
precedent
lord
a
vice
of
kings
A
cutpurse
of
the
empire
and
the
rule
That
from
a
shelf
the
precious
diadem
stole
And
put
it
in
his
pocket
Queen
No
more
Enter
the
Ghost
in
his
nightgown
Ham
A
king
of
shreds
and
patches
Save
me
and
hover
o
er
me
with
your
wings
You
heavenly
guards
What
would
your
gracious
figure
Queen
Alas
he
s
mad
Ham
Do
you
not
come
your
tardy
son
to
chide
That
laps
d
in
time
and
passion
lets
go
by
Th
important
acting
of
your
dread
command
O
say
Ghost
Do
not
forget
This
visitation
Is
but
to
whet
thy
almost
blunted
purpose
But
look
amazement
on
thy
mother
sits
O
step
between
her
and
her
fighting
soul
Conceit
in
weakest
bodies
strongest
works
Speak
to
her
Hamlet
Ham
How
is
it
with
you
lady
Queen
Alas
how
is
t
with
you
That
you
do
bend
your
eye
on
vacancy
And
with
th
encorporal
air
do
hold
discourse
Forth
at
your
eyes
your
spirits
wildly
peep
And
as
the
sleeping
soldiers
in
th
alarm
Your
bedded
hairs
like
life
in
excrements
Start
up
and
stand
an
end
O
gentle
son
Upon
the
beat
and
flame
of
thy
distemper
Sprinkle
cool
patience
Whereon
do
you
look
Ham
On
him
on
him
Look
you
how
pale
he
glares
His
form
and
cause
conjoin
d
preaching
to
stones
Would
make
them
capable
Do
not
look
upon
me
Lest
with
this
piteous
action
you
convert
My
stern
effects
Then
what
I
have
to
do
Will
want
true
colour
tears
perchance
for
blood
Queen
To
whom
do
you
speak
this
Ham
Do
you
see
nothing
there
Queen
Nothing
at
all
yet
all
that
is
I
see
Ham
Nor
did
you
nothing
hear
Queen
No
nothing
but
ourselves
Ham
Why
look
you
there
Look
how
it
steals
away
My
father
in
his
habit
as
he
liv
d
Look
where
he
goes
even
now
out
at
the
portal
Exit
Ghost
Queen
This
is
the
very
coinage
of
your
brain
This
bodiless
creation
ecstasy
Is
very
cunning
in
Ham
Ecstasy
My
pulse
as
yours
doth
temperately
keep
time
And
makes
as
healthful
music
It
is
not
madness
That
I
have
utt
red
Bring
me
to
the
test
And
I
the
matter
will
reword
which
madness
Would
gambol
from
Mother
for
love
of
grace
Lay
not
that
flattering
unction
to
your
soul
That
not
your
trespass
but
my
madness
speaks
It
will
but
skin
and
film
the
ulcerous
place
Whiles
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
Infects
unseen
Confess
yourself
to
heaven
Repent
what
s
past
avoid
what
is
to
come
And
do
not
spread
the
compost
on
the
weeds
To
make
them
ranker
Forgive
me
this
my
virtue
For
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
Virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
Yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
Queen
O
Hamlet
thou
hast
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
Ham
O
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
And
live
the
purer
with
the
other
half
Good
night
but
go
not
to
my
uncle
s
bed
Assume
a
virtue
if
you
have
it
not
That
monster
custom
who
all
sense
doth
eat
Of
habits
evil
is
angel
yet
in
this
That
to
the
use
of
actions
fair
and
good
He
likewise
gives
a
frock
or
livery
That
aptly
is
put
on
Refrain
to
night
And
that
shall
lend
a
kind
of
easiness
To
the
next
abstinence
the
next
more
easy
For
use
almost
can
change
the
stamp
of
nature
And
either
master
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
With
wondrous
potency
Once
more
good
night
And
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
blest
I
ll
blessing
beg
of
you
For
this
same
lord
I
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleas
d
it
so
To
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
That
I
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
I
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
The
death
I
gave
him
So
again
good
night
I
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
Thus
bad
begins
and
worse
remains
behind
One
word
more
good
lady
Queen
What
shall
I
do
Ham
Not
this
by
no
means
that
I
bid
you
do
Let
the
bloat
King
tempt
you
again
to
bed
Pinch
wanton
on
your
cheek
call
you
his
mouse
And
let
him
for
a
pair
of
reechy
kisses
Or
paddling
in
your
neck
with
his
damn
d
fingers
Make
you
to
ravel
all
this
matter
out
That
I
essentially
am
not
in
madness
But
mad
in
craft
Twere
good
you
let
him
know
For
who
that
s
but
a
queen
fair
sober
wise
Would
from
a
paddock
from
a
bat
a
gib
Such
dear
concernings
hide
Who
would
do
so
No
in
despite
of
sense
and
secrecy
Unpeg
the
basket
on
the
house
s
top
Let
the
birds
fly
and
like
the
famous
ape
To
try
conclusions
in
the
basket
creep
And
break
your
own
neck
down
Queen
Be
thou
assur
d
if
words
be
made
of

And
breath
of
life
I
have
no
life
to
breathe
What

Ham
I

There

They

For

the
sport
to

Hoist

But
I

O

In

Behind

Whips

rapier
cries
A

apprehension
kills
The

O

But
so
much
was

love
We
would
not
understand
what
was
most
fit
But
like
the
owner
of
a
foul
disease
To
keep
it
from
divulging
let

Even

the
pith
of
life
Where

gone

To

Scene
V
Elsinore
A
room
in
the
Castle
Enter
Horatio
Queen
and
a
Gentleman
Queen
I
will
not
speak
with
her
Gent
She
is
importunate
indeed
distract
Her
mood
will
needs
be
pitied
Queen
What
would
she
have
Gent
She
speaks
much
of
her
father
says
she
hears
There
s
tricks
i
th
world
and
hems
and
beats
her
heart
Spurns
enviously
at
straws
speaks
things
in
doubt
That
carry
but
half
sense
Her
speech
is
nothing
Yet
the
unshaped
use
of
it
doth
move
The
hearers
to
collection
they
aim
at
it
And
botch
the
words
up
fit
to
their
own
thoughts
Which
as
her
winks
and
nods
and
gestures
yield
them
Indeed
would
make
one
think
there
might
be
thought
Though
nothing
sure
yet
much
unhappily
Hor
Twere
good
she
were
spoken
with
for
she
may
strew
Dangerous
conjectures
in
ill
breeding
minds
Queen
Let
her
come
in
Exit
Gentleman
Aside
To
my
sick
soul
as
sin
s
true
nature
is
Each
toy
seems
Prologue
to
some
great
amiss
So
full
of
artless
jealousy
is
guilt
It
spills
itself
in
fearing
to
be
spilt
Enter
Ophelia
distracted
Oph
Where
is
the
beauteous
Majesty
of
Denmark
Queen
How
now
Ophelia
Oph
sings
How
should
I
your
true
love
know
From
another
one
By
his
cockle
bat
and
staff
And
his
sandal
shoon
Queen
Alas
sweet
lady

this
song

Say

Nay

You

He
is

He
is
dead
and
gone
At
his
head

turf
At
his
heels

stone
O

Nay
but

Pray

Which

not
go
With
true

How

I
hope

We

I

My

Feeds
