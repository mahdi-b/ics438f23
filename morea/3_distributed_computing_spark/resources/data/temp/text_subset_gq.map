PRINCE
I
do
not
like
the
Tower
of
any
place
Did
Julius
Caesar
build
that
place
my
lord
BUCKINGHAM
He
did
my
gracious
lord
begin
that
place
Which
since
succeeding
ages
have
re
edified
PRINCE
Is
it
upon
record
or
else
reported
Successively
from
age
to
age
he
built
it
BUCKINGHAM
Upon
record
my
gracious
lord
PRINCE
But
say
my
lord
it
were
not
regist
red
Methinks
the
truth
should
Eve
from
age
to
age
As
twere
retail
d
to
all
posterity
Even
to
the
general
all
ending
day
GLOUCESTER
Aside
So
wise
so
young
they
say
do
never
live
long
PRINCE
What
say
you
uncle
GLOUCESTER
I
say
without
characters
fame
lives
long
Aside
Thus
like
the
formal
vice
Iniquity
I
moralize
two
meanings
in
one
word
PRINCE
That
Julius
Caesar
was
a
famous
man
With
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit
His
wit
set
down
to
make
his
valour
live
Death
makes
no
conquest
of
this
conqueror
For
now
he
lives
in
fame
though
not
in
life
I
ll
tell
you
what
my
cousin
Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM
What
my
gracious
lord
PRINCE
An
if
I
live
until
I
be
a
man
I
ll
win
our
ancient
right
in
France
again
Or
die
a
soldier
as
I
liv
d
a
king
GLOUCESTER
Aside
Short
summers
lightly
have
a
forward
spring
Enter
HASTINGS
young
YORK
and
the
CARDINAL
BUCKINGHAM
Now
in
good
time
here
comes
the
Duke
of
York
PRINCE
Richard
of
York
how
fares
our
loving
brother
YORK
Well
my
dread
lord
so
must
I
can
you
now
PRINCE
Ay
brother
to
our
grief
as
it
is
yours
Too
late
he
died
that
might
have
kept
that
title
Which
by
his
death
hath
lost
much
majesty
GLOUCESTER
How
fares
our
cousin
noble
Lord
of
York
YORK
I
thank
you
gentle
uncle
O
my
lord
You
said
that
idle
weeds
are
fast
in
growth
The
Prince
my
brother
hath
outgrown
me
far
GLOUCESTER
He
hath
my
lord
YORK
And
therefore
is
he
idle
GLOUCESTER
O
my
fair
cousin
I
must
not
say
so
YORK
Then
he
is
more
beholding
to
you
than
I
GLOUCESTER
He
may
command
me
as
my
sovereign
But
you
have
power
in
me
as
in
a
kinsman
YORK
I
pray
you
uncle
give
me
this
dagger
GLOUCESTER
My
dagger
little
cousin
With
all
my
heart
PRINCE
A
beggar
brother
YORK
Of
my
kind
uncle
that
I
know
will
give
And
being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to
give
GLOUCESTER
A
greater
gift
than
that
I
ll
give
my
cousin
YORK
A
greater
gift
O
that
s
the
sword
to
it
GLOUCESTER
Ay
gentle
cousin
were
it
light
enough
YORK
O
then
I
see
you
will
part
but
with
light
gifts
In
weightier
things
you
ll
say
a
beggar
nay
GLOUCESTER
It
is
too
heavy
for
your
Grace
to
wear
YORK
I
weigh
it
lightly
were
it
heavier
GLOUCESTER
What
would
you
have
my
weapon
little
Lord
YORK
I
would
that
I
might
thank
you
as
you
call
me
GLOUCESTER
How
YORK
Little
PRINCE
My
Lord
of
York
will
still
be
cross
in
talk
Uncle
your
Grace
knows
how
to
bear
with
him
YORK
You
mean
to
bear
me
not
to
bear
with
me
Uncle
my
brother
mocks
both
you
and
me
Because
that
I
am
little
like
an
ape
He
thinks
that
you
should
bear
me
on
your
shoulders
BUCKINGHAM
With
what
a
sharp
provided
wit
he
reasons
To
mitigate
the
scorn
he
gives
his
uncle
He
prettily
and
aptly
taunts
himself
So
cunning
and
so
young
is
wonderful
GLOUCESTER
My
lord
will
t
please
you
pass
along
Myself
and
my
good
cousin
Buckingham
Will
to
your
mother
to
entreat
of
her
To
meet
you
at
the
Tower
and
welcome
you
YORK
What
will
you
go
unto
the
Tower
my
lord
PRINCE
My
Lord
Protector
needs
will
have
it
so
YORK
I
shall
not
sleep
in
quiet
at
the
Tower
GLOUCESTER
Why
what
should
you
fear
YORK
Marry
my
uncle
Clarence
angry
ghost
My
grandam
told
me
he
was
murder
d
there
PRINCE
I
fear
no
uncles
dead
GLOUCESTER
Nor
none
that
live
I
hope
PRINCE
An
if
they
live
I
hope
I
need
not
fear
But
come
my
lord
and
with
a
heavy
heart
Thinking
on
them
go

the
Tower
A

Exeunt

GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM

CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM
Think
you
my
lord
this
little
prating
York
Was
not
incensed
by
his
subtle
mother
To
taunt
and
scorn
you
thus
opprobriously
GLOUCESTER
No
doubt

O
tis
a
perilous
boy
Bold
quick
ingenious

He
is
all

Well

As

In

How

him
tractable
to

Encourage

If

Be

Enter
a
MESSENGER
to

of
HASTINGS
MESSENGER
My

my

Knocking
HASTINGS

Who
knocks
MESSENGER
One
from
the
Lord
Stanley
HASTINGS
Within
What
is
t
o
clock
MESSENGER
Upon
the
stroke
of
four
Enter
LORD
HASTINGS
HASTINGS
Cannot
my
Lord
Stanley
sleep
these
tedious
nights
MESSENGER
So
it
appears
by
that
I
have
to
say
First
he
commends
him
to
your
noble
self
HASTINGS
What
then
MESSENGER
Then
certifies
your
lordship
that
this
night
He
dreamt
the
boar
had
razed
off
his
helm
Besides
he
says
there
are
two
councils
kept
And
that
may
be
determin
d
at
the
one
Which
may
make
you
and
him
to
rue
at
th
other
Therefore
he
sends
to
know
your
lordship
s
pleasure
If
you
will
presently
take
horse
with
him
And
with
all
speed
post
with
him
toward
the
north
To
shun
the
danger
that
his
soul
divines
HASTINGS
Go
fellow
go
return
unto
thy
lord
Bid
him
not
fear
the
separated
council
His
honour
and
myself
are
at
the
one
And
at
the
other
is
my
good
friend
Catesby
Where
nothing
can
proceed
that
toucheth
us
Whereof
I
shall
not
have
intelligence
Tell
him
his
fears
are
shallow
without
instance
And
for
his
dreams
I
wonder
he
s
so
simple
To
trust
the
mock
ry
of
unquiet
slumbers
To
fly
the
boar
before
the
boar
pursues
Were
to
incense
the
boar
to
follow
us
And
make
pursuit
where
he
did
mean
no
chase
Go
bid
thy
master
rise
and
come
to
me
And
we
will
both
together
to
the
Tower
Where
he
shall
see
the
boar
will
use
us
kindly

what
you

Exit

CATESBY
CATESBY
Many
good

my

HASTINGS
Good
morrow
Catesby
you
are
early
stirring
What
news
what
news
in
this
our
tott
ring
state
CATESBY
It
is
a
reeling
world
indeed
my
lord
And
I
believe
will
never
stand
upright
Till
Richard
wear
the
garland
of
the
realm
HASTINGS
How
wear
the
garland
Dost
thou
mean
the
crown
CATESBY
Ay
my
good
lord
HASTINGS
I
ll
have
this
crown
of
mine
cut
from
my
shoulders
Before
I
ll
see
the
crown
so
foul
misplac
d
But
canst
thou
guess
that
he
doth
aim
at
it
CATESBY
Ay
on
my
life
and
hopes
to
find
you
forward
Upon
his
party
for
the
gain
thereof
And
thereupon
he
sends
you
this
good
news
That
this
same
very
day
your
enemies
The
kindred
of
the
Queen
must
die
at
Pomfret
HASTINGS
Indeed
I
am
no
mourner
for
that
news
Because
they
have
been
still
my
adversaries
But
that
I
ll
give
my
voice
on
Richard
s
side
To
bar
my
master
s
heirs
in
true
descent
God
knows
I
will
not
do
it
to
the
death
CATESBY
God
keep
your
lordship
in
that
gracious
mind
HASTINGS
But
I
shall
laugh
at
this
a
twelve
month
hence
That
they
which
brought
me
in
my
master
s
hate
I
live
to
look
upon
their
tragedy
Well
Catesby
ere
a
fortnight
make
me
older
I
ll
send
some
packing
that
yet
think
not

Tis
a
vile
thing
to
die
my
gracious
lord
When

are
unprepar

look
not

it
HASTINGS
O
monstrous
monstrous
And
so
falls
it
out
With
Rivers

With

as
safe
As
thou

knowest
are

To

Lord
Hastings
you
and
he
are
near
in
love
HASTINGS
I
thank
his
Grace
I
know
he
loves
me
well
But
for
his
purpose
in
the
coronation
I
have
not
sounded
him
nor
he
deliver
d
His
gracious
pleasure
any
way
therein
But
you
my
honourable
lords
may
name
the
time
And
in
the
Duke
s
behalf
I
ll
give
my
voice
Which
I
presume
he
ll
take
in
gentle
part
Enter
GLOUCESTER
BISHOP
OF
ELY
In
happy
time
here
comes
the
Duke
himself
GLOUCESTER
My
noble
lords
and
cousins
an
good
morrow
I
have
been
long
a
sleeper
but
I
trust
My
absence
doth
neglect
no
great
design
Which
by
my
presence
might
have
been
concluded
BUCKINGHAM
Had
you
not
come
upon
your
cue
my
lord
WILLIAM
Lord
Hastings
had
pronounc
d
your
part
I
mean
your
voice
for
crowning
of
the
King
GLOUCESTER
Than
my
Lord
Hastings
no
man
might
be
bolder
His
lordship
knows
me
well
and
loves
me
well
My
lord
of
Ely
when
I
was
last
in
Holborn
I
saw
good
strawberries
in
your
garden
there
I
do
beseech
you
send
for
some
of
them
BISHOP
of
ELY
Marry
and
will

lord
with
all
my
heart
Exit
GLOUCESTER
Cousin
of
Buckingham
a
word
with
you
Takes
him
aside
Catesby
hath
sounded
Hastings
in
our
business
And
finds
the
testy
gentleman
so
hot
That
he
will
lose
his
head
ere
give
consent
His
master
s
child
as
worshipfully
he
terms
it
Shall
lose
the
royalty
of
England
s
throne
BUCKINGHAM
Withdraw
yourself
awhile
I
ll
go
with
you
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER
and
BUCKINGHAM
DERBY
We
have
not
yet
set
down
this
day
of
triumph
To
morrow
in
my
judgment
is
too
sudden
For
I
myself
am
not
so
well
provided
As
else
I
would
be
were
the
day
prolong
d
Re
enter
the
BISHOP
OF
ELY
BISHOP
OF
ELY
Where
is
my
lord
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
I
have
sent
for
these
strawberries
HASTINGS
His
Grace
looks
cheerfully
and
smooth
this
morning
There
s
some
conceit
or
other
likes
him
well
When
that
he
bids
good
morrow
with
such
spirit
I
think
there
s
never
a
man
in
Christendom
Can
lesser
hide
his
love
or
hate
than
he
For
by
his
face
straight
shall
you
know
his
heart
DERBY
What
of
his
heart
perceive
you
in
his
face
By
any
livelihood
he
show
d
to
day
HASTINGS
Marry
that
with
no
man
here
he
is
offended
For
were
he
he
had
shown
it
in
his
looks
Re
enter
GLOUCESTER
and
BUCKINGHAM
GLOUCESTER
I
pray
you
all
tell
me
what
they
deserve
That
do
conspire
my
death
with
devilish
plots
Of
damned
witchcraft
and
that
have
prevail
d
Upon
my
body
with
their
hellish
charms
HASTINGS
The
tender
love
I
bear
your
Grace
my
lord
Makes
me
most
forward
in
this
princely
presence
To
doom
th
offenders
whosoe
er
they
be
I
say
my
lord
they
have
deserved
death
GLOUCESTER
Then
be
your
eyes
the
witness
of
their
evil
Look
how
I
am
bewitch
d
behold
mine
arm
Is
like
a
blasted
sapling
wither
d
up
And
this
is
Edward
s
wife
that
monstrous
witch
Consorted
with
that
harlot
strumpet
Shore
That
by
their
witchcraft
thus
have
marked
me
HASTINGS
If
they
have
done
this
deed
my
noble
lord
GLOUCESTER
If
thou
protector
of
this
damned
strumpet
Talk
st
thou
to
me
of
ifs
Thou
art
a
traitor
Off
with
his
head
Now
by
Saint
Paul
I
swear
I
will
not
dine
until
I
see
the
same
Lovel
and
Ratcliff
look
that
it
be
done
The
rest
that
love
me
rise
and
follow
me
Exeunt
all
but
HASTINGS
LOVEL
and
RATCLIFF
HASTINGS
Woe
woe
for
England
not
a
whit
for
me
For
I
too
fond
might
have
prevented
this
STANLEY
did
dream
the
boar
did
raze
our
helms
And
I
did
scorn
it
and
disdain
to
fly
Three
times
to
day
my
foot
cloth
horse
did
stumble
And
started
when
he
look
d
upon
the
Tower
As
loath
to
bear
me
to
the
slaughter
house
O
now
I
need
the
priest
that
spake
to
me
I
now
repent
I
told
the
pursuivant
As
too
triumphing
how
mine
enemies
To
day
at
Pomfret
bloodily
were
butcher
d
And
I
myself
secure
in
grace
and
favour
O
Margaret
Margaret
now
thy
heavy
curse
Is
lighted
on
poor
Hastings
wretched
head
RATCLIFF
Come
come
dispatch
the
Duke
would
be
at
dinner
Make
a
short
shrift
he
longs
to
see
your
head
HASTINGS
O
momentary
grace
of
mortal
men
Which
we
more
hunt
for
than
the
grace
of
God
Who
builds
his
hope
in
air
of
your
good
looks
Lives
like
a
drunken
sailor
on
a
mast
Ready
with
every
nod
to
tumble
down
Into
the
fatal
bowels
of
the
deep
LOVEL
Come
come
dispatch
tis
bootless
to
exclaim
HASTINGS
O
bloody
Richard
Miserable
England
I
prophesy
the
fearfull
st
time
to
thee
That
ever
wretched
age
hath

shortly
shall

London
The

Enter
GLOUCESTER
and
BUCKINGHAM
in
rotten
armour
marvellous
ill
favoured
GLOUCESTER
Come
cousin
canst
thou
quake
and
change
thy
colour
Murder
thy
breath
in
middle
of
a
word
And
then
again
begin
and
stop
again
As
if
thou
were
distraught
and
mad
with
terror
BUCKINGHAM
Tut
I
can
counterfeit
the
deep
tragedian
Speak
and
look
back
and
pry
on
every
side
Tremble
and
start
at
wagging
of
a
straw
Intending
deep
suspicion
Ghastly
looks
Are
at
my
service
like
enforced
smiles
And
both
are
ready
in
their
offices
At
any
time
to
grace
my
stratagems
But

Catesby

of
that
ignoble
traitor
The
dangerous
and
unsuspected
Hastings
GLOUCESTER
So
dear
I
lov

the
man
that
I
must
weep
I
took
him
for
the
plainest
harmless
creature
That
breath

upon
the
earth
a
Christian
Made
him
my
book
wherein
my
soul
recorded
The
history
of
all
her
secret
thoughts
So
smooth
he
daub
d
his
vice
with
show
of
virtue
That
his
apparent
open
guilt
omitted
I
mean
his
conversation
with
Shore

Would
you

almost
believe
Were

great
preservation
We

to
tell
it

This
day

plotted

my
good

Had

done
so
GLOUCESTER
What
think
you

Turks
or
Infidels
Or
that
we
would
against

form
of
law
Proceed
thus
rashly
