CAMILLO
O
my
lord
I
would
your
spirit
were
easier
for
advice
Or
stronger
for
your
need
FLORIZEL
Hark
Perdita
Takes
her
aside
To
CAMILLO
I
ll
hear
you
by
and
by
CAMILLO
He
s
irremovable
Resolv
d
for
flight
Now
were
I
happy
if
His
going
I
could
frame
to
serve
my
turn
Save
him
from
danger
do
him
love
and
honour
Purchase
the
sight
again
of
dear
Sicilia
And
that
unhappy
king
my
master
whom
I
so
much
thirst
to
see
FLORIZEL
Now
good
Camillo
I
am
so
fraught
with
curious
business
that
I
leave
out
ceremony
CAMILLO
Sir
I
think
You
have
heard
of
my
poor
services
i
th
love
That
I
have
borne
your
father
FLORIZEL
Very
nobly
Have
you
deserv
d
It
is
my
father
s
music
To
speak
your
deeds
not
little
of
his
care
To
have
them
recompens
d
as
thought
on
CAMILLO
Well
my
lord
If
you
may
please
to
think
I
love
the
King
And
through
him
what
s
nearest
to
him
which
is
Your
gracious
self
embrace
but
my
direction
If
your
more
ponderous
and
settled
project
May
suffer
alteration
on
mine
honour
I
ll
point
you
where
you
shall
have
such
receiving
As
shall
become
your
Highness
where
you
may
Enjoy
your
mistress
from
the
whom
I
see
There
s
no
disjunction
to
be
made
but
by
As
heavens
forfend
your
ruin
marry
her
And
with
my
best
endeavours
in
your
absence
Your
discontenting
father
strive
to
qualify
And
bring
him
up
to
liking
FLORIZEL
How
Camillo
May
this
almost
a
miracle
be
done
That
I
may
call
thee
something
more
than
man
And
after
that
trust
to
thee
CAMILLO
Have
you
thought
on
A
place
whereto
you
ll
go
FLORIZEL
Not
any
yet
But
as
th
unthought
on
accident
is
guilty
To
what
we
wildly
do
so
we
profess
Ourselves
to
be
the
slaves
of
chance
and
flies
Of
every
wind
that
blows
CAMILLO
Then
list
to
me
This
follows
if
you
will
not
change
your
purpose
But
undergo
this
flight
make
for
Sicilia
And
there
present
yourself
and
your
fair
princess
For
so
I
see
she
must
be
fore
Leontes
She
shall
be
habited
as
it
becomes
The
partner
of
your
bed
Methinks
I
see
Leontes
opening
his
free
arms
and
weeping
His
welcomes
forth
asks
thee
there
Son
forgiveness
As
twere
i
th
father
s
person
kisses
the
hands
Of
your
fresh
princess
o
er
and
o
er
divides
him
Twixt
his
unkindness
and
his
kindness
th
one
He
chides
to
hell
and
bids
the
other
grow
Faster
than
thought
or
time
FLORIZEL
Worthy
Camillo
What
colour
for
my
visitation
shall
I
Hold
up
before
him
CAMILLO
Sent
by
the
King
your
father
To
greet
him
and
to
give
him
comforts
Sir
The
manner
of
your
bearing
towards
him
with
What
you
as
from
your
father
shall
deliver
Things
known
betwixt
us
three
I
ll
write
you
down
The
which
shall
point
you
forth
at
every
sitting
What
you
must
say
that
he
shall
not
perceive
But
that
you
have
your
father
s
bosom
there
And
speak
his
very
heart
FLORIZEL
I
am
bound
to
you
There
is
some
sap
in
this
CAMILLO
A
course
more
promising
Than
a
wild
dedication
of
yourselves
To
unpath
d
waters
undream
d
shores
most
certain
To
miseries
enough
no
hope
to
help
you
But
as
you
shake
off
one
to
take
another
Nothing
so
certain
as
your
anchors
who
Do
their
best
office
if
they
can
but
stay
you
Where
you
ll
be
loath
to
be
Besides
you
know
Prosperity
s
the
very
bond
of
love
Whose
fresh
complexion
and
whose
heart
together
Affliction
alters
PERDITA
One
of
these
is
true
I
think
affliction
may
subdue
the
cheek
But
not
take
in
the
mind
CAMILLO
Yea
say
you
so
There
shall
not
at
your
father
s
house
these
seven
years
Be
born
another
such
FLORIZEL
My
good
Camillo
She
is
as
forward
of
her
breeding
as
She
is
i
th
rear
o
our
birth
CAMILLO
I
cannot
say
tis
pity
She
lacks
instructions
for
she
seems
a
mistress
To
most
that
teach
PERDITA
Your
pardon
sir
for
this
I
ll
blush
you
thanks
FLORIZEL
My
prettiest
Perdita
But
O
the
thorns
we
stand
upon
Camillo
Preserver
of
my
father
now
of
me
The
medicine
of
our
house
how
shall
we
do
We
are
not
furnish
d
like
Bohemia
s
son
Nor
shall
appear
in
Sicilia
CAMILLO
My
lord
Fear
none
of
this
I
think
you
know
my
fortunes
Do
all
lie
there
It
shall
be
so
my
care
To
have
you
royally
appointed
as
if
The
scene
you
play
were
mine
For
instance
sir
That
you
may
know
you
shall
not
want
one
word
They
talk

Re
enter
AUTOLYCUS
AUTOLYCUS
Ha
ha
what
a
fool
Honesty
is
and
Trust
his
sworn
brother
a
very
simple
gentleman
I
have
sold
all
my
trumpery
not
a
counterfeit
stone
not
a
ribbon
glass
pomander
brooch
table
book
ballad
knife
tape
glove
shoe
tie
bracelet
horn
ring
to
keep
my
pack
from
fasting
They
throng
who
should
buy
first
as
if
my
trinkets
had
been
hallowed
and
brought
a
benediction
to
the
buyer
by
which
means
I
saw
whose
purse
was
best
in
picture
and
what
I
saw
to
my
good
use
I
rememb
red
My
clown
who
wants
but
something
to
be
a
reasonable
man
grew
so
in
love
with
the
wenches
song
that
he
would
not
stir
his
pettitoes
till
he
had
both
tune
and
words
which
so
drew
the
rest
of
the
herd
to
me
that
all
their
other
senses
stuck
in
ears
You
might
have
pinch
d
a
placket
it
was
senseless
twas
nothing
to
geld
a
codpiece
of
a
purse
I
would
have
fil
d
keys
off
that
hung
in
chains
No
hearing
no
feeling
but
my
sir
s
song
and
admiring
the
nothing
of
it
So
that
in
this
time
of
lethargy
I
pick
d
and
cut
most
of
their
festival
purses
and
had
not
the
old
man
come
in
with
whoobub
against
his
daughter
and
the
King
s
son
and
scar
d
my
choughs
from
the
chaff
I
had
not
left
a
purse
alive
in
the
whole
army
CAMILLO
FLORIZEL
and
PERDITA
come
forward
CAMILLO
Nay
but
my
letters
by
this
means
being
there
So
soon
as
you
arrive
shall
clear
that
doubt
FLORIZEL
And
those
that
you
ll
procure
from
King
Leontes
CAMILLO
Shall
satisfy
your
father
PERDITA
Happy
be
you
All
that
you
speak
shows
fair
CAMILLO
seeing
AUTOLYCUS
Who
have

here
We

make
an
instrument
of

Nothing

AUTOLYCUS

If
they

overheard
me
now
why

CAMILLO
How
now
good
fellow
Why
shak
st
thou
so
Fear
not

here
s
no

thee
AUTOLYCUS
I
am
a
poor
fellow
sir
CAMILLO
Why
be
so
still
here
s
nobody
will
steal
that
from
thee
Yet
for
the
outside
of
thy
poverty
we
must
make
an
exchange
therefore
discase
thee
instantly
thou
must
think
there
s
a
necessity
in
t
and
change
garments
with
this
gentleman
Though
the
pennyworth
on
his
side
be
the
worst
yet
hold
thee
there

Giving

AUTOLYCUS
I
am
a
poor

sir
Aside
I
know
ye
well
enough
CAMILLO
Nay
prithee

The
gentleman
is
half
flay

already
AUTOLYCUS
Are
you
in
camest
sir
Aside
I
smell
the
trick
on
t
FLORIZEL
Dispatch
I
prithee
AUTOLYCUS
Indeed
I
have
had
earnest
but
I
cannot
with
conscience
take
it
CAMILLO
Unbuckle
unbuckle
FLORIZEL
and
AUTOLYCUS
exchange
garments
Fortunate
mistress
let
my
prophecy
Come
home
to
ye
you
must
retire
yourself
Into
some
covert
take
your
sweetheart
s
hat
And
pluck
it
o
er
your
brows
muffle
your
face
Dismantle
you
and
as
you
can
disliken
The
truth
of
your
own
seeming
that
you
may
For
I
do
fear
eyes
over
to
shipboard
Get
undescried
PERDITA
I
see
the
play
so
lies
That
I
must
bear
a
part
CAMILLO
No
remedy
Have
you
done
there
FLORIZEL
Should
I
now
meet
my
father
He
would
not
call
me
son
CAMILLO
Nay
you
shall
have
no
hat
Giving
it
to
PERDITA
Come
lady
come
Farewell
my
friend
AUTOLYCUS
Adieu
sir
FLORIZEL
O
Perdita
what
have
we
twain
forgot
Pray
you
a
word
They
converse
apart
CAMILLO
Aside
What
I
do
next
shall
be
to
tell
the
King
Of
this
escape
and
whither
they
are
bound
Wherein
my
hope
is
I
shall
so
prevail
To
force
him
after
in
whose
company
I
shall
re
view
Sicilia
for
whose
sight
I
have
a
woman
s
longing
FLORIZEL
Fortune
speed
us
Thus
we
set
on
Camillo
to
th
sea
side
CAMILLO
The
swifter
speed
the
better
Exeunt
FLORIZEL
PERDITA
and
CAMILLO
AUTOLYCUS
I
understand
the
business
I
hear
it
To
have
an
open
ear
a
quick
eye
and
a
nimble
hand
is
necessary
for
a
cut
purse
a
good
nose
is
requisite
also
to
smell
out
work
for
th
other
senses
I
see
this
is
the
time
that
the
unjust
man
doth
thrive
What
an
exchange
had
this
been
without
boot
What
a
boot
is
here
with
this
exchange
Sure
the
gods
do
this
year
connive
at
us
and
we
may
do
anything
extempore
The
Prince
himself
is
about
a
piece
of
iniquity
stealing
away
from
his
father
with
his
clog
at
his
heels
If
I
thought
it
were
a
piece
of
honesty
to
acquaint
the
King
withal
I
would
not
do
t
I
hold
it
the
more
knavery
to
conceal
it
and
therein
am
I
constant
to
my
profession
Re
enter
CLOWN
and
SHEPHERD
Aside
aside
here
is
more
matter
for
a
hot
brain
Every
lane
s
end
every
shop
church
session
hanging
yields
a
careful
man
work
CLOWN
See
see
what
a
man
you
are
now
There
is
no
other
way
but
to
tell
the
King
she
s
a
changeling
and
none
of
your
flesh
and
blood
SHEPHERD
Nay
but
hear
me
CLOWN
Nay
but
hear
me
SHEPHERD
Go
to
then
CLOWN
She
being
none
of
your
flesh
and
blood
your
flesh
and
blood
has
not
offended
the
King
and
so
your
flesh
and
blood
is
not
to
be
punish
d
by
him
Show
those
things
you
found
about
her
those
secret
things
all
but
what
she
has
with
her
This
being
done
let
the
law
go
whistle
I
warrant
you
SHEPHERD
I
will
tell
the
King
all
every
word
yea
and
his
son
s
pranks
too
who
I
may
say
is
no
honest
man
neither
to
his
father
nor
to
me
to
go
about
to
make
me
the
King
s
brother
in
law
CLOWN
Indeed
brother
in
law
was
the
farthest
off
you
could
have
been
to
him
and
then
your
blood
had
been
the
dearer
by
I
know
how
much
an
ounce
AUTOLYCUS
Aside
Very
wisely
puppies
SHEPHERD
Well
let
us
to
the
King
There
is
that
in
this
fardel
will
make
him
scratch
his
beard
AUTOLYCUS
Aside
I
know
not
what
impediment
this
complaint
may
be
to
the
flight
of
my
master
CLOWN
Pray
heartily
he
be
at
palace
AUTOLYCUS
Aside
Though
I
am
not
naturally
honest
I
am
so
sometimes
by
chance
Let
me
pocket
up
my
pedlar
s
excrement
Takes
off
his
false
beard
How
now
rustics
Whither
are
you
bound
SHEPHERD
To
th
palace
an
it
like
your
worship
AUTOLYCUS
Your
affairs
there
what
with
whom
the
condition
of
that
fardel
the
place
of
your
dwelling
your
names
your
ages
of
what
having
breeding
and
anything
that
is
fitting
to
be
known
discover
CLOWN
We
are
but
plain
fellows
sir
AUTOLYCUS
A
lie
you
are
rough
and
hairy
Let
me
have
no
lying
it
becomes
none
but
tradesmen
and
they
often
give
us
soldiers
the
lie
but
we
pay
them
for
it
with
stamped
coin
not
stabbing
steel
therefore
they
do
not
give
us
the
lie
CLOWN
Your
worship
had
like
to
have
given
us
one
if
you
had
not
taken
yourself
with
the
manner
SHEPHERD
Are
you
a
courtier
an
t
like
you
sir
AUTOLYCUS
Whether
it
like
me
or
no
I
am
a
courtier
Seest
thou
not
the
air
of
the
court
in
these
enfoldings
Hath
not
my
gait
in
it
the
measure
of
the
court
Receives
not
thy
nose
court
odour
from
me
Reflect
I
not
on
thy
baseness
court
contempt
Think
st
thou
for
that
I
insinuate
that
toaze
from
thee
thy
business
I
am
therefore
no
courtier
I
am
courtier
cap
a
pe
and
one
that
will
either
push
on
or
pluck
back
thy
business
there
whereupon
I
command
the
to
open
thy
affair
SHEPHERD
My
business
sir
is
to
the
King
AUTOLYCUS
What
advocate
hast
thou
to
him
SHEPHERD
I
know
not
an
t
like
you
CLOWN
Advocate
s
the
court
word
for
a
pheasant
say
you
have
none
SHEPHERD
None
sir
I
have
no
pheasant
cock
nor
hen
AUTOLYCUS
How
blessed
are
we
that
are
not
simple
men
Yet
nature
might
have
made
me
as
these
are
Therefore
I
will
not
disdain
CLOWN
This
cannot
be
but
a
great
courtier
SHEPHERD
His
garments
are
rich
but
he
wears
them
not
handsomely
CLOWN
He
seems
to
be
the
more
noble
in
being
fantastical
A
great
man
I
ll
warrant
I
know
by
the
picking
on
s
teeth
AUTOLYCUS
The
fardel
there
What
s
i
th
fardel
Wherefore
that
box
SHEPHERD
Sir
there
lies
such
secrets
in
this
fardel
and
box
which
none
must
know
but
the
King
and
which
he
shall
know
within
this
hour
if
I
may
come
to
th
speech
of
him
AUTOLYCUS
Age
thou
hast
lost
thy
labour
SHEPHERD
Why
Sir
AUTOLYCUS
The
King
is
not
at
the
palace
he
is
gone
aboard
a
new
ship
to
purge
melancholy
and
air
himself
for
if
thou
be
st
capable
of
things
serious
thou
must
know
the
King
is
full
of
grief
SHEPHERD
So
tis
said
sir
about
his
son
that
should
have
married
a
shepherd
s
daughter
AUTOLYCUS
If
that
shepherd
be
not
in
hand
fast
let
him
fly
the
curses
he
shall
have
the
tortures
he
shall
feel
will
break
the
back
of
man
the
heart
of
monster
CLOWN
Think
you
so
sir
AUTOLYCUS
Not
he
alone
shall
suffer
what
wit
can
make
heavy
and
vengeance
bitter
but
those
that
are
germane
to
him
though
remov
d
fifty
times
shall
all
come
under
the
hangman
which
though
it
be
great
pity
yet
it
is
necessary
An
old
sheep
whistling
rogue
a
ram
tender
to
offer
to
have
his
daughter
come
into
grace
Some
say
he
shall
be
ston
d
but
that
death
is
too
soft
for
him
say
I
Draw
our
throne
into
a
sheep
cote
all
deaths
are
too
few
the
sharpest
too
easy
CLOWN
Has
the
old
man
e
er
a
son
sir
do
you
hear
an
t
like
you
sir
AUTOLYCUS
He
has
a
son
who
shall
be
flay
d
alive
then
nointed
over
with
honey
set
on
the
head
of
a
wasp
s
nest
then
stand
till
he
be
three
quarters
and
a
dram
dead
then
recover
d
again
with
aqua
vitae
or
some
other
hot
infusion
then
raw
as
he
is
and
in
the
hottest
day
prognostication
proclaims
shall
he
be
set
against
a
brick
wall
the
sun
looking
with
a
southward
eye
upon
him
where
he
is
to
behold
him
with
flies
blown
to
death
But
what
talk
we
of
these
traitorly
rascals
whose
miseries
are
to
be
smil
d
at
their
offences
being
so
capital
Tell
me
for
you
seem
to
be
honest
plain
men
what
you
have
to
the
King
Being
something
gently
consider
d
I

bring
you
where

is

your
persons
to
his

young
man
in

After

done
what
I
promised
SHEPHERD
Ay

the
moiety
Are

a
party
in
this
business
CLOWN
In
some
sort

but
though
my
case
be
a
pitiful
one
I
hope
I
shall
not
be
flay
d

of
it
AUTOLYCUS
O

CLOWN

Sir

AUTOLYCUS
If
I
had
a
mind
to
be
honest
I
see
Fortune
would
not
suffer

drops
booties

mouth
I
am
courted
now
with
a
double
occasion
gold

a
means
to
do
the
Prince
my
master
good
which
who
knows
how
that
may
turn
back

If

the
complaint
they
have
to
the
King
concerns
him
nothing
let
him
call
me
rogue
for
being
so
far
officious

I
am
proof
against
that
title
and
what
shame

belongs
to

To

SCENE

Sicilia
The
palace
of
LEONTES
Enter
LEONTES
CLEOMENES
DION
PAULINA
and
OTHERS
CLEOMENES
Sir
you
have
done
enough
and
have
perform
d
A
saint
like
sorrow
No
fault
could
you
make
Which
you
have
not
redeem
d
indeed
paid
down
More
penitence
than
done
trespass
At
the
last
Do
as
the
heavens
have
done
forget
your
evil
With
them
forgive
yourself
LEONTES
Whilst
I
remember
Her
and
her
virtues
I
cannot
forget
My
blemishes
in
them
and
so
still
think
of
The
wrong
I
did
myself
which
was
so
much
That
heirless
it
hath
made
my
kingdom
and
Destroy
d
the
sweet
st
companion
that
e
er
man
Bred
his
hopes
out
of
PAULINA
True
too
true
my
lord
If
one
by
one
you
wedded
all
the
world
Or
from
the
all
that
are
took
something
good
To
make
a
perfect
woman
she
you
kill
d
Would
be
unparallel
d
LEONTES
I
think
so
Kill
d
She
I
kill
d
I
did
so
but
thou
strik
st
me
Sorely
to
say
I
did
It
is
as
bitter
Upon
thy
tongue
as
in
my
thought
Now
good
now
Say
so
but
seldom
CLEOMENES
Not
at
all
good
lady
You
might
have
spoken
a
thousand
things
that
would
Have
done
the
time
more
benefit
and
grac
d
Your
kindness
better
PAULINA
You
are
one
of
those
Would
have
him
wed
again
DION
If
you
would
not
so
You
pity
not
the
state
nor
the
remembrance
Of
his
most
sovereign
name
consider
little
What
dangers
by
his
Highness
fail
of
issue
May
drop
upon
his
kingdom
and
devour
Incertain
lookers
on
What
were
more
holy
Than
to
rejoice
the
former
queen
is
well
What
holier
than
for
royalty
s
repair
For
present
comfort
and
for
future
good
To
bless
the
bed
of
majesty
again
With
a
sweet
fellow
to
t
PAULINA
There
is
none
worthy
Respecting
her
that
s
gone
Besides
the
gods
Will
have
fulfill
d
their
secret
purposes
For
has
not
the
divine
Apollo
said
Is
t
not
the
tenour
of
his
oracle
That
King
Leontes
shall
not
have
an
heir
Till
his
lost
child
be
found
Which
that
it
shall
Is
all
as
monstrous
to
our
human
reason
As
my
Antigonus
to
break
his
grave
And
come
again
to
me
who
on
my
life
Did
perish
with
the
infant
Tis
your
counsel
My
lord
should
to
the
heavens
be
contrary
Oppose
against
their
wills
To
LEONTES
Care
not
for
issue
The
crown
will
find
an
heir
Great
Alexander
Left
his
to
th
worthiest
so
his
successor
Was
like
to
be
the
best
LEONTES
Good
Paulina
Who
hast
the
memory
of
Hermione
I
know
in
honour
O
that
ever
I
Had
squar
d
me
to
thy
counsel
Then
even
now
I
might
have
look
d
upon
my
queen
s
full
eyes
Have
taken
treasure
from
her
lips
PAULINA
And
left
them
More
rich
for
what
they
yielded
LEONTES
Thou
speak
st
truth
No
more
such
wives
therefore
no
wife
One
worse
And
better
us
d
would
make
her
sainted
spirit
Again
possess
her
corpse
and
on
this
stage
Where
we
offend
her
now
appear
soul
vex
d
And
begin
Why
to
me
PAULINA
Had
she
such
power
She
had
just
cause
LEONTES
She
had
and
would
incense
me
To
murder
her
I
married
PAULINA
I
should
so
Were
I
the
ghost
that
walk
d
I
d
bid
you
mark
Her
eye
and
tell
me
for
what
dull
part
in
t
You
chose
her
then
I
d
shriek
that
even
your
ears
Should
rift
to
hear
me
and
the
words
that
follow
d
Should
be
Remember
mine
LEONTES
Stars
stars
And
all
eyes

dead
coals
Fear
thou
no
wife
I
ll
have
no
wife
Paulina
PAULINA
Will
you
swear
Never
to
marry
but
by
my
free
leave
LEONTES
Never
Paulina
so
be
blest
my
spirit
PAULINA
Then
good
my
lords
bear
witness
to
his
oath
CLEOMENES
You
tempt
him
over
much
PAULINA
Unless
another
As
like
Hermione
as
is
her
picture
Affront
his
eye
CLEOMENES
Good
madam
PAULINA
I
have
done
Yet
if
my
lord
will
marry
if
you
will
sir
No
remedy
but
you
will
give
me
the
office
To
choose
you
a
queen
She
shall
not
be
so
young
As
was
your
former
but
she
shall
be
such
As
walk
d
your
first
queen
s
ghost
it
should
take
joy
To
see
her
in
your
arms
LEONTES
My
true
Paulina
We
shall
not
marry
till
thou
bid
st
us
PAULINA
That
Shall
be
when
your
first
queen
s
again
in
breath
Never
till
then
Enter

GENTLEMAN
GENTLEMAN
One
that
gives
out
himself
Prince
Florizel
Son
of
Polixenes
with
his
princess
she
The
fairest
I
have
yet
beheld
desires
access
To
your
high
presence
LEONTES
What
with
him
He
comes
not
Like
to
his
father
s
greatness
His
approach
So
out
of
circumstance
and
sudden
tells
us
Tis
not
a
visitation
fram
d
but
forc
d
By
need
and
accident
What
train
GENTLEMAN
But
few
And
those
but

LEONTES
His
princess
say
you

him
GENTLEMAN
Ay
the
most
peerless
piece
of
earth
I
think
That

the
sun
shone
bright
on
PAULINA
O
Hermione
As
every
present
time
doth
boast
itself
Above
a
better
gone
so
must
thy
grave
Give
way
to
what
s
seen
now
Sir
you
yourself
Have
said
and
writ
so
but
your
writing
now
Is
colder
than
that
theme
She
had
not
been
Nor
was
not
to
be
equall
d
Thus
your
verse
Flow
d
with
her
beauty
once

shrewdly
ebb

To
say
you
have
seen
a
better
GENTLEMAN
Pardon
madam
The
one
I
have
almost
forgot
your
pardon
The
other
when
she
has
obtain
d
your
eye
Will
have
your
tongue
too
This
is
a
creature
Would
she
begin
a
sect
might
quench
the
zeal
Of
all
professors
else
make
proselytes
Of
who
she
but
bid
follow
PAULINA
How
not
women
GENTLEMAN
Women
will
love
her
that
she
is
a
woman
More
worth
than
any
man
men
that
she
is
The
rarest
of
all
women
