From
his
true
meant
design
Upon
his
place
And
with
full
line
of
his
authority
Governs
Lord
Angelo
a
man
whose
blood
Is
very
snow
broth
one
who
never
feels
The
wanton
stings
and
motions
of
the
sense
But
doth
rebate
and
blunt
his
natural
edge
With
profits
of
the
mind
study
and
fast
He
to
give
fear
to
use
and
liberty
Which
have
for
long
run
by
the
hideous
law
As
mice
by
lions
hath
pick
d
out
an
act
Under
whose
heavy
sense
your
brother
s
life
Falls
into
forfeit
he
arrests
him
on
it
And
follows
close
the
rigour
of
the
statute
To
make
him
an
example
All
hope
is
gone
Unless
you
have
the
grace
by
your
fair
prayer
To
soften
Angelo
And
that
s
my
pith
of
business
Twixt
you
and
your
poor
brother
ISABELLA
Doth
he
so
seek
his
life
LUCIO
Has
censur
d
him
Already
and
as
I
hear
the
Provost
hath
A
warrant
for
his
execution
ISABELLA
Alas
what
poor
ability
s
in
me
To
do
him
good
LUCIO
Assay
the
pow
r
you
have
ISABELLA
My
power
alas
I
doubt
LUCIO
Our
doubts
are
traitors
And
make
us
lose
the
good
we
oft
might
win
By
fearing
to
attempt
Go
to
Lord
Angelo
And
let
him
learn
to
know
when
maidens
sue
Men
give
like
gods
but
when
they
weep
and
kneel
All
their
petitions
are
as
freely
theirs
As
they
themselves
would
owe
them
ISABELLA
I
ll
see
what
I
can
do
LUCIO
But
speedily
ISABELLA
I
will
about
it
straight
No
longer
staying
but
to
give
the
Mother
Notice
of
my
affair
I
humbly
thank
you
Commend
me
to
my
brother
soon
at
night
I
ll
send
him
certain
word
of
my
success
LUCIO
I
take
my
leave
of
you
ISABELLA
Good
sir
adieu

Scene
I
A
hall
in
ANGELO
S
house
Enter
ANGELO
ESCALUS
a
JUSTICE
PROVOST
OFFICERS
and
other
ATTENDANTS
ANGELO
We
must
not
make
a
scarecrow
of
the
law
Setting
it
up
to
fear
the
birds
of
prey
And
let
it
keep
one
shape
till
custom
make
it
Their
perch
and
not
their
terror
ESCALUS
Ay
but
yet
Let
us
be
keen
and
rather
cut
a
little
Than
fall
and
bruise
to
death
Alas
this
gentleman
Whom
I
would
save
had
a
most
noble
father
Let
but
your
honour
know
Whom
I
believe
to
be
most
strait
in
virtue
That
in
the
working
of
your
own
affections
Had
time
coher
d
with
place
or
place
with
wishing
Or
that
the
resolute
acting
of
our
blood
Could
have
attain
d
th
effect
of
your
own
purpose
Whether
you
had
not
sometime
in
your
life
Err
d
in
this
point
which
now
you
censure
him
And
pull
d
the
law
upon
you
ANGELO
Tis
one
thing
to
be
tempted
Escalus
Another
thing
to
fall
I
not
deny
The
jury
passing
on
the
prisoner
s
life
May
in
the
sworn
twelve
have
a
thief
or
two
Guiltier
than
him
they
try
What
s
open
made
to
justice
That
justice
seizes
What
knows
the
laws
That
thieves
do
pass
on
thieves
Tis
very
pregnant
The
jewel
that
we
find
we
stoop
and
take
t
Because
we
see
it
but
what
we
do
not
see
We
tread
upon
and
never
think
of
it
You
may
not
so
extenuate
his
offence
For
I
have
had
such
faults
but
rather
tell
me
When
I
that
censure
him
do
so
offend
Let
mine
own
judgment
pattern
out
my
death
And
nothing
come
in
partial
Sir
he
must
die
ESCALUS
Be
it
as
your
wisdom
will
ANGELO
Where
is
the
Provost
PROVOST
Here
if
it
like
your
honour
ANGELO
See
that
Claudio
Be
executed
by
nine
to
morrow
morning
Bring
him
his
confessor
let
him
be
prepar
d
For
that
s
the
utmost
of
his
pilgrimage
Exit
PROVOST
ESCALUS
Aside
Well
heaven
forgive
him
and
forgive
us
all
Some
rise
by
sin
and
some
by
virtue
fall
Some
run
from
breaks
of
ice
and
answer
none
And
some
condemned
for
a
fault
alone
Enter
ELBOW
and
OFFICERS
with
FROTH
and
POMPEY
ELBOW
Come
bring
them
away
if
these
be
good
people
in
a
commonweal
that
do
nothing
but
use
their
abuses
in
common
houses
I
know
no
law
bring
them
away
ANGELO
How
now
sir
What
s
your
name
and
what
s
the
matter
ELBOW
If
it
please
your
honour
I
am
the
poor
Duke
s
constable
and
my
name
is
Elbow
I
do
lean
upon
justice
sir
and
do
bring
in
here
before
your
good
honour
two
notorious
benefactors
ANGELO
Benefactors
Well
what
benefactors
are
they
Are
they
not
malefactors
ELBOW
If
it
please
your
honour
I
know
not
well
what
they
are
but
precise
villains
they
are
that
I
am
sure
of
and
void
of
all
profanation
in
the
world
that
good
Christians
ought
to
have
ESCALUS
This
comes
off
well
here
s
a
wise
officer
ANGELO
Go
to
what
quality
are
they
of
Elbow
is
your
name
Why
dost
thou
not
speak
Elbow
POMPEY
He
cannot
sir
he
s
out
at
elbow
ANGELO
What
are
you
sir
ELBOW
He
sir
A
tapster
sir
parcel
bawd
one
that
serves
a
bad
woman
whose
house
sir
was
as
they
say
pluck
d
down
in
the
suburbs
and
now
she
professes
a
hot
house
which
I
think
is
a
very
ill
house
too
ESCALUS
How
know
you
that
ELBOW
My
Wife
sir
whom
I
detest
before
heaven
and
your
honour
ESCALUS
How
thy
wife
ELBOW
Ay
sir
whom
I
thank
heaven
is
an
honest
woman
ESCALUS
Dost
thou
detest
her
therefore
ELBOW
I
say
sir
I
will
detest
myself
also
as
well
as
she
that
this
house
if
it
be
not
a
bawd
s
house
it
is
pity
of
her
life
for
it
is
a
naughty
house
ESCALUS
How
dost
thou
know
that
constable
ELBOW
Marry
sir
by
my
wife
who
if
she
had
been
a
woman
cardinally
given
might
have
been
accus
d
in
fornication
adultery
and
all
uncleanliness
there
ESCALUS
By
the
woman
s
means
ELBOW
Ay
sir
by
Mistress
Overdone
s
means
but
as
she
spit
in
his
face
so
she
defied
him
POMPEY
Sir
if
it
please
your
honour
this
is
not
so
ELBOW
Prove
it
before
these
varlets
here
thou
honourable
man
prove
it
ESCALUS
Do
you
hear
how
he
misplaces
POMPEY
Sir
she
came
in
great
with
child
and
longing
saving
your
honour
s
reverence
for
stew
d
prunes
Sir
we
had
but
two
in
the
house
which
at
that
very
distant
time
stood
as
it
were
in
a
fruit
dish
a
dish
of
some
three
pence
your
honours
have
seen
such
dishes
they
are
not
China
dishes
but
very
good
dishes
ESCALUS
Go
to
go
to
no
matter
for
the
dish
sir
POMPEY
No
indeed
sir
not
of
a
pin
you
are
therein
in
the
right
but
to
the
point
As
I
say
this
Mistress
Elbow
being
as
I
say
with
child
and
being
great
bellied
and
longing
as
I
said
for
prunes
and
having
but
two
in
the
dish
as
I
said
Master
Froth
here
this
very
man
having
eaten
the
rest
as
I
said
and
as
I
say
paying
for
them
very
honestly
for
as
you
know
Master
Froth
I
could
not
give
you
three
pence
again
FROTH
No
indeed
POMPEY
Very
well
you
being
then
if
you
be
rememb
red
cracking
the
stones
of
the
foresaid
prunes
FROTH
Ay
so
I
did
indeed
POMPEY
Why
very
well
I
telling
you
then
if
you
be
rememb
red
that
such
a
one
and
such
a
one
were
past
cure
of
the
thing
you
wot
of
unless
they
kept
very
good
diet
as
I
told
you
FROTH
All
this
is
true
POMPEY
Why
very
well
then
ESCALUS
Come

tedious
fool
To

was
done

hath
cause
to
complain
of
Come

what
was
done
to
her
POMPEY

ESCALUS
No

think
of
the
trade
Pompey
Is
it
a
lawful
trade
POMPEY
If
the
law
would
allow
it
sir
ESCALUS
But
the
law

not
be
allowed

POMPEY
Does

bawds
ESCALUS
There

pretty
orders

hanging
POMPEY
If

for
ten
year
together

commission
for
more
heads
if
this

hold

Vienna
ten
year
I

the
fairest

If

ESCALUS
Thank

Seven

some
time
You

seven
years
together
ELBOW
And
a

sufficient
to

it
ELBOW
Faith

JUSTICE
Lord
Angelo

It

Mercy

There

Hadst

Why

Lest

Under

When

to

Please

ANGELO
Well
what
s
your
suit
ISABELLA
There
is
a
vice
that
most
I
do
abhor
And
most
desire
should
meet
the
blow
of
justice
For
which
I
would
not
plead

that
I
must
For

ANGELO
Well
the
matter
ISABELLA
I
have
a
brother
is
condemn
d
to
die
I
do
beseech
you
let
it
be
his
fault
And
not
my
brother
PROVOST
Aside
Heaven
give
thee
moving
graces
ANGELO
Condemn
the
fault
and
not
the
actor
of
it
Why
every
fault
s
condemn
d
ere
it
be
done
Mine
were
the
very
cipher
of
a
function
To
fine
the
faults
whose
fine
stands
in
record
And
let
go
by
the
actor
ISABELLA
O
just
but
severe
law
I
had
a
brother
then
Heaven
keep
your
honour
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
Give
t
not
o
er
so
to
him
again
entreat
him
Kneel
down
before
him
hang
upon
his
gown
You
are
too
cold
if
you
should
need
a
pin
You
could
not
with
more
tame
a
tongue
desire
it
To
him
I
say
ISABELLA
Must
he
needs
die
ANGELO
Maiden
no
remedy
ISABELLA
Yes
I
do
think
that
you
might
pardon
him
And
neither
heaven
nor
man
grieve
at
the
mercy
ANGELO
I
will
not
do
t
ISABELLA
But
can
you
if
you
would
ANGELO
Look
what
I
will
not
that
I
cannot
do
ISABELLA
But
might
you
do
t
and
do
the
world
no
wrong
If
so
your
heart
were
touch
d
with
that
remorse
As
mine
is
to
him
ANGELO
He
s
sentenc
d
tis
too
late
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
You
are
too
cold
ISABELLA
Too
late
Why
no
I
that
do
speak
a
word
May
call
it
back
again
Well
believe
this
No
ceremony
that
to
great
ones
longs
Not
the
king
s
crown
nor
the
deputed
sword
The
marshal
s
truncheon
nor
the
judge
s
robe
Become
them
with
one
half
so
good
a
grace
As
mercy
does
If
he
had
been
as
you
and
you
as
he
You
would
have
slipp
d
like
him
but
he
like
you
Would
not
have
been
so
stern
ANGELO
Pray
you
be
gone
ISABELLA
I
would
to
heaven
I
had
your
potency
And
you
were
Isabel
Should
it
then
be
thus
No
I
would
tell
what
twere
to
be
a
judge
And
what
a
prisoner
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
Ay
touch
him
there
s
the
vein
ANGELO
Your
brother
is
a
forfeit
of
the
law
And
you
but
waste
your
words
ISABELLA
Alas
Alas
Why
all
the
souls
that
were
were
forfeit
once
And
He
that
might
the
vantage
best
have
took
Found
out
the
remedy
How
would
you
be
If
He
which
is
the
top
of
judgment
should
But
judge
you
as
you
are
O
think
on
that
And
mercy
then
will
breathe
within
your
lips
Like
man
new
made
ANGELO
Be
you
content
fair
maid
It
is
the
law
not
I
condemn
your
brother
Were
he
my
kinsman
brother
or
my
son
It
should
be
thus
with
him
He
must
die
to
morrow
ISABELLA
To
morrow
O
that
s
sudden
Spare
him
spare
him
He
s
not
prepar
d
for
death
Even
for
our
kitchens
We
kill
the
fowl
of
season
shall
we
serve
heaven
With
less
respect
than
we
do
minister
To
our
gross
selves
Good
good
my
lord
bethink
you
Who
is
it
that
hath
died
for
this
offence
There
s
many
have
committed
it
LUCIO
Aside
Ay
well
said
ANGELO
The
law
hath
not
been
dead
though
it
hath
slept
Those
many
had
not
dar
d
to
do
that
evil
If
the
first
that
did
th
edict
infringe
Had
answer
d
for
his
deed
Now
tis
awake
Takes
note
of
what
is
done
and
like
a
prophet
Looks
in
a
glass
that
shows
what
future
evils
Either
now
or
by
remissness
new
conceiv
d
And
so
in
progress
to
be
hatch
d
and
born
Are
now
to
have
no
successive
degrees
But
here
they
live
to
end
ISABELLA
Yet
show
some
pity
ANGELO
I
show
it
most
of
all
when
I
show
justice
For
then
I
pity
those
I
do
not
know
Which
a
dismiss
d
offence
would
after
gall
And
do
him
right
that
answering
one
foul
wrong
Lives
not
to
act
another
Be
satisfied
Your
brother
dies
to
morrow
be
content
ISABELLA
So
you
must
be
the
first
that
gives
this
sentence
And
he
that
suffers
O
it
is
excellent
To
have
a
giant
s
strength
But
it
is
tyrannous
To
use
it
like
a
giant
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
That
s
well
said
ISABELLA
Could
great
men
thunder
As
Jove
himself
does
Jove
would
never
be
quiet
For
every
pelting
petty
officer
Would
use
his
heaven
for
thunder
Nothing
but
thunder
Merciful
Heaven
Thou
rather
with
thy
sharp
and
sulphurous
bolt
Splits
the
unwedgeable
and
gnarled
oak
Than
the
soft
myrtle
But
man
proud
man
Dress
d
in
a
little
brief
authority
Most
ignorant
of
what
he
s
most
assur
d
His
glassy
essence
like
an
angry
ape
Plays
such
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
As
makes
the
angels
weep
who
with
our
speens
Would
all
themselves
laugh
mortal
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
O
to
him
to
him
wench
He
will
relent
He
s
coming
I
perceive
t
PROVOST
Aside
Pray
heaven
she
win
him
ISABELLA
We
cannot
weigh
our
brother
with
ourself
Great
men
may
jest
with
saints
tis
wit
in
them
But
in
the
less
foul
profanation
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
Thou
rt
i
th
right
girl
more
o
that
ISABELLA
That
in
the
captain
s
but
a
choleric
word
Which
in
the
soldier
is
flat
blasphemy
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
Art
avis
d
o
that
More
on
t
ANGELO
Why
do
you
put
these
sayings
upon
me
ISABELLA
Because
authority
though
it
err
like
others
Hath
yet
a
kind
of
medicine
in
itself
That
skins
the
vice
o
th
top
Go
to
your
bosom
Knock
there
and
ask
your
heart
what
it
doth
know
That
s
like
my
brother
s
fault
If
it
confess
A
natural
guiltiness
such
as
is
his
Let
it
not
sound
a
thought
upon
your
tongue
Against
my
brother
s
life
ANGELO
Aside
She
speaks
and
tis
Such
sense
that
my
sense
breeds
with
it
Fare
you
well
ISABELLA
Gentle
my
lord
turn
back
ANGELO
I
will
bethink
me
Come
again
to
morrow
ISABELLA
Hark
how
I
ll
bribe
you
good
my
lord
turn
back
ANGELO
How
bribe
me
ISABELLA
Ay
with
such
gifts
that
heaven
shall
share
with
you
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
You
had
marr
d
all
else
ISABELLA
Not
with
fond
sicles
of
the
tested
gold
Or
stones
whose
rate
are
either
rich
or
poor
As
fancy
values
them
but
with
true
prayers
That
shall
be
up
at
heaven
and
enter
there
Ere
sun
rise
prayers
from
preserved
souls
From
fasting
maids
whose
minds
are
dedicate
To
nothing
temporal
ANGELO
Well
come
to
me
to
morrow
LUCIO
To
ISABELLA
Go
to
tis
well
away
ISABELLA
Heaven
keep
your
honour
safe
ANGELO
Aside
Amen
for
I
Am
that
way
going
to
temptation
Where
prayers
cross
