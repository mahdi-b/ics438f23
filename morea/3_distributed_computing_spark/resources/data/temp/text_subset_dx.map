The

to

thereby
grows
direct

It
is
religion
that

make

thou
hast
sworn
against

By

But
thou
dost
swear

forsworn

thy

in

Attended
with

Is
all

wanton

Sound

thou

Or
if
that
surly

melancholy
Had
bak

made
it
heavy
thick
Which
else
runs
tickling
up

Making

keep
men

And
strain
their

A

Or

Hear
me
without
thine

make
reply
Without
a
tongue
using
conceit
alone
Without

I

But
now

Cain

first

To
him
that
did

yesterday
suspire
There
was
not
such
a

born
But
now
will
canker
sorrow
eat
my
bud
And
chase
the
native

from

And
he
will
look
as
hollow
as

As
dim

meagre
as

And
so
he
ll
die

rising
so
again
When
I
shall

you

No
no

Tis
strange

think
how
much
King
John
hath
lost
In
this
which
he
accounts
so
clearly
won
Are
not
you
griev

that
Arthur
is
his
prisoner
LEWIS
As
heartily
as
he
is
glad
he
hath
him
PANDULPH
Your
mind
is
all
as
youthful
as
your

Now
hear
me
speak
with
a
prophetic
spirit
For
even
the
breath
of
what
I
mean
to
speak
Shall
blow
each
dust
each
straw
each
little
rub
Out
of
the

which
shall
directly
lead
Thy

to
England

And
therefore
mark
John

Arthur
and
it
cannot
be
That
whiles
warm
life
plays
in
that
infant
s

The
misplac

John
should
entertain
an

One

Makes

up
That

then
Arthur
needs
must
fall
So
be
it
for

But
what

gain
by

You

conspire
with
you
For
he
that
steeps
his
safety
in
true
blood
Shall
find
but
bloody
safety
and
untrue
This
act
so
evilly
borne
shall
cool
the
hearts
Of
all
his
people
and
freeze
up
their
zeal
That
none
so
small
advantage
shall
step
forth
To
check
his
reign
but
they
will
cherish
it
No
natural
exhalation
in
the
sky
No
scope
of
nature
no
distemper
d
day
No
common
wind
no
customed
event
But
they
will
pluck
away
his
natural
cause
And
call
them
meteors
prodigies
and
signs
Abortives
presages
and
tongues
of
heaven
Plainly
denouncing
vengeance
upon
John
LEWIS
May
be
he
will
not
touch
young
Arthur
s
life
But
hold
himself
safe
in
his
prisonment
PANDULPH
O
Sir
when
he
shall
hear
of
your
approach
If
that
young
Arthur
be
not
gone
already
Even
at
that
news
he
dies
and
then
the
hearts
Of
all
his
people
shall
revolt
from
him
And
kiss
the
lips
of
unacquainted
change
And
pick
strong
matter
of
revolt
and
wrath
Out
of
the
bloody
fingers
ends
of
john
Methinks
I
see
this
hurly
all
on
foot
And
O
what
better
matter
breeds
for
you
Than
I
have

The
bastard
Faulconbridge
Is
now
in
England
ransacking
the
Church
Offending
charity
if
but
a
dozen
French
Were
there
in
arms
they
would
be
as

To

thousand

side

O
noble
Dauphin
Go
with

to

King
Tis
wonderful
What
may

of
their
discontent
Now
that

For

SCENE
1
England
A
castle
Enter
HUBERT
and
EXECUTIONERS
HUBERT
Heat
me
these
irons
hot
and
look
thou
stand
Within
the
arras
When
I
strike
my
foot
Upon
the
bosom
of
the
ground
rush
forth
And
bind
the
boy
which
you
shall
find
with
me
Fast
to
the
chair
Be
heedful
hence
and
watch
EXECUTIONER
I
hope
your
warrant
will
bear
out
the
deed
HUBERT
Uncleanly
scruples
Fear
not
you
Look

t
Exeunt
EXECUTIONERS
Young
lad
come
forth
I
have
to
say
with
you
Enter
ARTHUR
ARTHUR
Good
morrow
Hubert
HUBERT
Good
morrow
little
Prince
ARTHUR
As
little
prince
having
so
great
a
tide
To
be
more
prince
as
may
be
You
are
sad
HUBERT
Indeed
I
have
been
merrier
ARTHUR
Mercy
on
me
Methinks
no
body
should
be
sad
but
I
Yet
I
remember
when
I
was
in
France
Young
gentlemen
would
be
as
sad
as
night
Only
for
wantonness
By
my
christendom
So
I
were
out
of
prison
and
kept
sheep
I
should
be
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
And
so
I
would
be
here
but
that
I
doubt
My
uncle
practises
more
harm
to
me
He
is
afraid
of
me
and
I
of
him
Is
it
my
fault
that
I
was
Geffrey
s
son
No
indeed
ist
not
and
I
would
to
heaven
I
were
your
son
so
you
would
love
me
Hubert
HUBERT
Aside
If
I
talk
to
him
with
his
innocent
prate
He
will
awake
my
mercy
which
lies
dead
Therefore
I
will
be
sudden
and
dispatch
ARTHUR
Are
you
sick
Hubert
You
look
pale
to
day
In
sooth
I
would
you
were
a
little
sick
That
I
might
sit
all
night
and
watch
with
you
I
warrant
I
love
you
more
than
you
do
me
HUBERT
Aside
His
words
do
take
possession
of
my
bosom
Read
here
young
Arthur
Showing
a
paper
Aside
How
now
foolish
rheum
Turning
dispiteous
torture
out
of
door
I
must
be
brief
lest
resolution
drop
Out
at
mine
eyes
in
tender
womanish
tears
Can
you
not
read
it
Is
it
not
fair
writ
ARTHUR
Too
fairly
Hubert
for
so
foul
effect
Must
you
with
hot
irons
burn
out
both
mine
eyes
HUBERT
Young
boy
I
must
ARTHUR
And
will
you
HUBERT
And
I
will
ARTHUR
Have
you
the
heart
When
your
head
did
but
ache
I
knit
my
handkerchief
about
your
brows
The
best
I
had
a
princess
wrought
it
me
And
I
did
never
ask
it
you
again
And
with
my
hand
at
midnight
held
your
head
And
like
the
watchful
minutes
to
the
hour
Still
and
anon
cheer
d
up
the
heavy
time
Saying
What
lack
you
and
Where
lies
your
grief
Or
What
good
love
may
I
perform
for
you
Many
a
poor
man
s
son
would
have
lyen
still
And
ne
er
have
spoke
a
loving
word
to
you
But
you
at
your
sick
service
had
a
prince
Nay
you
may
think
my
love
was
crafty
love
And
call
it
cunning
Do
an
if
you
will
If
heaven
be
pleas
d
that
you
must
use
me
ill
Why
then
you
must
Will
you
put
out
mine
eyes
These
eyes
that
never
did
nor
never
shall
So
much
as
frown
on
you
HUBERT
I
have
sworn
to
do
it
And
with
hot
irons
must
I
burn
them
out
ARTHUR
Ah
none
but
in
this
iron
age
would
do
it
The
iron
of
itself
though
heat
red
hot
Approaching
near
these
eyes
would
drink
my
tears
And
quench
his
fiery
indignation
Even
in
the
matter
of
mine
innocence
Nay
after
that
consume
away
in
rust
But
for
containing
fire
to
harm
mine
eye
Are
you
more
stubborn
hard
than
hammer
d
iron
An
if
an
angel
should
have
come
to
me
And
told
me
Hubert
should
put
out
mine
eyes
I
would
not
have
believ
d
him
no
tongue
but
Hubert
s
HUBERT
Stamps
Come
forth
Re
enter
EXECUTIONERS
With
cord
irons
etc
Do
as
I
bid
you
do
ARTHUR
O
save
me
Hubert
save
me
My
eyes
are
out
Even
with
the
fierce
looks
of
these
bloody
men
HUBERT
Give
me
the
iron
I
say
and
bind
him
here
ARTHUR
Alas
what
need
you
be
so
boist
rous
rough
I
will
not
struggle
I
will
stand
stone
still
For
heaven
sake
Hubert
let
me
not
be
bound
Nay
hear
me
Hubert
Drive
these
men
away
And
I
will
sit
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
I
will
not
stir
nor
wince
nor
speak
a
word
Nor
look
upon
the
iron
angrily
Thrust
but
these
men
away
and
I
ll
forgive
you
Whatever
torment
you
do
put
me
to
HUBERT
Go
stand
within
let
me
alone
with
him
EXECUTIONER
I
am
best
pleas
d
to
be
from
such
a
deed
Exeunt
EXECUTIONERS
ARTHUR
Alas
I
then
have
chid
away
my
friend
He
hath
a
stern
look
but
a
gentle
heart
Let
him
come
back
that
his
compassion
may
Give
life
to
yours
HUBERT
Come
boy
prepare
yourself
ARTHUR
Is
there
no
remedy
HUBERT
None
but
to
lose
your
eyes
ARTHUR
O
heaven
that
there
were
but
a
mote
in
yours
A
grain
a
dust
a
gnat
a
wandering
hair
Any
annoyance
in
that
precious
sense
Then
feeling
what
small
things
are
boisterous
there
Your
vile
intent
must
needs
seem
horrible
HUBERT
Is
this
your
promise
Go
to
hold
your
tongue
ARTHUR
Hubert
the
utterance
of
a
brace
of
tongues
Must
needs
want
pleading
for
a
pair
of
eyes
Let
me
not
hold
my
tongue
let
me
not
Hubert
Or
Hubert
if
you
will
cut
out
my
tongue
So
I
may
keep
mine
eyes
O
spare
mine
eyes
Though
to
no
use
but
still
to
look
on
you
Lo
by
my
troth
the
instrument
is
cold
