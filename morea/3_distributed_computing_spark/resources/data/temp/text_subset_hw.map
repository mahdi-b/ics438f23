LUCIUS
Bring
down
the
devil
for

must
not

So
sweet
a
death
as
hanging
presently
AARON
If
there
be
devils
would
I
were
a
devil
To
live
and
burn
in
everlasting
fire
So
I
might
have
your
company
in

But
to
torment
you

my
bitter

SCENE
II
Rome
Before
TITUS
house
Enter
TAMORA
and
her
two
sons
DEMETRIUS
and
CHIRON
disguised
TAMORA
Thus
in
this
strange
and
sad
habiliment
I
will
encounter
with
Andronicus
And
say
I
am
Revenge
sent
from
below
To
join
with
him
and
right
his
heinous
wrongs
Knock
at
his
study
where
they
say
he
keeps
To
ruminate
strange
plots
of
dire
revenge
Tell
him
Revenge
is
come
to
join
with
him
And
work
confusion
on
his
enemies
They
knock
and
TITUS
opens
his
study
door
above
TITUS
Who
doth
molest
my
contemplation
Is
it
your
trick
to
make
me
ope
the
door
That
so
my
sad
decrees
may
fly
away
And
all
my
study
be
to
no
effect
You
are
deceiv
d
for
what
I
mean
to
do
See
here
in
bloody
lines
I
have
set
down
And
what
is
written
shall
be
executed
TAMORA
Titus
I
am
come
to
talk
with
thee
TITUS
No
not
a
word
How
can
I
grace
my
talk
Wanting
a
hand
to
give
it
that
accord
Thou
hast
the
odds
of
me
therefore
no
more
TAMORA
If
thou
didst
know
me
thou
wouldst
talk
with
me
TITUS
I
am
not
mad
I
know
thee
well
enough
Witness
this
wretched
stump
witness
these
crimson
lines
Witness
these
trenches
made
by
grief
and
care
Witness
the
tiring
day
and
heavy
night
Witness
all
sorrow
that
I
know
thee
well
For
our
proud
Empress
mighty
Tamora
Is
not
thy
coming
for
my
other
hand
TAMORA
Know
thou
sad
man
I
am
not
Tamora
She
is
thy
enemy
and
I
thy
friend
I
am
Revenge
sent
from
th
infernal
kingdom
To
ease
the
gnawing
vulture
of
thy
mind
By
working
wreakful
vengeance
on
thy
foes
Come
down
and
welcome
me
to
this
world
s
light
Confer
with
me
of
murder
and
of
death
There
s
not
a
hollow
cave
or
lurking
place
No
vast
obscurity
or
misty
vale
Where
bloody
murder
or
detested
rape
Can
couch
for
fear
but
I
will
find
them
out
And
in
their
ears
tell
them
my
dreadful
name
Revenge
which
makes
the
foul
offender
quake
TITUS
Art
thou
Revenge
and
art
thou
sent
to
me
To
be
a
torment
to
mine
enemies
TAMORA
I
am
therefore
come
down
and
welcome
me
TITUS
Do
me
some
service
ere
I
come
to
thee
Lo
by
thy
side
where
Rape
and
Murder
stands
Now
give
some
surance
that
thou
art
Revenge
Stab
them
or
tear
them
on
thy
chariot
wheels
And
then
I
ll
come
and
be
thy
waggoner
And
whirl
along
with
thee
about
the
globes
Provide
thee
two
proper
palfreys
black
as
jet
To
hale
thy
vengeful
waggon
swift
away
And
find
out
murderers
in
their
guilty
caves
And
when
thy
car
is
loaden
with
their
heads
I
will
dismount
and
by
thy
waggon
wheel
Trot
like
a
servile
footman
all
day
long
Even
from
Hyperion
s
rising
in
the
east
Until
his
very
downfall
in
the
sea
And
day
by
day
I
ll
do
this
heavy
task
So
thou
destroy
Rapine
and
Murder
there
TAMORA
These
are
my
ministers
and
come
with
me
TITUS
Are
they
thy
ministers
What
are
they
call
d
TAMORA
Rape
and
Murder
therefore
called
so
Cause
they
take
vengeance
of
such
kind
of
men
TITUS
Good
Lord
how
like
the
Empress
sons
they
are
And
you
the
Empress
But
we
worldly
men
Have
miserable
mad
mistaking
eyes
O
sweet
Revenge
now
do
I
come
to
thee
And
if
one
arm
s
embracement
will
content
thee
I
will
embrace
thee
in
it
by
and
by
TAMORA
This
closing
with
him
fits
his
lunacy
Whate
er
I
forge
to
feed
his
brain
sick
humours
Do
you
uphold
and
maintain
in
your
speeches
For
now
he
firmly
takes
me
for
Revenge
And
being
credulous
in
this
mad
thought
I
ll
make
him
send
for
Lucius
his
son
And
whilst
I
at
a
banquet
hold
him
sure
I
ll
find
some
cunning
practice
out
of
hand
To
scatter
and
disperse
the
giddy
Goths
Or
at
the
least
make
them
his
enemies
See
here
he
comes
and
I
must
ply
my
theme
Enter
TITUS
below
TITUS
Long
have
I
been
forlorn
and
all
for
thee
Welcome

are
welcome

How
like
the
Empress

her
sons
you
are
Well
are
you
fitted
had
you
but
a
Moor
Could
not
all
hell
afford
you
such
a
devil
For
well
I
wot
the
Empress
never
wags
But
in
her
company
there
is
a
Moor
And
would
you
represent
our
queen
aright
It
were
convenient
you
had
such
a
devil
But
welcome
as
you
are
What
shall
we
do

What
wouldst
thou

wrong
And

Go

There

a
queen
attended
by
a
Moor
Well
shalt
thou
know
her
by
thine
own
proportion
For
up
and
down
she
doth
resemble
thee
I
pray
thee
do
on
them
some
violent
death
They
have
been
violent
to
me
and
mine
TAMORA
Well
hast
thou
lesson
d
us
this
shall
we
do
But
would
it
please
thee
good
Andronicus
To
send
for
Lucius
thy
thrice
valiant
son
Who
leads
towards
Rome
a
band
of
warlike
Goths
And
bid
him

When

The

great
tumult
LUCIUS
MARCUS
and
their
friends
go
up
into
the
balcony
MARCUS
You
sad
fac
d
men
people
and
sons
of
Rome
By
uproars
sever
d
as
a
flight
of
fowl
Scatter
d
by
winds
and
high
tempestuous
gusts
O
let
me
teach
you
how
to
knit
again
This
scattered
corn
into
one
mutual
sheaf
These
broken
limbs
again
into
one
body
Lest
Rome
herself
be
bane
unto
herself
And
she
whom
mighty
kingdoms
curtsy
to
Like
a
forlorn
and
desperate
castaway
Do
shameful
execution
on
herself
But
if
my
frosty
signs
and
chaps
of
age
Grave
witnesses
of
true
experience
Cannot
induce
you
to
attend
my
words
To
Lucius
Speak
Rome
s
dear
friend
as
erst
our
ancestor
When
with
his
solemn
tongue
he
did
discourse
To
love
sick
Dido
s
sad
attending
ear
The
story
of
that
baleful
burning
night
When
subtle
Greeks
surpris
d
King
Priam
s
Troy
Tell
us
what
Sinon
hath
bewitch
d
our
ears
Or
who
hath
brought
the
fatal
engine
in
That
gives
our
Troy
our
Rome
the
civil
wound
My
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
Nor
can
I
utter
all
our
bitter
grief
But
floods
of
tears
will
drown
my
oratory
And
break
my
utt
rance
even
in
the
time
When
it
should
move
ye
to
attend
me
most
And
force
you
to
commiseration
Here
s
Rome
s
young
Captain
let
him
tell
the
tale
While
I
stand
by
and
weep
to
hear
him
speak
LUCIUS
Then
gracious
auditory
be
it
known
to
you
That
Chiron
and
the
damn
d
Demetrius
Were
they
that
murd
red
our
Emperor
s
brother
And
they
it
were
that
ravished
our
sister
For
their
fell
faults
our
brothers
were
beheaded
Our
father
s
tears
despis
d
and
basely
cozen
d
Of
that
true
hand
that
fought
Rome
s
quarrel
out
And
sent
her
enemies
unto
the
grave
Lastly
myself
unkindly
banished
The
gates
shut
on
me
and
turn
d
weeping
out
To
beg
relief
among
Rome
s
enemies
Who
drown
d
their
enmity
in
my
true
tears
And
op
d
their
arms
to
embrace
me
as
a
friend
I
am
the
turned
forth
be
it
known
to
you
That
have
preserv
d
her
welfare
in
my
blood
And
from
her
bosom
took
the
enemy
s
point
Sheathing
the
steel
in
my
advent
rous
body
Alas
you
know
I
am
no
vaunter
I
My
scars
can
witness
dumb
although
they
are
That
my
report
is
just
and
full
of
truth
But
soft
methinks
I
do
digress
too
much
Citing
my
worthless
praise
O
pardon
me
For
when
no
friends
are
by
men
praise
themselves
MARCUS
Now
is
my
turn
to
speak
Behold
the
child
Pointing
to
the
CHILD
in
an
attendant
s
arms
Of
this
was
Tamora
delivered
The
issue
of
an
irreligious
Moor
Chief
architect
and
plotter
of
these
woes
The
villain
is
alive
in
Titus
house
Damn
d
as
he
is
to
witness
this
is
true
Now
judge
what
cause
had
Titus
to
revenge
These
wrongs
unspeakable
past
patience
Or
more
than
any
living
man
could
bear
Now
have
you
heard
the
truth
what
say
you
Romans
Have
we
done
aught
amiss
show
us
wherein
And
from
the
place
where
you
behold
us
pleading
The
poor
remainder
of
Andronici
Will
hand
in
hand
all
headlong
hurl
ourselves
And
on
the
ragged
stones
beat
forth
our
souls
And
make
a
mutual
closure
of
our
house
Speak
Romans
speak
and
if
you
say
we
shall
Lo
hand
in
hand
Lucius
and
I
will
fall
AEMILIUS
Come
come
thou
reverend
man
of
Rome
And
bring
our
Emperor
gently
in
thy
hand
Lucius
our
Emperor
for
well
I
know
The
common
voice
do
cry
it
shall
be
so
ALL
Lucius
all
hail
Rome
s
royal
Emperor
MARCUS
Go
go
into
old
Titus
sorrowful
house
And
hither
hale
that
misbelieving
Moor
To
be
adjudg
d
some
direful
slaught
ring
death
As
punishment
for
his
most
wicked
life
Exeunt
some
attendants
LUCIUS
MARCUS
and
the
others
descend
ALL
Lucius
all
hail
Rome
s
gracious
governor
LUCIUS
Thanks
gentle
Romans
May
I
govern
so
To
heal
Rome
s
harms
and
wipe
away
her
woe
But
gentle
people
give
me
aim
awhile
For
nature
puts
me
to
a
heavy
task
Stand
all
aloof
but
uncle
draw
you
near
To
shed
obsequious
tears
upon
this
trunk
O
take
this
warm
kiss
on
thy
pale
cold
lips
Kisses
TITUS
These
sorrowful
drops
upon
thy
blood
stain
d
face
The
last
true
duties
of
thy
noble
son
MARCUS
Tear
for
tear
and
loving
kiss
for
kiss
Thy
brother
Marcus
tenders
on
thy
lips
O
were
the
sum
of
these
that
I
should
pay
Countless
and
infinite
yet
would
I
pay
them
LUCIUS
Come
hither
boy
come
come
come
and
learn
of
us
To
melt
in
showers
Thy
grandsire
lov
d
thee
well
Many
a
time
he
danc
d
thee
on
his
knee
Sung
thee
asleep
his
loving
breast
thy
pillow
Many
a
story
hath
he
told
to
thee
And
bid
thee
bear
his
pretty
tales
in
mind
And
talk
of
them
when
he
was
dead
and
gone
MARCUS
How
many
thousand
times
hath
these
poor
lips
When
they
were
living
warm
d
themselves
on
thine
O
now
sweet
boy
give
them
their
latest
kiss
Bid
him
farewell
commit
him
to
the
grave
Do
them
that
kindness
and
take
leave
of
them
BOY
O
grandsire
grandsire
ev
n
with
all
my
heart
Would
I
were
dead
so
you
did
live
again
O
Lord
I
cannot
speak
to
him
for
weeping
My
tears
will
choke
me
if
I
ope
my
mouth
Re
enter
attendants
with
AARON
A
ROMAN
You
sad
Andronici
have
done
with
woes
Give
sentence
on
the
execrable
wretch
That
hath
been
breeder
of
these
dire
events
LUCIUS
Set
him
breast
deep
in
earth
and
famish
him
There
let
him
stand
and
rave
and
cry
for
food
If
any
one
relieves
or
pities
him
For
the
offence
he
dies
This
is
our
doom
Some
stay
to
see
him
fast
ned
in
the
earth
AARON
Ah
why
should
wrath
be
mute
and
fury
dumb
I
am
no
baby
I
that
with
base
prayers
I
should
repent
the
evils
I
have
done
Ten
thousand
worse
than
ever
yet
I
did
Would
I
perform
if
I
might
have
my
will
If
one
good
deed
in
all
my
life
I
did
I
do
repent
it
from
my
very
soul
LUCIUS
Some
loving
friends
convey
the
Emperor
hence
And
give
him
burial
in
his
father
s
grave
My
father
and
Lavinia
shall
forthwith
Be
closed
in
our
household
s
monument
As
for
that
ravenous
tiger
Tamora
No
funeral
rite
nor
man
in
mourning
weed
No
mournful
bell
shall
ring
her
burial
But
throw
her
forth
to
beasts
and
birds
to
prey
Her
life
was
beastly
and
devoid
of
pity
And
being
dead
let
birds
on
her
take
pity
