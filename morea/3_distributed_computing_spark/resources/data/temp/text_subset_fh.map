I
would
not
be
ambitious
in
my
wish
To
wish
myself
much
better
yet
for
you
I
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
A
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
That
only
to
stand
high
in
your
account
I
might
in
virtues
beauties
livings
friends
Exceed
account
But
the
full
sum
of
me
Is
sum
of
something
which
to
term
in
gross
Is
an
unlesson
d
girl
unschool
d
unpractis
d
Happy
in
this
she
is
not
yet
so
old
But
she
may
learn
happier
than
this
She
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learn
Happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
Commits
itself
to
yours
to
be
directed
As
from
her
lord
her
governor
her
king
Myself
and
what
is
mine
to
you
and
yours
Is
now
converted
But
now
I
was
the
lord
Of
this
fair
mansion
master
of
my
servants
Queen
o
er
myself
and
even
now
but
now
This
house
these
servants
and
this
same
myself
Are
yours
my
lord
s
I
give
them
with
this
ring
Which
when
you
part
from
lose
or
give
away
Let
it
presage
the
ruin
of
your
love
And
be
my
vantage
to
exclaim
on
you
BASSANIO
Madam
you
have
bereft
me
of
all
words
Only
my
blood
speaks
to
you
in
my
veins
And
there
is
such
confusion
in
my
powers
As
after
some
oration
fairly
spoke
By
a
beloved
prince
there
doth
appear
Among
the
buzzing
pleased
multitude
Where
every
something
being
blent
together
Turns
to
a
wild
of
nothing
save
of
joy
Express
d
and
not
express
d
But
when
this
ring
Parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
O
then
be
bold
to
say
Bassanio
s
dead
NERISSA
My
lord
and
lady
it
is
now
our

That

Good

Good

GRATIANO
My
Lord
Bassanio

I
wish

all

For
I

you
can
wish
none

And
when
your

solemnize
The
bargain
of
your

I
do
beseech
you
Even
at
that

I
may
be

For

And
swearing

With

PORTIA
There
are
some
shrewd
contents
in
yond
same
paper
That
steals
the
colour
from
Bassanio
s
cheek
Some
dear
friend
dead
else
nothing
in
the
world
Could
turn
so
much
the
constitution
Of
any
constant
man
What
worse
and
worse
With
leave
Bassanio
I
am
half
yourself
And
I
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
That
this

paper
brings
you
BASSANIO
O
sweet
Portia
Here
are
a
few
of
the
unpleasant
st
words
That
ever
blotted
paper
Gentle
lady
When
I
did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
I
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
I
had
Ran
in
my
veins
I
was
a
gentleman
And
then
I
told
you
true
And
yet
dear
lady
Rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
How
much
I
was
a
braggart
When
I
told
you
My
state
was
nothing
I
should
then
have
told
you
That
I
was
worse
than
nothing
for
indeed
I
have
engag
d
myself
to
a
dear
friend
Engag
d
my
friend
to
his
mere
enemy
To
feed
my
means
Here
is
a
letter
lady
The
paper
as
the
body
of
my
friend
And
every
word
in
it
a
gaping
wound
Issuing
life
blood
But
is
it
true
Salerio
Hath
all
his
ventures
fail
d
What
not
one
hit
From
Tripolis
from
Mexico
and
England
From
Lisbon
Barbary
and
India
And
not
one

scape
the
dreadful
touch
Of
merchant
marring
rocks
SALERIO
Not
one
my
lord
Besides
it
should
appear
that
if
he
had
The
present
money
to
discharge
the
Jew
He
would
not
take
it
Never
did
I
know
A
creature
that
did
bear
the
shape
of
man
So
keen
and
greedy
to
confound
a
man
He
plies
the
Duke
at
morning
and
at
night
And
doth
impeach
the
freedom
of
the
state
If
they
deny
him
justice
Twenty
merchants
The
Duke
himself
and
the
magnificoes
Of
greatest
port
have
all
persuaded
with
him
But
none
can
drive
him
from
the
envious
plea
Of
forfeiture
of
justice
and
his
bond
JESSICA
When
I
was
with
him
I
have
heard
him
swear
To
Tubal
and
to
Chus
his
countrymen
That
he
would
rather
have
Antonio
s
flesh
Than
twenty
times
the
value
of
the
sum
That
he
did
owe
him
and
I
know
my
lord
If
law
authority
and
power
deny
not
It
will
go
hard

poor
Antonio

In

For

First
go

And
then
away

For
never
shall
you
lie
by
Portia

With
an
unquiet
soul
You
shall
have
gold
To
pay
the
petty
debt
twenty

When

is
paid
bring
your

along
My

Nerissa

Will
live

Come

For

BASSANIO
Reads
Sweet
Bassanio
my

cruel
my

my
bond
to
the
Jew
is
forfeit
and
since
in
paying
it
it
is
impossible
I
should
live
all
debts
are
clear
d
between
you
and
I
if
I
might

see
you
at

death
Notwithstanding
use

if

not
persuade
you
to
come
let
not
my
letter
PORTIA
O
love
dispatch
all

gone
BASSANIO
Since
I
have
your
good
leave
to
go
away
I
will
make
haste

till
I

No

But
since
I

The

shall
grant

justice
I
do
wonder
Thou

fond
To

ANTONIO
I

SOLANIO
I

sure
the
Duke
Will
never

this
forfeiture
to

ANTONIO
The
Duke
cannot
deny
the
course
of
law
For
the
commodity
that
strangers
have
With
us
in
Venice
if
it
be
denied
Will
much
impeach
the
justice
of
the
state
Since

Consisteth

Therefore

These

Madam

noble

a
true
conceit
Of
godlike

appears
most
strongly
In

That

Of

bestowed
In

From

upon
me
LAUNCELOT
Truly
then
I
fear
you
are
damn
d
both
by
father
and
mother
thus
when
I
shun
Scylla
your
father
I
fall
into
Charybdis
your
mother
well
you
are
gone
both
ways
JESSICA
I
shall
be
sav
d
by
my
husband
he
hath
made
me
a
Christian
LAUNCELOT
Truly
the
more
to
blame
he
we
were
Christians
enow
before
e
en
as
many
as
could
well
live
one
by
another
This
making
of
Christians
will
raise
the
price
of
hogs
if
we
grow
all
to
be
pork
eaters
we
shall
not
shortly
have
a
rasher
on
the
coals
for
money
Enter
LORENZO
JESSICA
I
ll
tell
my
husband
Launcelot
what
you
say
here
he
comes
LORENZO
I
shall
grow
jealous
of
you
shortly
Launcelot
if
you
thus
get
my
wife
into
corners
JESSICA
Nay
you
need
nor
fear
us
Lorenzo
Launcelot
and
I
are
out
he
tells
me
flatly
there
s
no
mercy
for
me
in
heaven
because
I
am
a
Jew
s
daughter
and
he
says
you
are
no
good
member
of
the
commonwealth
for
in
converting
Jews
to
Christians
you
raise
the
price
of
pork
LORENZO
I
shall
answer
that
better
to
the
commonwealth
than
you
can
the
getting
up
of
the
negro
s
belly
the
Moor
is
with
child
by
you
Launcelot
LAUNCELOT
It
is
much
that
the
Moor
should
be
more
than
reason
but
if
she
be
less
than
an
honest
woman
she
is
indeed
more
than
I
took
her
for
LORENZO
How
every
fool
can
play
upon
the
word
I
think
the
best
grace
of
wit
will
shortly
turn
into
silence
and
discourse
grow
commendable
in
none
only
but
parrots
Go
in
sirrah
bid
them
prepare
for
dinner
LAUNCELOT
That
is
done
sir
they
have
all
stomachs
LORENZO
Goodly
Lord
what
a
wit
snapper
are
you
Then
bid
them
prepare
dinner
LAUNCELOT
That
is
done
too
sir
only
cover
is
the
word
LORENZO
Will
you
cover
then
sir
LAUNCELOT
Not
so
sir
neither
I
know
my
duty
LORENZO
Yet
more
quarrelling
with
occasion
Wilt
thou
show
the
whole
wealth
of
thy
wit
in
an
instant
I
pray
thee
understand
a
plain
man
in
his
plain
meaning
go
to
thy
fellows
bid
them
cover
the
table
serve
in
the
meat
and
we
will
come
in
to
dinner
LAUNCELOT
For
the
table
sir
it
shall
be
serv
d
in
for
the
meat
sir
it
shall
be
cover
d
for
your
coming
in
to
dinner
sir
why
let
it
be
as
humours
and
conceits
shall
govern
Exit
LORENZO
O
dear
discretion
how
his
words
are
suited
The
fool
hath
planted
in
his
memory
An
army
of
good
words
and
I
do
know
A
many
fools
that
stand
in
better
place
Garnish
d
like
him
that
for
a
tricksy
word
Defy
the
matter
How
cheer
st
thou
Jessica
And
now
good
sweet
say
thy
opinion
How
dost
thou
like
the
Lord
Bassanio
s
wife
JESSICA
Past
all
expressing
It
is
very
meet
The
Lord
Bassanio
live
an
upright
life
For
having
such
a
blessing
in
his
lady
He
finds
the
joys
of
heaven
here
on
earth
And
if
on
earth
he
do
not
merit
it
In
reason
he
should
never
come
to
heaven
Why
if
two
gods
should
play
some
heavenly
match
And
on
the
wager
lay
two
earthly
women
And
Portia
one
there
must
be
something
else
Pawn
d
with
the
other
for
the
poor
rude
world
Hath
not
her
fellow
LORENZO
Even
such
a
husband
Hast
thou
of
me
as
she
is
for
a
wife
JESSICA
Nay
but
ask
my
opinion
too
of
that
LORENZO
I
will
anon
first
let
us
go
to
dinner
JESSICA
Nay
let
me
praise
you
while
I
have
a
stomach
LORENZO
No
pray
thee
let
it
serve
for
table
talk
Then
howsome
er
thou
speak

mong
other
things
I
shall
digest

JESSICA
Well

MAGNIFICOES
ANTONIO
BASSANIO
GRATIANO
SALERIO
and
OTHERS
DUKE
OF
VENICE
What
is
Antonio
here
ANTONIO
Ready
so
please
your
Grace
DUKE
OF
VENICE
I
am
sorry
for
thee
thou
art
come
to
answer
A
stony
adversary
an
inhuman
wretch
Uncapable
of
pity
void
and
empty
From
any
dram
of
mercy
ANTONIO
I
have
heard
Your
Grace
hath
ta
en
great
pains
to
qualify
His
rigorous
course
but
since
he
stands
obdurate
And
that
no
lawful
means
can
carry
me
Out
of
his
envy
s
reach
I
do
oppose
My
patience
to
his
fury
and
am
arm
d
To
suffer
with
a
quietness
of
spirit
The
very
tyranny
and
rage
of
his
DUKE
OF
VENICE
Go
one
and
call
the
Jew
into
the
court
SALERIO
He
is
ready

door

lord
Enter
SHYLOCK
DUKE
OF
VENICE
Make
room
and
let
him
stand
before
our
face
Shylock
the
world
thinks
and
I
think
so
too
That
thou
but
leadest
this
fashion
of
thy
malice
To
the
last
hour
of
act
and
then
tis
thought
Thou
lt
show
thy
mercy
and
remorse
more
strange
Than
is
thy
strange
apparent
cruelty
And
where
thou
now
exacts
the
penalty
Which
is
a
pound
of
this
poor
merchant
s
flesh
Thou
wilt
not
only
loose
the
forfeiture
But
touch
d
with
human
gentleness
and
love
Forgive
a
moiety
of
the
principal
Glancing
an
eye
of
pity
on
his
losses
That
have
of
late
so
huddled
on
his
back
Enow
to
press
a
royal
merchant
down
And
pluck
commiseration
of
his
state
From
brassy
bosoms
and
rough
hearts
of
flint
From
stubborn
Turks
and
Tartars
never
train
d
To
offices
of
tender
courtesy
We
all
expect
a
gentle
answer
Jew
SHYLOCK
I
have
possess
d
your
Grace
of
what
I
purpose
And
by
our
holy
Sabbath
have
I
sworn
To
have
the
due
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
If
you
deny
it
let
the
danger
light
Upon
your
charter
and
your
city
s
freedom
You
ll
ask
me
why
I
rather
choose
to
have
A
weight
of
carrion
flesh
than
to
receive
Three
thousand
ducats
I
ll
not
answer
that
But
say
it
is
my
humour
is
it
answer
d
What
if
my
house
be
troubled
with
a
rat
And
I
be
pleas
d
to
give
ten
thousand
ducats
To
have
it
ban
d
What
are
you
answer
d
yet
Some
men
there
are
love
not
a
gaping
pig
Some
that
are
mad
if
they
behold
a
cat
And
others
when
the
bagpipe
sings
i
th
nose
Cannot
contain
their
urine
for
affection
Mistress
of
passion
sways
it
to
the
mood
Of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
Now
for
your
answer
As
there
is
no
firm
reason
to
be
rend
red
Why
he
cannot
abide
a
gaping
pig
Why
he
a
harmless
necessary
cat
Why
he
a
woollen
bagpipe
but
of
force
Must
yield
to
such
inevitable
shame
As
to
offend
himself
being
offended
So
can
I
give
no
reason
nor
I
will
not
More
than
a
lodg
d
hate
and
a
certain
loathing
I
bear
Antonio
that
I
follow
thus
A
losing
suit
against
him
Are
you
answered
BASSANIO
This
is
no
answer
thou
unfeeling
man
To
excuse
the
current
of
thy
cruelty
SHYLOCK
I
am
not
bound
to
please
thee
with
my
answers
BASSANIO
Do
all
men
kill
the
things
they
do
not
love
SHYLOCK
Hates
any
man
the
thing
he
would
not
kill
BASSANIO
Every
offence
is
not
a
hate
at
first
SHYLOCK
What
wouldst
thou
have
a
serpent
sting
thee
twice
ANTONIO
I
pray
you
think
you
question
with
the
Jew
You
may
as
well
go
stand
upon
the
beach
And
bid
the
main
flood
bate
his
usual
height
You
may
as
well
use
question
with
the
wolf
Why
he
hath
made
the
ewe
bleat
for
the
lamb
You
may
as
well
forbid
the
mountain
pines
To
wag
their
high
tops
and
to
make
no
noise
When
they
are
fretten
with
the
gusts
of
heaven
You
may
as
well
do
anything
most
hard
As
seek
to
soften
that
than
which
what
s
harder
His
jewish
heart
Therefore
I
do
beseech
you
Make
no
moe
offers
use
no
farther
means
But
with
all
brief
and
plain
conveniency
Let
me
have
judgment
and
the
Jew
his
will
BASSANIO
For
thy
three
thousand
ducats
here
is
six
SHYLOCK
If
every
ducat
in
six
thousand
ducats
Were
in
six
parts
and
every
part
a
ducat
I
would
not
draw
them
I
would
have
my
bond
DUKE
OF
VENICE
How
shalt
thou
hope
for
mercy
rend
ring
none
SHYLOCK
What
judgment
shall
I
dread
doing
no
wrong
You
have
among
you
many
a
purchas
d
slave
Which
fike
your
asses
and
your
dogs
and
mules
You
use
in
abject
and
in
slavish
parts
