So

Hortensio

all
her
faults
PETRUCHIO
I

Born

do
hope
good
days
and
long

GREMIO
O
Sir
such
a
life
with
such
a

were
strange
But
if
you

a
stomach
to
t
a
God
s
name
You

have
me
assisting
you
in
all
But

wild
cat
PETRUCHIO
Will

live
GRUMIO
Will
he
woo
her
Ay
or
I
ll
hang

PETRUCHIO
Why
came
I
hither
but
to
that
intent
Think
you
a
little
din
can
daunt
mine
ears
Have
I
not
in
my
time
heard
lions
roar
Have
I
not
heard
the
sea
puff
d
up
with
winds
Rage
like
an
angry
boar
chafed
with
sweat
Have
I
not
heard
great
ordnance
in
the
field
And
heaven
s
artillery
thunder
in
the
skies
Have
I
not
in
a
pitched
battle
heard
Loud
larums
neighing
steeds
and
trumpets
clang
And
do
you
tell
me
of
a
woman
s
tongue
That
gives
not
half
so
great
a
blow
to
hear
As
will
a
chestnut
in
a
fariner
s
fire
Tush
tush
fear
boys
with
bugs
GRUMIO
For
he
fears
none
GREMIO
Hortensio

This
gentleman

My

of

For

for
you
GREMIO
But

she
TRANIO
For
what
reason
I

GREMIO
For
this
reason
if

That

the
choice
love
of
Signior
Gremio

chosen
of

Baptista

noble
gentleman
To

my
father

She

more
suitors

Fair
Leda

thousand

one
more

to

gentleman

all
LUCENTIO
Sir
give

a
jade
PETRUCHIO
Hortensio

what
end
are
all
these
words
HORTENSIO
Sir
let
me
be
so
bold
as
ask
you
Did
you
yet
ever
see
Baptista
s
daughter
TRANIO
No
sir
but
hear
I
do
that
he
hath
two
The
one
as
famous
for
a
scolding
tongue
As
is
the
other
for
beauteous
modesty
PETRUCHIO
Sir
sir
the
first
s
for
me
let
her
go
by
GREMIO
Yea
leave
that
labour
to
great
Hercules
And

be
more
than
Alcides
twelve
PETRUCHIO
Sir
understand
you
this
of
me
in
sooth
The
youngest
daughter
whom
you
hearken
for
Her
father
keeps
from
all
access
of
suitors
And
will
not
promise
her
to
any
man
Until
the
elder
sister
first
be
wed
The
younger
then
is
free
and
not
before
TRANIO
If
it
be
so
sir
that
you
are
the
man
Must
stead
us
all
and
me
amongst
the
rest
And
if
you
break
the
ice
and
do
this
feat
Achieve
the
elder
set
the
younger
free
For
our
access
whose
hap
shall
be
to
have
her
Will
not
so
graceless
be
to
be
ingrate
HORTENSIO
Sir
you
say
well
and
well
you
do
conceive
And
since
you
do
profess
to
be
a
suitor
You
must
as
we
do
gratify
this
gentleman
To
whom
we
all
rest
generally
beholding
TRANIO
Sir
I
shall
not
be
slack
in
sign
whereof
Please

we
may

afternoon
And

Strive

grateful

am
sure
of
it
To
express
the
like
kindness
myself
that
have
been
more
kindly
beholding
to
you
than

unto

this
young
scholar

Pardon

That
being
a
stranger
in
this
city
here
Do
make
myself
a
suitor
to
your
daughter
Unto
Bianca
fair
and
virtuous
Nor
is
your
firm
resolve
unknown
to
me
In
the
preferment
of
the
eldest
sister
This
liberty
is
all
that
I
request
That
upon
knowledge
of
my
parentage
I
may
have
welcome
mongst
the
rest
that
woo
And
free
access
and
favour
as
the
rest
And
toward
the
education
of
your
daughters
I
here
bestow
a
simple
instrument
And
this
small
packet
of
Greek
and
Latin
books

their
worth
is
great

the
books
We
will
go
walk
a
little
in
the
orchard
And
then
to
dinner
You
are
passing
welcome
And
so
I
pray
you
all
to
think
yourselves
PETRUCHIO
Signior
Baptista
my
business
asketh
haste
And
every
day
I
cannot
come
to
woo
You
knew
my
father
well
and
in
him
me
Left
solely
heir
to
all
his
lands
and
goods
Which
I
have
bettered
rather
than
decreas
d
Then
tell
me
if
I
get
your
daughter
s
love
What
dowry
shall
I
have
with
her
to
wife
BAPTISTA
After
my
death
the
one
half
of
my
lands
And
in
possession
twenty
thousand
crowns
PETRUCHIO
And
for
that
dowry
I
ll
assure
her
of
Her
widowhood
be
it
that
she
survive
me
In
all
my
lands
and
leases
whatsoever
Let
specialities
be
therefore
drawn
between
us
That
covenants
may
be
kept
on
either
hand
BAPTISTA
Ay
when
the
special
thing
is
well
obtain
d
That
is
her
love
for
that
is
all
in
all
PETRUCHIO
Why
that
is
nothing
for
I
tell
you
father
I
am
as
peremptory
as
she
proud
minded
And
where
two
raging
fires
meet
together
They
do
consume
the
thing
that
feeds
their
fury
Though
little
fire
grows
great
with
little
wind
Yet
extreme
gusts
will
blow
out
fire
and
all
So
I
to
her
and
so
she
yields
to
me
For
I
am
rough
and
woo
not
like
a
babe
BAPTISTA
Well
mayst
thou
woo
and
happy
be
thy
speed
But
be
thou
arm
d
for
some
unhappy
words
PETRUCHIO
Ay
to
the
proof
as
mountains
are
for
winds
That
shake
not
though
they
blow
perpetually
Re
enter
HORTENSIO
with
his
head
broke
BAPTISTA
How
now
my
friend
Why
dost
thou
look
so
pale
HORTENSIO
For
fear
I
promise
you
if
I
look
pale
BAPTISTA
What
will
my
daughter
prove
a
good
musician
HORTENSIO
I
think
she
ll
sooner
prove
a
soldier
Iron
may
hold
with
her
but
never
lutes
BAPTISTA
Why
then
thou
canst
not
break
her
to
the
lute
HORTENSIO
Why
no
for
she
hath
broke
the
lute
to
me
I
did
but
tell
her
she
mistook
her
frets
And
bow
d
her
hand
to
teach
her
fingering
When
with
a
most
impatient
devilish
spirit
Frets
call
you
these
quoth
she
I
ll
fume
with
them
And
with
that
word
she
struck
me
on
the
head
And
through
the
instrument
my
pate
made
way
And
there
I
stood
amazed
for
a
while
As
on
a
pillory
looking
through
the
lute
While
she
did
call
me
rascal
fiddler
And
twangling
Jack
with
twenty
such
vile
terms
As
she
had
studied
to
misuse
me
so
PETRUCHIO
Now
by
the
world
it
is
a
lusty
wench
I
love
her
ten
times
more
than
e
er
I
did
O
how
I
long
to
have
some
chat
with
her
BAPTISTA
Well
go
with
me
and
be
not
so
discomfited
Proceed
in
practice
with
my
younger
daughter
She
s
apt
to
learn
and
thankful
for
good
turns
Signior
Petruchio
will
you
go
with
us
Or
shall
I
send
my
daughter
Kate
to
you
PETRUCHIO
I
pray
you
do
Exeunt
all
but
PETRUCHIO
I
ll
attend
her
here
And
woo
her
with
some
spirit
when
she
comes
Say
that
she
rail
why
then
I
ll
tell
her
plain
She
sings
as
sweetly
as
a
nightingale
Say
that
she
frown
I
ll
say
she
looks
as
clear
As
morning
roses
newly
wash
d
with
dew
Say
she
be
mute
and
will
not
speak
a
word
Then
I
ll
commend
her
volubility
And
say
she
uttereth
piercing
eloquence
If
she
do
bid
me
pack
I
ll
give
her
thanks
As
though
she
bid
me
stay
by
her
a
week
If
she
deny
to
wed
I
ll
crave
the
day
When
I
shall
ask
the
banns
and
when
be
married
But
here
she
comes
Lnd

Good

hard
of
hearing
They

PETRUCHIO
You

faith
for

And

Christendom

Hall
my
super
dainty
Kate
For
dainties

all
Kates
and
therefore
Kate
Take
this
of
me
Kate
of
my
consolation
Hearing
thy
mildness
prais
d
in
every
town
Thy
virtues
spoke
of
and
thy
beauty
sounded
Yet
not
so
deeply
as
to
thee
belongs
Myself
am
mov
d
to
woo
thee
for
my
wife
KATHERINA
Mov
d
in
good
time
Let
him
that
mov
d
you

Remove
you
hence
I
knew
you
at
the
first
You
were
a
moveable
PETRUCHIO
Why

s
a
moveable
KATHERINA
A
join
d
stool
PETRUCHIO
Thou
hast
hit
it
Come
sit
on
me
KATHERINA
Asses
are
made
to
bear
and
so
are
you
PETRUCHIO
Women
are
made
to
bear
and
so
are
you
KATHERINA
No
such
jade
as
you
if
me
you
mean
PETRUCHIO
Alas
good
Kate
I
will
not
burden
thee
For
knowing
thee
to
be
but
young
and
light
KATHERINA
Too
light
for
such
a
swain
as
you
to
catch
And
yet
as
heavy
as
my
weight
should
be
PETRUCHIO
Should
be
should
buzz
KATHERINA
Well

en
and
like
a
buzzard
PETRUCHIO
O
slow
wing
d
turtle
shall
a
buzzard
take
thee
KATHERINA
Ay

a
turtle
as
he
takes
a
buzzard
PETRUCHIO
Come
come
you
wasp
i
faith
you
are
too
angry
KATHERINA
If
I
be
waspish
best
beware
my
sting
PETRUCHIO
My
remedy
is
then
to
pluck
it
out
KATHERINA
Ay
if
the
fool
could
find
it
where
it
lies
PETRUCHIO
Who
knows
not
where
a
wasp
does
wear
his
sting
In
his
tail
KATHERINA
In
his
tongue
PETRUCHIO
Whose
tongue
KATHERINA
Yours
if
you
talk
of
tales
and
so
farewell
PETRUCHIO
What
with
my
tongue
in
your
tail
Nay
come
again
Good
Kate
I
am
a
gentleman
KATHERINA
That
I
ll
try
She
strikes
him
PETRUCHIO
I
swear
I
ll
cuff
you
if
you
strike
again
KATHERINA
So
may
you
lose
your
arms
If
you
strike
me
you
are
no
gentleman
And
if
no
gentleman
why
then
no
arms
PETRUCHIO
A
herald
Kate
O
put
me
in
thy
books
KATHERINA
What
is
your
crest
a
coxcomb
PETRUCHIO
A
combless
cock
so
Kate
will
be
my
hen
KATHERINA
No
cock
of
mine
you
crow
too
like
a
craven
PETRUCHIO
Nay
come
Kate
come
you
must
not
look
so
sour
KATHERINA
It
is
my
fashion
when
I
see
a
crab
PETRUCHIO
Why
here
s
no
crab
and
therefore
look
not
sour
KATHERINA
There
is
there
is
PETRUCHIO
Then
show
it
me
KATHERINA
Had
I
a
glass
I
would
PETRUCHIO
What
you
mean
my
face
KATHERINA
Well
aim
d
of
such
a
young
one
PETRUCHIO
Now
by
Saint
George
I
am
too
young
for
you
KATHERINA
Yet
you
are
wither
d
PETRUCHIO
Tis
with
cares
KATHERINA
I
care
not
PETRUCHIO
Nay
hear
you
Kate
in
sooth
you
scape
not
so
KATHERINA
I
chafe
you
if
I
tarry
let
me
go
PETRUCHIO
No
not
a
whit
I
find
you
passing
gentle
Twas
told
me
you
were
rough
and
coy
and
sullen
And
now
I
find
report
a
very
liar
For
thou
art
pleasant
gamesome
passing
courteous
But
slow
in
speech
yet
sweet
as
springtime
flowers
Thou
canst
not
frown
thou
canst
not
look
askance
Nor
bite
the
lip
as
angry
wenches
will
Nor
hast
thou
pleasure
to
be
cross
in
talk
But
thou
with
mildness
entertain
st
thy
wooers
With
gentle
conference
soft
and
affable
Why
does
the
world
report
that
Kate
doth
limp
O
sland
rous
world
Kate
like
the
hazel
twig
Is
straight
and
slender
and
as
brown
in
hue
As
hazel
nuts
and
sweeter
than
the
kernels
O
let
me
see
thee
walk
Thou
dost
not
halt
KATHERINA
Go
fool
and
whom
thou
keep
st
command
PETRUCHIO
Did
ever
Dian
so
become
a
grove
As
Kate
this
chamber
with
her
princely
gait
O
be
thou
Dian
and
let
her
be
Kate
And
then
let
Kate
be
chaste
and
Dian
sportful
KATHERINA
Where
did
you
study
all
this
goodly
speech
PETRUCHIO
It
is
extempore
from
my
mother
wit
KATHERINA
A
witty
mother
witless
else
her
son
PETRUCHIO
Am
I
not
wise
KATHERINA
Yes
keep
you
warm
PETRUCHIO
Marry
so
I
mean
sweet
Katherine
in
thy
bed
And
therefore
setting
all
this
chat
aside
Thus
in
plain
terms
your
father
hath
consented
That
you
shall
be
my
wife
your
dowry
greed
on
And
will
you
nill
you
I
will
marry
you
Now
Kate
I
am
a
husband
for
your
turn
For
by
this
light
whereby
I
see
thy
beauty
Thy
beauty
that
doth
make
me
like
thee
well
Thou
must
be
married
to
no
man
but
me
For
I
am
he

born
to
tame
you
Kate
And
bring
you
from
a
wild
Kate
to

for
policy
For

the
dove
She
is
not
hot
but
temperate
as
the
morn
For
patience
she
will
prove
a
second
Grissel
And
Roman
Lucrece
for
her
chastity
And
to
conclude

greed
so
well
together
