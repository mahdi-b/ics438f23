DROMIO

Marry

such

and
she
would
have
me
as
a

not
that
I
being

lays
claim
to

ANTIPHOLUS

What

DROMIO

A

marriage
DROMIO

Marry

she

wench
and
all

and
I

to
make
a
lamp
of
her
and
run
from
her
by
her

I
warrant
her
rags
and
the

in

If

Swart

No

DROMIO

in

I
found
it
by

Where
England

I
look
d
for
the
chalky
cliffs
but
I
could
find
no

I
guess
it
stood
in
her
chin
by
the
salt
rheum
that
ran
between
France
and
it
ANTIPHOLUS
OF

Where
Spain
DROMIO

Faith
I
saw

I
felt

O

breath
of

sent

to

at

ANTIPHOLUS

Where

DROMIO

O

I
did
not
look
so
low
To

this
drudge

laid
claim

I
was
assur

what
privy
marks
I
had
about
me
as
the
mark
of
my
shoulder
the
mole
in
my
neck
the
great
wart
on
my
left
arm
that
I
amaz

ran
from
her
as
a

And
I
think
if
my
breast
had
not
been
made
of
faith
and
my
heart
of
steel
She
had
transform
d
me
to
a

Go

An
if

I
will
not

town
to
night
If
any
bark
put
forth
come
to
the
mart
Where
I
will
walk
till
thou
return
to
me
If
every
one
knows
us
and
we
know
none
Tis
time
I
think
to
trudge
pack
and
be
gone
DROMIO
OF

As
from
a
bear
a
man
would
run
for

So
fly

be
my
wife
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS

There

none

witches

high
time
that
I
were
hence
She
that
doth
call
me
husband
even
my
soul
Doth
for
a
wife
abhor
But
her
fair
sister
Possess
d
with
such
a
gentle
sovereign
grace
Of
such
enchanting
presence
and
discourse
Hath
almost
made
me
traitor
to
myself
But
lest
myself
be
guilty
to
self
wrong
I
ll
stop
mine
ears
against
the
mermaid

Porpentine
The

That

by

When
in

meets
such
golden

I
do
owe

Is
growing

by
Antipholus
And
in
the
instant
that
I
met
with

He

Among

I
promised
your

and
the
chain
But
neither
chain

Belike
you
thought
our
love
would
last
too
long
If
it
were
chain
d
together
and
therefore
came
not
ANGELO
Saving
your
merry
humour
here
s
the
note
How
much
your
chain
weighs
to
the
utmost
carat
The
fineness
of
the
gold
and
chargeful
fashion
Which
doth
amount
to
three
odd
ducats
more
Than
I
stand
debted
to
this
gentleman
I
pray
you
see
him
presently
discharg
d
For

And

Disburse

thereof
Perchance
I

ANGELO
Then
you
will
bring
the
chain
to

ANTIPHOLUS

ANTIPHOLUS
OF
EPHESUS
Good
Lord

use
this
dalliance
to
excuse
Your
breach
of
promise
to

Porpentine
I

have
chid
you
for

Either

some
token

swore
he
that
he
was
a
stranger
here
ADRIANA
And
true
he
swore
though
yet
forsworn
he
were
LUCIANA
Then
pleaded
I
for
you
ADRIANA
And
what
said
he
LUCIANA
That
love
I
begg

for
you
he
begg

of

ADRIANA
With
what
persuasion
did
he
tempt
thy
love
LUCIANA
With
words
that
in
an
honest
suit
might
move
First
he
did
praise
my
beauty
then
my
speech
ADRIANA
Didst
speak
him
fair
LUCIANA
Have
patience
I
beseech
ADRIANA
I
cannot
nor
I
will
not
hold
me
still
My
tongue
though
not
my
heart
shall
have
his
will
He
is
deformed
crooked
old
and
sere
Ill
fac

worse
bodied
shapeless
everywhere
Vicious
ungentle
foolish
blunt
unkind
Stigmatical
in
making

LUCIANA
Who
would
be
jealous
then
of
such
a
one
No

lost

ADRIANA
Ah
but
I
think
him
better
than
I
say
And
yet
would
herein
others

Far

How

thou
lost

DROMIO

By

ADRIANA
Where
is
thy
master
Dromio
Is
he
well
DROMIO
OF
SYRACUSE
No
he
s
in
Tartar
limbo
worse
than
hell
A
devil
in
an
everlasting
garment
hath
him
One
whose
hard
heart
is
button
d
up
with
steel
A
fiend
a
fairy
pitiless
and
rough
A
wolf
nay
worse
a
fellow
all
in
buff
A
back
friend
a
shoulder
clapper
one
that
countermands
The
passages
of
alleys
creeks
and
narrow
lands
A
hound
that
runs
counter
and
yet
draws
dry
foot
well
One
that
before
the
Judgment
carries
poor
souls
to
hell
ADRIANA
Why

DROMIO

I

DROMIO

I

But

I
tell
Will

ADRIANA
Go
fetch
it
sister
Exit
LUCIANA
This
I
wonder
at
Thus

Tell
me
was

arrested
on
a
band
DROMIO
OF
SYRACUSE
on
a
band
but
on
a
stronger
thing
A
chain

Do

ADRIANA
What

chain
DROMIO

No

O

If

How

DROMIO
OF

Time

bankrupt

owes
more

Nay
he

a
thief
too
have
you
not
heard
men
say
That
Time
comes
stealing
on
by
night
and

If

Now
out
of

Antipholus

mad
Else
would
he
never

demean
himself
A
ring
he
hath
of
mine
worth
forty
ducats
And
for
the
same
he
promis
d
me
a
chain
Both
one
and
other
he
denies
me
now
The
reason
that
I
gather
he
is
mad
Besides
this
present
instance
of
his
rage
Is
a
mad
tale
he
told
to
day
at
dinner
Of
his
own
doors
being
shut
against
his
entrance
Belike
his
wife
acquainted
with
his
fits
On
purpose
shut
the
doors
against
his

My
way
is
now
to
hie
home
to
his
house
And
tell
his
wife
that
being
lunatic
He
rush
d
into
my
house
and
took
perforce
My
ring
away
This
course
I
fittest
choose
For
forty
ducats
is
too
much
to
lose
