KING
HENRY
And
otherwise
will
Henry
ne
er
presume
Therefore
my
Lord
Protector
give
consent
That
Margaret
may
be
England
s
royal
Queen
GLOUCESTER
So
should
I
give
consent
to
flatter
sin
You
know
my
lord
your
Highness
is
betroth
d
Unto
another
lady
of
esteem
How
shall
we
then
dispense
with
that
contract
And
not
deface
your
honour
with
reproach
SUFFOLK
As
doth
a
ruler
with
unlawful
oaths
Or
one
that
at
a
triumph
having
vow
d
To
try
his
strength
forsaketh
yet
the
lists
By
reason
of
his
adversary
s
odds
A
poor
earl
s
daughter
is
unequal
odds
And
therefore
may
be
broke
without
offence
GLOUCESTER
Why
what
I
pray
is
Margaret
more
than
that
Her
father
is
no
better
than
an
earl
Although
in
glorious
titles
he
excel
SUFFOLK
Yes
my
lord
her
father
is
a
king
The
King
of
Naples
and
Jerusalem
And
of
such
great
authority
in
France
As
his
alliance
will
confirm
our
peace
And
keep
the
Frenchmen
in
allegiance
GLOUCESTER
And
so
the
Earl
of
Armagnac
may
do
Because
he
is
near
kinsman
unto
Charles
EXETER
Beside
his
wealth
doth
warrant
a
liberal
dower
Where
Reignier
sooner
will
receive
than
give
SUFFOLK
A
dow
r
my
lords
Disgrace
not
so
your
king
That
he
should
be
so
abject
base
and
poor
To
choose
for
wealth
and
not
for
perfect
love
Henry
is
able
to
enrich
his
queen
And
not
to
seek
a
queen
to
make
him
rich
So
worthless
peasants
bargain
for
their
wives
As
market
men
for
oxen
sheep
or
horse
Marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
Than
to
be
dealt
in
by
attorneyship
Not
whom
we
will
but
whom
his
Grace
affects
Must
be
companion
of
his
nuptial
bed
And
therefore
lords
since
he
affects
her
most
It
most
of
all
these
reasons
bindeth
us
In
our
opinions
she
should
be
preferr
d
For
what
is
wedlock
forced
but
a
hell
An
age
of
discord
and
continual
strife
Whereas
the
contrary
bringeth
bliss
And
is
a
pattern
of
celestial
peace
Whom
should
we
match
with
Henry
being
a
king
But
Margaret
that
is
daughter
to
a
king
Her
peerless
feature
joined
with
her
birth
Approves
her
fit
for
none
but
for
a
king
Her
valiant
courage
and
undaunted
spirit
More
than
in
women
commonly
is
seen
Will
answer
our
hope
in
issue
of
a
king
For
Henry
son
unto
a
conqueror
Is
likely
to
beget
more
conquerors
If
with
a
lady
of
so
high
resolve
As
is
fair
Margaret
he
be
link
d
in
love
Then
yield
my
lords
and
here
conclude
with
me
That
Margaret
shall
be
Queen
and
none
but
she
KING
HENRY
Whether
it
be
through
force
of
your
report
My
noble
Lord
of
Suffolk
or
for
that
My
tender
youth
was
never
yet
attaint
With
any
passion
of
inflaming
love
I
cannot
tell
but
this
I
am
assur
d
I
feel
such
sharp
dissension
in
my
breast
Such
fierce
alarums
both
of
hope
and
fear
As
I
am
sick
with
working
of
my
thoughts
Take
therefore
shipping
post
my
lord
to
France
Agree
to
any
covenants
and
procure
That
Lady
Margaret
do
vouchsafe
to
come
To
cross
the
seas
to
England
and
be
crown
d
King
Henry
s
faithful
and
anointed
queen
For
your
expenses
and
sufficient
charge
Among
the
people
gather
up
a
tenth
Be
gone
I
say
for
till
you
do
return
I
rest
perplexed
with
a
thousand
cares
And
you
good
uncle
banish
all
offence
If
you
do
censure
me
by
what
you
were
Not
what
you
are
I
know
it
will
excuse
This
sudden
execution
of
my
will
And
so
conduct
me
where
from
company
I
may
revolve
and
ruminate
my
grief
Exit
GLOUCESTER
Ay
grief
I
fear
me
both
at
first
and
last
Exeunt
GLOUCESTER
and
EXETER
SUFFOLK
Thus
Suffolk
hath
prevail
d
and
thus
he
goes
As
did
the
youthful
Paris
once
to
Greece
With
hope
to
find
the
like
event
in
love
But
prosper
better
than
the
Troyan
did
Margaret
shall
now
be
Queen
and
rule
the
King
But
I
will
rule
both
her
the
King
and
realm

enemy
Nay

And

I

Consider
lords
he
is

apparent

crown
Had
Henry
got
an
empire
by
his

And

kingdoms
of

There
s
reason
he
should
be
displeas
d
at

Look
to
it
lords
let
not
his
smoothing
words
Bewitch
your
hearts
be
wise
and
circumspect
What
though
the
common
people
favour
him
Calling
him
Humphrey
the
good
Duke
of
Gloucester
Clapping
their
hands
and
crying

Jesu
maintain
your
royal
excellence
With
God

Humphrey
I
fear
me
lords
for
all
this
flattering
gloss

presently
Exit
SOMERSET
Cousin
of
Buckingham
though
Humphrey
s
pride
And
greatness
of
his
place
be
grief
to
us
Yet
let
us
watch
the
haughty
cardinal
His
insolence
is
more
intolerable
Than
all
the
princes
in
the
land
beside
If
Gloucester
be
displac

he
ll
be

BUCKINGHAM
Or
thou

SALISBURY
Pride

While
these

Behoves
it
us
to
labour
for
the
realm
I
never
saw
but
Humphrey
Duke
of
Gloucester
Did
bear
him
like
a
noble
gentleman
Oft
have
I
seen
the
haughty
Cardinal
More
like
a
soldier
than
a
man
o
th
church
As
stout
and
proud
as
he
were
lord
of
all
Swear
like
a
ruffian
and
demean
himself
Unlike
the
ruler
of
a
commonweal
Warwick
my
son
the
comfort
of
my
age
Thy
deeds
thy
plainness
and
thy

Excepting

Duke
Humphrey
And

thy
acts

In

Thy

When
thou
wert
Regent
for

sovereign
Have
made
thee
fear

and
honour
d
of
the
people
Join
we
together
for
the
public
good
In
what
we
can
to
bridle
and
suppress
The
pride
of
Suffolk
and
the
Cardinal
With
Somerset

and
Buckingham
s
ambition
And
as
we
may
cherish
Duke
Humphrey
s
deeds
While
they
do
tend

WARWICK
So
God
help
Warwick
as
he
loves
the
land
And
common
profit
of
his
country
YORK
And
so
says
York
Aside
for

hath

SALISBURY
Then
let
s
make
haste
away
and
look
unto
the
main
WARWICK
Unto
the
main
O
father
Maine
is
lost
That
Maine
which
by
main
force
Warwick
did
win
And
would
have
kept
so
long
as
breath
did
last
Main
chance
father
you
meant
but
I
meant
Maine
Which
I
will
win
from
France
or
else
be
slain
Exeunt
WARWICK
and
SALISBURY
YORK
Anjou

French
Paris

lost
the
state
of
Normandy
Stands
on

point
now
they
are
gone
Suffolk

articles
The

Henry

pleas

To
changes
two
dukedoms
for
a
duke
s
fair
daughter
I
cannot
blame
them
all
what
is
t
to
them
Tis
thine
they
give
away
and
not
their
own
Pirates
may
make
cheap
pennyworths
of
their
pillage
And
purchase
friends
and
give
to
courtezans
Still
revelling
like
lords
till
all
be
gone
While
as
the
silly
owner
of
the
goods
Weeps
over
them
and
wrings
his
hapless
hands
And
shakes
his
head
and
trembling
stands
aloof
While
all
is
shar
d
and
all
is
borne
away
Ready
to
starve
and
dare
not
touch
his
own
So
York
must
sit
and
fret
and
bite
his
tongue
While
his
own
lands
are
bargain
d
for
and
sold
Methinks
the
realms
of
England
France
and
Ireland
Bear
that
proportion
to
my
flesh
and
blood
As
did
the
fatal
brand
Althaea
burnt
Unto
the
prince
s
heart
of
Calydon
Anjou
and
Maine
both
given
unto
the
French
Cold
news
for
me
for
I
had
hope
of
France
Even
as
I
have
of
fertile
England
s
soil
A
day
will
come
when
York
shall
claim
his
own
And
therefore
I
will
take
the
Nevils
parts
And
make
a
show
of
love
to
proud
Duke
Humphrey
And
when
I
spy
advantage
claim
the
crown
For
that
s
the
golden
mark
I
seek
to
hit
Nor
shall
proud
Lancaster
usurp
my
right
Nor
hold
the
sceptre
in
his
childish
fist
Nor
wear
the
diadem
upon
his
head
Whose
church
like
humours
fits
not
for
a
crown
Then
York
be
still
awhile
till
time
do
serve
Watch
thou
and
wake
when
others
be
asleep
To
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the
state
Till
Henry
surfeiting
in
joys
of
love
With
his
new
bride
and
England
s
dear
bought
queen
And
Humphrey
with
the
peers
be
fall

Then
will
I
raise
aloft
the
milk
white
rose
With
whose
sweet
smell
the
air
shall
be
perfum
d
And
in
my
standard
bear
the
arms
of
York
To
grapple
with
the
house
of

And

I

ELEANOR
DUCHESS
Why
droops
my
lord
like
over

d
corn
Hanging
the
head
at
Ceres
plenteous
load
Why
doth
the
great
Duke
Humphrey
knit
his
brows
As
frowning
at
the
favours
of
the
world
Why
are
thine
eyes
fix
d
to
the
sullen
earth
Gazing
on
that
which
seems
to
dim
thy
sight
What
see
st
thou

King
Henry
s
diadem
Enchas

with
all
the
honours
of

If
so
gaze

on

Until

circled
with

same
Put
forth
thy
hand

at
the
glorious
gold
What
is
t
too
short
I
ll
lengthen
it
with
mine
And
having
both
together
heav
d
it
up
We
ll
both
together
lift
our
heads
to

And
never
more
abase
our

so
low
As
to
vouchsafe
one
glance

GLOUCESTER
O
Nell
sweet
Nell
if
thou
dost
love
thy
lord
Banish
the
canker
of
ambitious
thoughts
And
may
that
thought
when
I
imagine
ill
Against
my
king
and
nephew
virtuous
Henry
Be
my
last
breathing
in
this
mortal

My
troublous
dreams
this
night
doth
make

sad
DUCHESS
What
dream
d
my
lord
Tell
me
and
I
ll
requite
it
With
sweet
rehearsal
of
my
morning
s
dream
GLOUCESTER
Methought
this
staff
mine
office
badge
in
court
Was
broke
in
twain
by
whom
I
have
forgot
But
as
I
think
it
was
by
th
Cardinal
And
on
the
pieces
of
the
broken
wand
Were
plac
d
the
heads
of
Edmund
Duke
of
Somerset
And
William
de
la
Pole
first
Duke
of
Suffolk
This
was
my
dream
what
it
doth
bode
God
knows
DUCHESS
Tut
this
was
nothing
but
an
argument
That
he
that
breaks
a
stick
of
Gloucester
s
grove
Shall
lose
his
head
for
his
presumption
But
list
to
me

In

Westminster
And
in

chair
where
kings
and

were

From
