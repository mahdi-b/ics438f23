continued
Where
valiant

REIGNIER
My

ALENCON
Doubtless

shrives
this

Else
ne

could

protract
his

REIGNIER
Shall

disturb
him
since

ALENCON
He
may
mean

These

My

This

Expect

halcyon
days
Since
I
have
entered
into

Glory
is
like
a
circle
in
the
water
Which
never
ceaseth
to
enlarge
itself
Till
by
broad
spreading
it
disperse
to
nought
With
Henry
s
death
the
English
circle
ends
Dispersed
are
the
glories
it
included
Now
am
I
like
that
proud
insulting
ship
Which
Caesar
and
his
fortune
bare
at
once
CHARLES
Was
Mahomet
inspired
with
a

Thou
with

Constantine
Nor

Saint

Bright

How

ALENCON
Leave
