What
speech
my
good
lord
Ham
I
heard
thee
speak
me
a
speech
once
but
it
was
never
acted
or
if
it
was
not
above
once
for
the
play
I
remember
pleas
d
not
the
million
twas
caviary
to
the
general
but
it
was
as
I
receiv
d
it
and
others
whose
judgments
in
such
matters
cried
in
the
top
of
mine
an
excellent
play
well
digested
in
the
scenes
set
down
with
as
much
modesty
as
cunning
I
remember
one
said
there
were
no
sallets
in
the
lines
to
make
the
matter
savoury
nor
no
matter
in
the
phrase
that
might
indict
the
author
of
affectation
but
call
d
it
an
honest
method
as
wholesome
as
sweet
and
by
very
much
more
handsome
than
fine
One
speech
in
t
I
chiefly
lov
d
Twas
AEneas
tale
to
Dido
and
thereabout
of
it
especially
where
he
speaks
of
Priam
s
slaughter
If
it
live
in
your
memory
begin
at
this
line
let
me
see
let
me
see
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
like
th
Hyrcanian
beast
Tis
not
so
it
begins
with
Pyrrhus
The
rugged
Pyrrhus
he
whose
sable
arms
Black
as
his
purpose
did
the
night
resemble
When
he
lay
couched
in
the
ominous
horse
Hath
now
this
dread
and
black
complexion
smear
d
With
heraldry
more
dismal
Head
to
foot
Now
is
be
total
gules
horridly
trick

With
blood
of
fathers
mothers

Bak
d

impasted
with
the
parching
streets
That
lend
a
tyrannous
and
a
damned
light
To
their
lord
s
murther
Roasted
in
wrath
and
fire
And
thus
o
ersized
with
coagulate
gore
With
eyes
like
carbuncles
the
hellish
Pyrrhus
Old
grandsire
Priam
seeks
So
proceed
you

discretion

him
Striking

His

Rebellious

Unequal

But
with

Stoops

So
as

Pyrrhus
stood
And
like

neutral
to
his

Did
nothing
But
as
we
often
see
against
some
storm
A
silence

The
bold

speechless

As

rend

Aroused

sets

On

With

Queen
Polonius
Ophelia
Rosencrantz
Guildenstern
and
Lords
King
And
can
you
by
no
drift
of
circumstance
Get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
Grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
With
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
Ros
He
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
But
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
Guil
Nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
But
with
a
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
When
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
Of
his
true
state

receive
you
well

Most
like
a
gentleman

But
with
much
forcing

of

Most
free

Did
you
assay
him
To
any
pastime
Ros
Madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
We
o
erraught
on
the
way
Of
these
we
told
him
And
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
To
hear
of
it
They
are
here
about
the
court
And
as
I
think
they
have
already
order
This
night
to
play
before
him
Pol
Tis
most
true
And
he
beseech
d
me
to
entreat
your
Majesties
To
hear
and
see
the
matter
King
With
all
my
heart
and
it
doth
much
content
me
To
hear
him
so
inclin

Good
gentlemen
give
him
a
further
edge
And
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights

We

Exeunt

Sweet

espials
Will
so
bestow

We

frankly

To
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
Whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
The
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
Or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
And
by
opposing
end
them
To
die
to
sleep
No
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
The
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
That
flesh
is
heir
to

a
consummation
Devoutly
to
be

d
To
die

sleep
To
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
there
s
the
rub
For
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
When
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
Must
give
us
pause
There
s
the
respect
That
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
For
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
Th
oppressor
s
wrong
the
proud
man
s
contumely
The
pangs
of
despis
d
love
the
law
s
delay
The
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
That
patient
merit
of
th
unworthy
takes
When
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
With
a
bare
bodkin
Who
would
these
fardels
bear
To
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
But
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
The
undiscover
d
country
from
whose
bourn
No
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
And
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
Than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
Thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
And
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
Is
sicklied
o
er
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
And
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
With
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
And

What
means
your
lordship
Ham
That
if
you
be
honest
and
fair
your
honesty
should
admit
no
discourse
to
your
beauty
Oph
Could
beauty
my
lord
have
better
commerce
than
with
honesty
Ham
Ay
truly
for
the
power
of
beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty
can
translate
beauty
into
his
likeness
This
was
sometime
a
paradox
but
now
the
time
gives
it
proof
I
did
love
you
once
Oph
Indeed
my
lord
you
made
me
believe
so

You
should
not
have
believ

inoculate

deceived

Get

Why
wouldst
thou
be
a
breeder
of
sinners
I
am
myself
indifferent
honest
but
yet
I
could
accuse
me
of
such
things
that
it
were
better
my
mother

not
borne
me
I
am
very
proud
revengeful
ambitious

Farewell

If

chaste

pure

Get

Go

Or
if

marry

what
monsters

them
To

go
and
quickly
too
Farewell

O
heavenly
powers
restore
him
Ham
I
have
heard
of
your
paintings
too
well
enough
God
hath
given
you
one
face
and
you
make
yourselves
another
You

and
you

you

creatures
and
make
your
wantonness
your
ignorance
Go

no

no

Those

already

live
the
rest

To

Exit

O
what
a
noble
mind
is
here
o
erthrown
The
courtier

soldier
s
eye

Th
expectancy
and
rose
of
the
fair
state
The
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
Th
observ
d
of
all
observers
quite
quite
down
And
I
of
ladies
most
deject
and
wretched
That
suck
d
the
honey
of
his
music
vows
Now
see
that
noble
and
most
sovereign
reason
Like
sweet
bells
jangled
out
of
tune
and
harsh
That
unmatch
d
form
and
feature
of
blown
youth
Blasted
with
ecstasy
O
woe
is
me
T
have
seen
what
I
have
seen
see
what
I
see
Enter
King
and
Polonius
King
Love
his
affections
do
not
that
way
tend
Nor
what
he
spake
though
it
lack
d
form
a
little
Was
not
like
madness
There
s
something
in
his
soul
O
er
which
his
melancholy
sits
on
brood
And
I
do
doubt
the
hatch
and
the
disclose
Will
be
some
danger
which
for
to
prevent
I
have
in
quick
determination
Thus
set
it
down
he
shall
with
speed
to
England
For
the
demand
of
our
neglected
tribute
Haply
the
seas
and
countries
different
With
variable
objects
shall
expel
This
something
settled
matter
in
his
heart
Whereon
his
brains
still
beating
puts
him
thus
From
fashion
of
himself
What
think
you
on
t
Pol
It
shall
do
well
But
yet
do
I
believe
The
origin
and
commencement
of
his
grief
Sprung
from
neglected
love
How
now
Ophelia
You
need
not
tell
us
what
Lord
Hamlet
said
We
heard
it
all
My
lord
do
as
you
please
But
if
you
hold
it
fit
after
the
play
Let
his
queen
mother
all
alone
entreat
him
To
show
his
grief
Let
her
be
round
with
him
And
I
ll
be
plac
d
so
please
you
in
the
ear
Of
all
their
conference
If
she
find
him
not
To
England
send
him
or
confine
him
where
Your
wisdom
best
shall
think
King
It
shall
be
so

Exeunt
Scene
II
Elsinore
hall
in
the
Castle
Enter
Hamlet
and
three
of
the
Players
Ham
Speak
the
speech
I
pray
you
as
I
pronounc
d
it
to
you
trippingly
on
the
tongue
But
if
you
mouth
it
as
many
of
our
players
do
I
had
as
live
the
town
crier
spoke
my
lines
Nor
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
for
in
the
very
torrent
tempest
and
as
I
may
say
whirlwind
of
your
passion
you
must
acquire
and
beget
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
O
it
offends
me
to
the
soul
to
hear
a
robustious
periwig
pated
fellow
tear
a
passion
to
tatters
to
very
rags
to
split
the
cars
of
the
groundlings
who
for
the
most
part
are
capable
of
nothing
but
inexplicable
dumb
shows
and
noise
I
would
have
such
a
fellow
whipp
d
for
o
erdoing
Termagant
It
out
herods
Herod
Pray
you
avoid
it
Player
I
warrant
your
honour
Ham
Be
not
too
tame
neither
but
let
your
own
discretion
be
your
tutor
Suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
word
to
the
action
with
this
special
observance
that
you
o
erstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
anything
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at
the
first
and
now
was
and
is
to
hold
as
twere
the
mirror
up
to
nature
to
show
Virtue
her
own
feature
scorn
her
own
image
and
the
very
age
and
body
of
the
time
his
form
and
pressure
Now
this
overdone
or
come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure
of
the
which
one
must
in
your
allowance
o
erweigh
a
whole
theatre
of
others
O
there
be
players
that
I
have
seen
play
and
heard
others
praise
and
that
highly
not
to
speak
it
profanely
that
neither
having
the
accent
of
Christians
nor
the
gait
of
Christian
pagan
nor
man
have
so
strutted
and
bellowed
that
I
have
thought
some
of
Nature
s
journeymen
had
made
men
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitated
humanity
so
abominably
Player
I
hope
we
have
reform
d
that
indifferently
with
us
sir
Ham
O
reform
it
altogether
And
let
those
that
play
your
clowns
speak
no
more
than
is
set
down
for
them
For
there
be
of
them
that
will
themselves
laugh
to
set
on
some
quantity
of
barren
spectators
to
laugh
too
though
in
the
mean
time
some
necessary
question
of
the
play
be
then
to
be
considered
That
s
villanous
and
shows
a
most
pitiful
ambition
in
the
fool
that
uses
it
Go
make
you
ready
Exeunt
Players
Enter
Polonius
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
How
now
my
lord
Will
the
King
hear
this
piece
of
work
Pol
And
the
Queen
too
and
that
presently
Ham
Bid
the
players
make
haste
Exit
Polonius
Will
you
two
help
to
hasten
them
Both
We
will
my
lord
Exeunt

two
Ham
What

Horatio
Enter
Horatio
Hor
Here
sweet
lord
at
your
service
Ham
Horatio
thou
art

as
just
a
man
As

conversation

withal
Hor
O
my
dear
lord
Ham
Nay
do
not
think
I
flatter
For
what
advancement
may
I
hope
from
thee
That
no
revenue
hast
but
thy
good
spirits
To
feed
and
clothe
thee
Why
should
the
poor
be
flatter
d
No
let
the
candied
tongue
lick
absurd
pomp
And
crook
the
pregnant
hinges
of
the
knee
Where
thrift
may
follow
fawning
Dost
thou
hear
Since
my
dear
soul
was
mistress
of
her
choice
And
could
of
men
distinguish
her
election
Hath
scald
thee
for
herself
For
thou
hast
been
As
one
in
suff
ring
all
that
suffers
nothing
A
man
that
Fortune
s
buffets
and
rewards
Hast
ta
en
with
equal
thanks
and
blest
are
those
Whose
blood
and
judgment
are
so
well
commingled
That
they
are
not
a
pipe
for
Fortune
s
finger
To
sound
what
stop
she
please
Give
me
that
man
That
is
not
passion
s
slave
and
I
will
wear
him
In
my
heart
s
core
ay
in
my
heart
of
heart
As
I
do
thee
Something
too
much
of
this
I
There
is
a
play
to
night
before
the
King
One
scene
of
it
comes
near
the
circumstance
Which
I
have
told
thee
of
my
father
s
death
I
prithee
when
thou
seest
that
act
afoot
Even
with
the
very
comment
of
thy
soul
Observe
my
uncle
If
his
occulted
guilt
Do
not
itself
unkennel
in
one
speech
It
is
a
damned
ghost
that
we
have
seen
And
my
imaginations
are
as
foul
As
Vulcan
s
stithy
Give
him
heedful
note
For
I
mine
eyes
will
rivet
to
his
face
And
after
we
will
both
our
judgments
join
In
censure
of
his
seeming
Hor
Well
my
lord
If
he
steal
aught
the
whilst
this
play
is
playing
And
scape
detecting
I
will
pay
the
theft
