Her
blush
is
guiltiness
not
modesty
Leon
What
do
you
mean
my
lord
Claud
Not
to
be
married
Not
to
knit
my
soul
to
an
approved
wanton
Leon
Dear
my
lord
if
you
in
your
own
proof
Have
vanquish
d
the
resistance
of
her
youth
And
made
defeat
of
her
virginity
Claud
I
know
what
you
would
say
If
I
have
known
her
You
will
say
she
did
embrace
me
as
a
husband
And
so
extenuate
the
forehand
sin
No
Leonato
I
never
tempted
her
with
word
too
large
But
as
a
brother
to
his
sister
show
d
Bashful
sincerity
and
comely
love
Hero
And
seem
d
I
ever
otherwise
to
you
Claud
Out
on
the
seeming
I
will
write
against
it
You
seem
to
me
as
Dian
in
her
orb
As
chaste
as
is
the
bud
ere
it
be
blown
But
you
are
more
intemperate
in
your
blood
Than
Venus
or
those
pamp
red
animals
That
rage
in
savage
sensuality
Hero
Is
my
lord
well
that
he
doth
speak
so
wide
Leon
Sweet
Prince
why
speak
not
you
Pedro
What
should
I
speak
I
stand
dishonour
d
that
have
gone
about
To
link
my
dear
friend
to
a
common
stale
Leon
Are
these
things
spoken
or
do
I
but
dream
John
Sir
they
are
spoken
and
these
things
are
true
Bene
This
looks
not
like
a
nuptial
Hero
True
O
God
Claud
Leonato
stand
I
here
Is
this
the
Prince
Is
this
the
Prince

Is
this

Are

own
Leon
All
this
is
so
but
what
of
this
my
lord
Claud
Let
me
but
move
one
question
to
your
daughter
And
by
that
fatherly
and
kindly
power
That
you
have
in
her
bid
her
answer
truly
Leon
I
charge
thee
do
so
as
thou
art
my
child
Hero
O
God
defend
me
How
am
I
beset
What
kind
of
catechising
call
you
this
Claud
To
make
you
answer
truly
to
your
name
Hero
Is
it
not
Hero
Who
can
blot
that
name
With
any
just
reproach
Claud
Marry
that
can
Hero
Hero
itself
can
blot
out
Hero
s
virtue
What
man
was
he
talk
d
with
you
yesternight
Out
at
your
window
betwixt
twelve
and
one
Now
if
you
are
a
maid
answer
to
this
Hero
I
talk
d
with
no
man
at
that
hour
my
lord
Pedro
Why
then
are
you
no
maiden
Leonato
I
am
sorry
you
must
hear
Upon
my
honour
Myself
my
brother
and
this
grieved
Count
Did
see
her
hear
her
at
that
hour
last
night
Talk
with
a
ruffian
at
her
chamber
window
Who
hath
indeed
most
like
a
liberal
villain
Confess
d
the
vile
encounters
they
have
had
A
thousand
times
in
secret
John
Fie
fie
they
are
not
to
be
nam
d
my
lord
Not
to
be
spoke
of
There
is
not
chastity
enough
in
language
Without
offence
to
utter
them
Thus
pretty
lady
I
am
sorry
for
thy
much
misgovernment
Claud
O
Hero
what
a
Hero
hadst
thou
been
If
half
thy
outward
graces
had
been
plac
d
About
thy
thoughts
and
counsels
of
thy
heart
But
fare
thee
well
most
foul
most
fair
Farewell
Thou
pure
impiety
and
impious
purity
For
thee
I
ll
lock
up
all
the
gates
of
love
And
on
my
eyelids
shall
conjecture
hang
To
turn
all
beauty
into
thoughts
of
harm
And
never
shall
it
more
be
gracious

Cry

Could

The
story
that

Do
not

Hero
do

For
did
I

Thought

Why

Why

Why

not
with
charitable

Took
up

Who
smirched
thus
and

with
infamy
I
might
have

No

Valuing

Into

the

Hath

To

were

No

until

I
have
this
twelvemonth
been

bedfellow
Leon
Confirm

O
that
is

Which
was

barr

Would

Who

speaking

Wash

it

Hence
from
her
let

Friar
Hear
me
a
little
For
I
have
only
been
silent
so
long
And
given
way
unto
this
course
of
fortune
By
noting
of
the
lady
I
have
mark
d
A
thousand
blushing
apparitions
To
start
into
her
face
a
thousand
innocent
shames
In
angel
whiteness
beat
away
those
blushes
And
in
her
eye
there
hath
appear
d
a
fire
To
burn
the
errors
that
these
princes
hold
Against
her
maiden
truth
Call
me
a
fool
Trust
not
my
reading
nor
my
observation
Which
with
experimental
seal
doth
warrant
The
tenure
of
my
book
trust
not
my
age
My
reverence
calling
nor
divinity
If
this
sweet
lady
lie
not
guiltless
here
Under
some
biting
error
Leon
Friar
it
cannot
be
Thou
seest
that
all
the
grace
that
she
hath
left
Is
that
she
will
not
add
to
her
damnation
A
sin
of
perjury
she
not
denies
it
Why
seek
st
thou
then
to
cover
with
excuse
That
which
appears
in
proper
nakedness
Friar
Lady
what
man
is
he
you
are
accus
d
of
Hero
They
know
that
do
accuse
me
I
know
none
If
I
know
more
of
any
man
alive
Than
that
which
maiden
modesty
doth
warrant
Let
all
my
sins
lack
mercy
O
my
father
Prove
you
that
any
man
with
me
convers

At

unmeet
or
that
I
yesternight
Maintain
d
the
change
of

with
any

Refuse
me

torture
me
to
death
Friar
There
is
some
strange
misprision
in
the
princes
Bene
Two
of
them
have
the
very
bent
of
honour
And
if
their
wisdoms
be
misled
in
this
The
practice
of
it
lives
in
John
the
bastard
Whose
spirits
toil
in
frame
of
villanies
Leon
I
know
not
If
they
speak
but
truth
of
her
These
hands
shall
tear
her
If
they
wrong
her
honour
The
proudest
of
them
shall
well
hear
of
it
Time
hath
not
yet
so
dried
this
blood
of
mine
Nor
age
so
eat
up
my
invention
Nor
fortune
made
such
havoc
of
my
means
Nor
my
bad
life
reft
me
so
much
of
friends
But
they
shall
find
awak
d
in
such
a
kind
Both
strength
of
limb
and
policy
of
mind
Ability
in
means
and
choice
of
friends
To
quit
me
of
them
throughly
Friar
Pause
awhile
And
let
my
counsel
sway
you
in
this
case
Your
daughter
here
the
princes
left
for
dead
Let
her
awhile
be
secretly
kept
in
And
publish
it
that
she
is
dead
indeed
Maintain
a
mourning
ostentation
And
on
your
family
s
old
monument
Hang
mournful
epitaphs
and
do
all
rites
That
appertain
unto
a
burial
Leon
What
shall
become
of
this
What
will
this
do
Friar
Marry
this
well
carried
shall
on
her
behalf
Change
slander
to
remorse
That
is
some
good
But
not
for
that
dream
I
on
this
strange
course
But
on
this
travail
look
for
greater
birth
She
dying
as
it
must
be
so
maintain
d
Upon
the
instant
that
she
was
accus
d
Shall
be
lamented
pitied
and
excus
d
Of
every
hearer
for
it
so
falls
out
That
what
we
have
we
prize
not
to
the
worth
Whiles
we
enjoy
it
but
being
lack
d
and
lost
Why
then
we
rack
the
value
then
we
find
The
virtue
that
possession
would
not
show
us
Whiles
it
was
ours
So
will
it
fare
with
Claudio
When
he
shall
hear
she
died
upon
his
words
Th
idea
of
her
life
shall
sweetly
creep
Into
his
study
of
imagination
And
every
lovely
organ
of
her
life
Shall
come
apparell
d
in
more
precious
habit
More
moving
delicate
and
full
of
life
Into
the
eye
and
prospect
of
his
soul
Than
when
she
liv
d
indeed
Then
shall
he
mourn
If
ever
love
had
interest
in
his
liver
And
wish
he
had
not
so
accused
her
No
though
be
thought
his
accusation
true
Let
this
be
so
and
doubt
not
but
success
Will
fashion
the
event
in
better
shape
Than
I
can
lay
it
down
in
likelihood
But
if
all
aim
but
this
be
levell
d
false
The
supposition
of
the
lady
s
death
Will
quench
the
wonder
of
her
infamy
And
if
it
sort
not
well
you
may
conceal
her
As
best
befits
her
wounded
reputation
In
some
reclusive
and
religious
life
Out
of
all
eyes
tongues
minds
and
injuries
Bene
Signior
Leonato
let
the
friar
advise
you
And
though
you
know
my
inwardness
and
love
Is
very
much
unto
the
Prince
and
Claudio
Yet
by
mine
honour
I
will
deal
in
this
As
secretly
and
justly
as
your
soul
Should
with
your
body
Leon
Being
that
I
flow
in
grief
The
smallest
twine
may
lead
me
Friar
Tis
well
consented
Presently
away
For
to
strange
sores
strangely
they
strain
the
cure
Come
lady
die
to
live
This
wedding
day
Perhaps
is
but
prolong
d
Have
patience
and
endure
Exeunt
all
but
Benedick
and
Beatrice
Bene
Lady
Beatrice
have
you
wept
all
this
while
Beat
Yea
and
I
will
weep
a
while
longer
Bene
I
will
not
desire
that
Beat
You
have
no
reason
I
do
it
freely
Bene
Surely
I
do
believe
your
fair
cousin
is
wronged
Beat
Ah
how
much
might
the
man
deserve
of
me
that
would
right
her
Bene
Is
there
any
way
to
show
such
friendship
Beat
A
very
even
way
but
no
such
friend
Bene
May
a
man
do
it
Beat
It
is
a
man
s
office
but
not
yours
Bene
I
do
love
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
as
you
Is
not
that
strange
Beat
As
strange
as
the
thing
I
know
not
It
were
as
possible
for
me
to
say
I
loved
nothing
so
well
as
you
But
believe
me
not
and
yet
I
lie
not
I
confess
nothing
nor
I
deny
nothing
I
am
sorry
for
my
cousin
Bene
By
my
sword
Beatrice
thou
lovest
me
Beat
Do
not
swear
and
eat
it
Bene
I
will
swear
by
it
that
you
love
me
and
I
will
make
him
eat
it
that
says
I
love
not
you
Beat
Will
you
not
eat
your
word
Bene
With
no
sauce
that
can
be
devised
to
it
I
protest
I
love
thee
Beat
Why
then
God
forgive
me
Bene
What
offence
sweet
Beatrice
Beat
You
have
stayed
me
in
a
happy
hour
I
was
about
to
protest
I
loved
you
Bene
And
do
it
with
all
thy
heart
Beat
I
love
you
with
so
much
of
my
heart
that
none
is
left
to
protest
Bene
Come
bid
me
do
anything
for
thee
Beat
Kill
Claudio
Bene
Ha
not
for
the
wide
world
Beat
You
kill
me
to
deny
it
Farewell
Bene
Tarry
sweet
Beatrice
Beat
I
am
gone
though
I
am
here
There
is
no
love
in
you
Nay
I
pray
you
let
me
go
Bene
Beatrice
Beat
In
faith
I
will
go
Bene
We
ll
be
friends
first
Beat
You
dare
easier
be
friends
with
me
than
fight
with
mine
enemy
Bene
Is
Claudio
thine
enemy
Beat
Is
a
not
approved
in
the
height
a
villain
that
hath
slandered
scorned
dishonoured
my
kinswoman
O
that
I
were
a
man
What
bear
her
in
hand
until
they
come
to
take
hands
and
then
with
public
accusation
uncover
d
slander
unmitigated
rancour
O
God
that
I
were
a
man
I
would
eat
his
heart
in
the
market
place
Bene
Hear
me
Beatrice
Beat
Talk
with
a

out
at
a
window
a
proper
saying
Bene
Nay

Sweet

is
undone
Bene

Beat
Princes

Surely
a
princely
testimony
a
goodly

that
I
were
a

for
his
sake
or
that
I
had
any

would
be
a

for
my

But
manhood

valour
into
compliment

trim

He
is
now
as
valiant

Hercules
that
only
tells
a

and
swears
it
I
cannot
be
a

with
wishing
therefore
I
will
die
a

grieving
Bene
Tarry
good
Beatrice
By
this
hand
I
love
thee
Beat
Use
it
for
my
love
some
other
way
than
swearing
by
it
Bene
Think

in
your
soul
the
Count
Claudio
hath
wrong

Hero
Beat
Yea
as

challenge
him
I

your

As

Go

I

ACT
V
Scene
I
The
street
near
Leonato
s
house
Enter
Leonato
and
his
brother
Antonio
Ant
If
you
go
on
thus
you
will
kill
yourself
And
tis
not
wisdom
thus
to
second
grief
Against
yourself
Leon
I
pray
thee
cease
thy
counsel
Which
falls
into
mine
ears
as
profitless
As
water
in
a
sieve
Give
not
me
counsel
Nor
let
no
comforter
delight
mine
ear
But
such
a
one
whose
wrongs
do
suit
with
mine
Bring
me
a
father
that
so
lov
d
his
child
Whose
joy
of
her
is
overwhelm
d
like
mine
And
bid
him
speak
to
me
of
patience
Measure
his
woe
the
length
and
breadth
of
mine
And
let
it
answer
every
strain
for
strain
As
thus
for
thus
and
such
a
grief
for
such
In
every
lineament
branch
shape
and
form
If
such
a
one
will
smile
and
stroke
his
beard
Bid
sorrow
wag
cry
hem
when
he
should
groan
Patch
grief
with
proverbs
make
misfortune
drunk
With
candle
wasters
bring
him
yet
to
me
And
I
of
him
will
gather
patience
But
there
is
no
such
man
for
brother
men
Can
counsel
and
speak
comfort
to
that
grief
Which
they
themselves
not
feel
but
tasting
it
Their
counsel
turns
to
passion
which
before
Would
give
preceptial
medicine
to
rage
Fetter
strong
madness
in
a
silken
thread
Charm
ache
with
air
and
agony
with
words
No
no
Tis
all
men
s
office
to
speak
patience
To
those
that
wring
under
the
load
of
sorrow
But
no
man
s
virtue
nor
sufficiency
To
be
so
moral
when
he
shall
endure
The
like
himself
Therefore
give
me
no
counsel
My
griefs
cry
louder
than
advertisement
Ant
Therein
do
men
from
children
nothing
differ
Leon
I
pray
thee
peace
I
will
be
flesh
and
blood
For
there
was
never
yet
philosopher
That
could
endure
the
toothache
patiently
However
they
have
writ
the
style
of
gods
And
made
a
push
at
chance
and
sufferance
Ant
Yet
bend
not
all
the
harm
upon
yourself
Make
those
that
do
offend
you
suffer
too
Leon
There
thou
speak
st
reason
Nay
I
will
do
so
My
soul
doth
tell
me
Hero
is
belied
And
that
shall
Claudio
know
so
shall
the
Prince
And
all
of
them
that
thus
dishonour
her
Enter
Don
Pedro
and
Claudio
Ant
Here
comes
the
Prince
and
Claudio
hastily
Pedro
Good
den
Good
den
Claud
Good
day
to
both
of
you
Leon
Hear
you
my
lords
Pedro
We
have
some
haste
Leonato
Leon
Some
haste
my
lord
well
fare
you
well
my
lord
Are
you
so
hasty
now
Well
all
is
one
Pedro
Nay
do
not
quarrel
with
us
good
old
man
Ant
If
he
could
right
himself
with
quarrelling
Some
of
us
would
lie
low
Claud
Who
wrongs
him
Leon
Marry
thou
dost
wrong
me
thou
dissembler
thou
Nay
never
lay
thy
hand
upon
thy
sword
I
fear
thee
not
Claud
Mary
beshrew
my
hand
If
it
should
give
your
age
such
cause
of
fear
In
faith
my
hand
meant
nothing
to
my
sword
Leon
Tush
tush
man
never
fleer
and
jest
at
me
I
speak
not
like
a
dotard
nor
a
fool
As
under
privilege
of
age
to
brag
What
I
have
done
being
young
or
what
would
do
Were
I
not
old
Know
Claudio
to
thy
head
Thou
hast
so
wrong
d
mine
innocent
child
and
me
That
I
am
forc
d
to
lay
my
reverence
by
And
with
grey
hairs
and
bruise
of
many
days
Do
challenge
thee
to
trial
of
a
man
I
say
thou
hast
belied
mine
innocent
child
Thy
slander
hath
gone
through
and
through
her
heart
And
she
lied
buried
with
her
ancestors
O
in
a
tomb
where
never
scandal
slept
Save
this
of
hers
fram
d
by
thy
villany
Claud
My
villany
Leon
Thine
Claudio
thine
I
say
Pedro
You
say
not
right
old
man
Leon
My
lord
my
lord
I
ll
prove
it
on
his
body
if
he
dare
Despite
his
nice
fence
and
his
active
practice
His
May
of
youth
and
bloom
of
lustihood
Claud
Away
I
will
not
have
to
do
with
you
Leon
Canst
thou
so
daff

Thou
hast
kill
d
my
child
If
thou
kill
st
me
boy
thou
shalt
kill
a
man
And
He
shall
kill
two
of
us
and
men
indeed
But
that
s
no
matter
let
him
kill
one
first
Win
me
and
wear
me
Let
him
answer
me
Come

Content

And

death
by
villains
That

as
well
answer
a
man

As
I

take
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
Boys

Leon
Brother
Anthony
Ant
Hold

What

And

they
weigh
even
to
the
utmost
scruple
Scambling
outfacing

monging

That
lie
and
cog
and
flout
deprave
and
slander
Go
anticly
show
outward
hideousness
And
speak
off
half
a
dozen
dang
rous
words
How
they
might
hurt
their
enemies
if
they
durst
And
this
is
all
Leon
But

Anthony
Ant
Come

no
