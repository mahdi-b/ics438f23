Northumberland
NORTHUMBERLAND
Hold
Clifford
do
not
honour
him
so
much
To
prick
thy
finger
though
to
wound
his
heart
What
valour
were
it
when
a
cur
doth
grin
For
one
to
thrust
his
hand
between
his
teeth
When
he
might
spurn
him
with
his
foot
away
It
is
war
s
prize
to
take
all
vantages
And
ten
to

They

Ay

So

So

So

What
would
your
Grace
have
done
unto
him
now
QUEEN
MARGARET
Brave
warriors
Clifford
and
Northumberland
Come
make
him
stand
upon
this
molehill
here
That
raught
at
mountains
with
outstretched
arms
Yet
parted
but
the
shadow
with
his
hand
What
was
it
you
that
would
be
England
s
king
Was
t
you
that
revell
d
in
our
parliament
And
made
a
preachment
of
your
high
descent
Where
are
your
mess
of
sons
to
back
you
now
The
wanton
Edward
and
the
lusty
George
And
where
s
that
valiant
crook
back
prodigy
Dicky
your
boy
that
with
his
grumbling
voice
Was
wont
to
cheer
his
dad
in
mutinies
Or
with
the
rest
where
is
your
darling
Rutland
Look
York
I
stain
d
this
napkin
with
the
blood
That
valiant
Clifford
with
his
rapier
s
point
Made
issue
from
the
bosom
of
the
boy
And
if
thine
eyes
can
water
for
his
death
I
give
thee
this
to
dry
thy
cheeks
withal
Alas
poor
York
but
that
I
hate
thee
deadly
I
should
lament
thy
miserable
state
I
prithee
grieve
to
make
me
merry
York
What
hath
thy
fiery
heart
so
parch
d
thine
entrails
That
not
a
tear
can
fall
for
Rutland
s
death
Why
art
thou
patient
man
Thou
shouldst
be
mad
And
I
to
make
thee
mad
do
mock
thee
thus
Stamp
rave
and
fret
that
I
may
sing
and
dance
Thou
wouldst
be
fee
d
I
see
to
make
me
sport
York
cannot
speak
unless
he
wear
a
crown
A
crown
for
York
and
lords
bow
low
to
him
Hold
you
his
hands
whilst
I
do
set
it
on
Putting
a
paper
crown
on
his
head
Ay
marry
sir
now
looks
he
like
a
king
Ay
this
is
he
that
took
King
Henry
s
chair
And
this
is
he
was
his
adopted
heir
But
how
is
it
that
great
Plantagenet
Is
crown
d
so
soon
and
broke
his
solemn
oath
As
I
bethink
me
you
should
not
be
King
Till
our
King
Henry
had
shook
hands
with
death
And
will
you
pale
your
head
in
Henry
s
glory
And
rob
his
temples
of
the
diadem
Now
in
his
life
against
your
holy
oath
O
tis
a
fault
too
too
Off
with
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
his
head
And
whilst
we
breathe
take
time
to
do
him
dead
CLIFFORD
That
is
my
office
for
my
father
s
sake
QUEEN
MARGARET
Nay
stay
let
s
hear
the
orisons
he
makes
YORK
She
wolf
of
France
but
worse
than
wolves
of
France
Whose
tongue
more
poisons
than
the
adder
s
tooth
How
ill
beseeming
is
it
in
thy
sex
To
triumph
like
an
Amazonian
trull
Upon
their
woes
whom
fortune
captivates
But
that
thy
face
is
visard
like
unchanging
Made
impudent
with
use
of
evil
deeds
I
would
assay
proud
queen
to
make
thee
blush
To
tell
thee
whence
thou
cam
st
of
whom
deriv
d
Were
shame
enough
to
shame
thee
wert
thou
not
shameless
Thy
father
bears
the
type
of
King
of
Naples
Of
both
the
Sicils
and
Jerusalem
Yet
not
so
wealthy
as
an
English
yeoman
Hath
that
poor
monarch
taught
thee
to
insult
It
needs
not
nor
it
boots
thee
not
proud
queen
Unless
the
adage
must
be
verified
That
beggars
mounted
run
their
horse
to
death
Tis
beauty
that
doth
oft
make
women
proud
But
God
He
knows
thy
share
thereof
is
small
Tis
virtue
that
doth
make
them
most
admir
d
The
contrary
doth
make
thee
wond
red
at
Tis
government
that
makes
them
seem
divine
The
want
thereof
makes
thee
abominable
Thou
art
as
opposite
to
every
good
As
the
Antipodes
are
unto
us
Or
as
the
south
to
the
septentrion
O
tiger
s
heart
wrapp
d
in
a
woman
s
hide
How
couldst
thou
drain
the
life
blood
of
the
child
To
bid
the
father
wipe
his
eyes
withal
And
yet
be
seen
to
bear
a
woman
s
face
Women
are
soft
mild
pitiful
and
flexible
Thou
stern
obdurate
flinty
rough
remorseless
Bid
st
thou
me
rage
Why
now
thou
hast
thy
wish
Wouldst
have
me
weep
Why
now
thou
hast
thy
will
For
raging
wind
blows
up
incessant
showers
And
when
the
rage
allays
the
rain
begins
These
tears
are
my
sweet
Rutland
s
obsequies
And
every
drop
cries
vengeance
for
his
death
Gainst
thee
fell
Clifford
and
thee
false
Frenchwoman
NORTHUMBERLAND
Beshrew
me
but
his
passions
move
me
so
That
hardly
can
I
check
my
eyes
from
tears
YORK
That
face
of
his
the
hungry
cannibals
Would
not
have
touch
d
would
not
have
stain
d
with
blood
But
you
are
more
inhuman
more
inexorable
O
ten
times
more
than
tigers
of
Hyrcania
See
ruthless
queen
a
hapless
father

tears
This
cloth
thou
dipp
dst
in
blood
of
my
sweet
boy
And
I
with
tears
do
wash
the
blood
away
Keep
thou
the
napkin
and
go
boast
of
this
And
if
thou
tell
st
the
heavy
story
right
Upon
my
soul
the
hearers
will
shed
tears
Yea
even
my
foes
will
shed
fast
falling
tears
And
say
Alas
it
was
a
piteous
deed
There
take
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
my
curse
And
in
thy
need
such
comfort

thee
As

thy
too
cruel
hand
Hard

Clifford

me

My

NORTHUMBERLAND
Had

I

SCENE
I
A
plain
near
Mortimer
s
Cross
in
Herefordshire
A
march
Enter
EDWARD
RICHARD
and
their
power
EDWARD
I
wonder
how
our
princely
father
scap
d
Or
whether
he
be
scap
d
away
or
no
From
Clifford
s
and
Northumberland
s
pursuit
Had
he
been
ta
en
we
should
have
heard
the
news
Had
he
been
slain
we
should
have
heard
the
news
Or
had
he
scap
d
methinks
we
should
have
heard
The
happy
tidings
of
his
good
escape
How
fares
my
brother
Why
is
he
so
sad
RICHARD
I
cannot
joy
until
I
be
resolv
d
Where
our
right
valiant
father
is
become
I
saw
him
in
the
battle
range
about
And
watch
d
him
how
he
singled
Clifford
forth
Methought
he
bore
him
in
the
thickest
troop
As
doth
a
lion
in
a
herd
of
neat
Or
as
a
bear
encompass
d
round
with
dogs
Who
having
pinch
d
a
few
and
made
them
cry
The
rest
stand
all
aloof
and
bark
at
him
So
far
d
our
father
with
his
enemies
So
fled
his
enemies
my
warlike
father
Methinks
tis
prize
enough
to
be
his
son
See
how
the
morning
opes
her
golden
gates
And
takes
her
farewell
of
the
glorious
sun
How
well
resembles
it
the
prime
of
youth
Trimm
d
like
a
younker
prancing
to
his
love
EDWARD
Dazzle
mine
eyes
or
do
I
see
three
suns
RICHARD
Three
glorious
suns
each
one
a
perfect
sun
Not
separated
with
the
racking
clouds
But
sever
d
in
a
pale
clear
shining
sky
See
see
they
join
embrace
and
seem
to
kiss
As
if
they
vow
d
some
league
inviolable
Now
are
they
but
one
lamp
one
light
one
sun
In
this
the
heaven
figures
some
event
EDWARD
Tis
wondrous
strange
the
like
yet
never
heard
of
I
think
it
cites
us
brother
to
the
field
That
we
the
sons
of
brave
Plantagenet
Each
one
already
blazing
by
our
meeds
Should
notwithstanding
join
our
lights
together
And
overshine
the
earth
as
this
the
world
Whate
er
it
bodes
henceforward
will
I
bear
Upon
my
target
three
fair
shining
suns
RICHARD
Nay
bear
three
daughters
by
your
leave
I
speak
it
You
love
the
breeder
better
than
the
male
Enter
a
MESSENGER
blowing
But
what
art
thou
whose
heavy
looks
foretell
Some
dreadful
story
hanging
on
thy
tongue
MESSENGER
Ah
one
that
was
a
woeful
looker
on
When
as
the
noble
Duke
of
York
was
slain
Your
princely
father
and
my
loving
lord
EDWARD
O
speak
no
more
for
I
have
heard
too
much
RICHARD
Say
how
he
died
for
I
will
hear
it
all
MESSENGER
Environed
he
was
with
many
foes
And
stood
against
them
as
the
hope
of
Troy
Against
the
Greeks
that
would
have
ent
red
Troy
But
Hercules
himself
must
yield
to
odds
And
many
strokes
though
with
a
little
axe
Hews
down
and
fells
the
hardest
timber
d
oak
By
many
hands
your
father
was
subdu
d
But
only
slaught
red
by
the
ireful
arm
Of
unrelenting
Clifford
and
the
Queen
Who
crown
d
the
gracious
Duke
in
high
despite
Laugh
d
in
his
face
and
when
with
grief
he
wept
The
ruthless
Queen
gave
him
to
dry
his
cheeks
A
napkin
steeped
in
the
harmless
blood
Of
sweet
young
Rutland
by
rough
Clifford
slain
And
after
many
scorns
many
foul
taunts
They
took
his
head
and
on
the
gates
of
York
They
set
the
same
and
there
it
doth
remain
The
saddest
spectacle
that
e
er
I
view
d
EDWARD
Sweet
Duke
of
York
our
prop
to
lean
upon
Now
thou
art
gone
we
have
no
staff
no
stay
O
Clifford
boist
rous
Clifford
thou
hast
slain
The
flow
r
of
Europe
for
his
chivalry
And
treacherously
hast
thou
vanquish
d
him
For
hand
to
hand
he
would
have
vanquish
d
thee
Now
my
soul
s
palace
is
become
a
prison
Ah
would
she
break
from
hence
that
this
my
body
Might
in
the
ground
be
closed
up
in
rest
For
never
henceforth
shall
I
joy
again
Never
O
never
shall
I
see
more
joy
RICHARD
I
cannot
weep
for
all
my
body
s
moisture
Scarce
serves
to
quench
my
furnace
burning
heart
Nor
can
my
tongue
unload
my
heart
s
great
burden
For
self
same
wind
that
I
should
speak
withal
Is
kindling
coals
that
fires
all
my
breast
And
burns
me
up
with
flames
that
tears
would
quench
To
weep
is
to
make
less
the
depth
of
grief
Tears
then
for
babes
blows
and
revenge
for
me
Richard
I
bear
thy
name
I
ll
venge
thy
death
Or
die
renowned
by
attempting
it
EDWARD
His
name
that
valiant
duke
hath
left
with
thee
His
dukedom
and
his
chair
with
me
is

RICHARD
Nay
if

that
princely
eagle
s
bird
Show
thy
descent
by
gazing
gainst
the
sun
For

and

March
Enter
WARWICK
MONTAGUE
and
their
army
WARWICK
How
now
fair
lords
What
fare
What
news
abroad
RICHARD
Great
Lord
of
Warwick
if
we
should
recount
Our
baleful
news
and
at
each
word
s
deliverance
Stab
poinards
in
our
flesh
till
all
were
told
The
words
would
add
more
anguish
than
the
wounds
O
valiant
lord
the
Duke
of
York
is
slain
EDWARD
O
Warwick
Warwick
that
Plantagenet
Which
held
thee
dearly
as
his
soul
s
redemption
Is
by
the
stern
Lord
Clifford
done
to
death
WARWICK
Ten
days
ago
I
drown
d
these
news
in
tears
And
now
to
add
more
measure
to
your
woes
I
come
to
tell
you
things
sith
then
befall
n
After
the
bloody
fray
at
Wakefield
fought
Where
your
brave
father
breath
d
his
latest
gasp
Tidings
as
swiftly
as
the
posts
could
run
Were
brought
me
of
your
loss
and
his
depart
I
then
in
London
keeper
of
the
King
Muster
d
my
soldiers
gathered
flocks
of
friends
And
very
well
appointed
as
I
thought
March
d
toward
Saint
Albans
to
intercept
the
Queen
Bearing
the
King
in
my
behalf
along
For
by
my
scouts
I
was
advertised
That
she
was
coming
with
a
full
intent
To
dash
our
late
decree
in
parliament
Touching
King
Henry
s
oath
and
your
succession
Short
tale
to
make
we
at
Saint
Albans
met
Our
battles
join
d
and
both
sides
fiercely
fought
But
whether
twas
the
coldness
of
the
King
Who
look
d
full
gently
on
his
warlike
queen
That
robb
d
my
soldiers
of
their
heated
spleen
Or
whether
twas
report
of
her
success
Or
more
than
common
fear
of
Clifford
s
rigour
Who
thunders
to
his
captives
blood
and
death
I
cannot
judge
but
to
conclude
with
truth
Their
weapons
like
to
lightning
came
and
went
Our
soldiers
like
the
night
owl
s
lazy
flight
Or
like
an
idle
thresher
with
a
flail
Fell
gently
down
as
if
they
struck
their
friends
I
cheer
d
them
up
with
justice
of
our
cause
With
promise
of
high
pay
and
great
rewards
But
all
in
vain
they
had
no
heart
to
fight
And
we
in
them
no
hope
to
win
the
day
So
that
we
fled
the
King
unto
the
Queen
Lord
George
your
brother
Norfolk
and
myself
In
haste
post
haste
are
come
to
join
with
you
For
in
the
marches
here
we
heard
you
were
Making
another
head
to
fight
again
EDWARD
Where
is
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
gentle
Warwick
And
when
came
George
from
Burgundy
to
England
WARWICK
Some
six
miles
off
the
Duke
is
with
the
soldiers
And
for
your
brother
he
was
lately
sent
From
your
kind
aunt
Duchess
of
Burgundy
With
aid
of
soldiers
to
this
needful
war
RICHARD
Twas
odds
belike
when
valiant
Warwick
fled
Oft
have
I
heard
his
praises
in
pursuit
But
ne
er
till
now
his
scandal
of
retire
WARWICK
Nor
now
my
scandal
Richard
dost
thou
hear
For
thou
shalt
know
this
strong
right
hand
of
mine
Can
pluck
the
diadem
from
faint
Henry
s
head
And
wring
the
awful
sceptre
from
his
fist
Were
he
as
famous
and
as
bold
in
war
As
he
is
fam
d
for
mildness
peace
and
prayer
RICHARD
I
know
it
well
Lord
Warwick
blame
me
not
Tis
love
I
bear
thy
glories
makes
me
speak
But
in
this
troublous
time
what
s
to
be
done
Shall
we
go
throw
away
our
coats
of
steel
And
wrap
our
bodies
in
black
mourning
gowns
Numbering
our
Ave
Maries
with
our
beads
Or
shall
we
on
the
helmets
of
our
foes
Tell
our
devotion
with
revengeful
arms
If
for
the
last
say
Ay
and
to
it
lords
WARWICK
Why
therefore
Warwick
came
to
seek
you
out
And
therefore
comes
my
brother
Montague
Attend
me
lords
The
proud
insulting
Queen
With
Clifford
and
the
haught
Northumberland
And
of
their
feather
many
moe
proud
birds
Have
wrought
the
easy
melting
King
like
wax
He
swore
consent
to
your
succession
His
oath
enrolled
in
the
parliament
And
now
to
London
all
the
crew
are
gone
To
frustrate
both
his
oath
and
what
beside
May
make
against
the
house
of
Lancaster
Their
power
I
think
is
thirty
thousand
strong
Now
if
the
help
of
Norfolk
and
myself
With
all
the
friends
that
thou
brave
Earl
of
March
Amongst
the
loving
Welshmen
canst
procure
Will
but
amount
to
five
and
twenty
thousand
Why
Via
to
London
will
we
march
amain
And
once
again
bestride
our
foaming
steeds
And
once
again
cry
Charge
upon
our
foes
But
never
once
again
turn
back
and
fly
RICHARD
Ay
now
methinks
I
hear
great
Warwick
speak
Ne
er
may
he
live
to
see
a
sunshine
day
That
cries
Retire
if
Warwick
bid
him
stay
EDWARD
Lord
Warwick
on
thy
shoulder
will
I
lean
And
when
thou
fail
st
as
God
forbid
the
hour
Must
Edward
fall
which
peril
heaven
forfend
WARWICK
No
longer
Earl
of
March
but
Duke
of
York
The
next
degree
is
England
s
royal
throne
For
King
of
England
shalt
thou
be
proclaim
d
In
every
borough
as
we
pass
along
And
he
that
throws
not
up
his
cap
for
joy
Shall
for
the
fault
make
forfeit
of
his
head
King
Edward
valiant
Richard
Montague
Stay
we
no
longer
dreaming
of
renown
But
sound
the
trumpets
and
about
our
task
RICHARD
Then
Clifford
were
thy
heart
as
hard
as
steel
As
thou
hast
shown
it
flinty
by
thy
deeds
I
come
to
pierce
it
or
to
give
thee
mine
EDWARD
Then
strike
up
drums
God
and
Saint
George
for
us
Enter
a
MESSENGER
WARWICK
How
now
what
news
MESSENGER
The
Duke
of
Norfolk
sends
you
word
by
me
The
Queen
is
coming
with
a
puissant
host
And
craves
your
company
for
speedy
counsel
WARWICK
Why
then
it

brave
warriors

Exeunt
SCENE
II
Before
York
Flourish
Enter
KING
HENRY
QUEEN
MARGARET
the
PRINCE
OF
WALES
CLIFFORD
NORTHUMBERLAND
with
drum
and
trumpets
QUEEN
MARGARET
Welcome
my
lord
to
this
brave
town
of
York
Yonder
s
the
head
of
that
arch
enemy
That
sought
to
be
encompass
d
with
your
crown
Doth
not
the
object
cheer
your
heart
my
lord
KING
HENRY
Ay
as
the
rocks
cheer
them
that
fear
their
wreck
To
see
this
sight
it
irks
my
very
soul
Withhold
revenge
dear
God
tis
not
my
fault
Nor
wittingly
have
I
infring
d
my
vow
CLIFFORD
My
gracious
liege
this
too
much
lenity
And
harmful
pity
must
be
laid
aside
To
whom
do
lions
cast
their
gentle
looks
Not
to
the
beast
that
would
usurp
their
den
Whose
hand
is
that
the
forest
bear
doth
lick
Not
his
that
spoils
her
young
before
her
face
Who
scapes
the
lurking
serpent
s
mortal
sting
Not
he
that
sets
his
foot
upon
her
back
The
smallest
worm
will
turn
being
trodden
on
And
doves
will
peck
in
safeguard
of
their
brood
Ambitious
York
did
level
at
thy
crown
Thou
smiling
while
he
knit
his
angry
brows
He
but
a
Duke
would
have
his
son
a
king
And
raise
his
issue
like
a
loving
sire
Thou
being
a
king
bless
d
with
a
goodly
son
Didst
yield
consent
to
disinherit
him
Which
argued
thee
a
most
unloving
father
Unreasonable
creatures
feed
their
young
And
though
man
s
face
be
fearful
to
their
eyes
Yet
in
protection
of
their
tender
ones
Who
hath
not
seen
them
even
with
those
wings
Which
sometime
they
have
us
d
with
fearful
flight
Make
war
with
him
that
climb
d
unto
their
nest
Offering
their
own
lives
in
their
young
s
defence
For
shame
my
liege
make
them
your
precedent
Were
it
not
pity
that
this
goodly
boy
Should
lose
his
birthright
by
his
father
s
fault
And
long
hereafter
say
unto
his
child
What
my
great
grandfather
and
grandsire
got
My
careless
father
fondly
gave
away
Ah
what
a
shame
were
this
Look
on
the
boy
And
let
his
manly
face
which
promiseth
Successful
fortune
steel
thy
melting
heart
To
hold
thine
own
and
leave
thine
own
with
him
KING
HENRY
Full
well
hath
Clifford
play
d
the
orator
Inferring
arguments
of
mighty
force
But
Clifford
tell
me
didst
thou
never
hear
That
things
ill
got
had
ever
bad
success
And
happy
always
was
it
for
that
son
Whose
father
for
his
hoarding
went
to
hell
I
ll
leave
my
son
my
virtuous
deeds
behind
And
would
my
father
had
left
me
no
more
For
all
the
rest
is
held
at
such
a
rate
As
brings
a
thousand
fold
more
care
to
keep
Than
in
possession
any
jot
of
pleasure
Ah
cousin
York
would
thy
best
friends
did
know
How
it
doth
grieve
me
that
thy
head
is
here
QUEEN
MARGARET
My
lord

spirits
our
foes

And
this
soft
courage

Unsheathe

Or

QUEEN

Go

Becomes

thee
to
be
thus
bold
in
terms
Before
thy
sovereign

thy
lawful
king
EDWARD
I
am
his
king
and
he
should
bow
his
knee
I
was
adopted
heir
by
his
consent
Since
when
his
oath
is
broke
for

I
hear
You

Have
caus

To

And

Who

but

RICHARD
Are

O
I
cannot
speak
CLIFFORD
Ay
crook
back
here
I
stand
to

thee
Or
any

the
proudest
of
thy
sort
RICHARD
Twas
you
that
kill
d
young
Rutland
was
it
not
CLIFFORD
Ay
and
old
York
and
yet
not
satisfied
RICHARD
For
God
s
sake
lords
give
signal
to
the
fight
WARWICK
What
say
st
thou
Henry
Wilt
thou
yield
the
crown
QUEEN
MARGARET
Why
how
now
long
tongu
d
Warwick
Dare
you
speak
When
you
and
I
met
at
Saint
Albans
last
Your
legs
did
better
service
than
your
hands
WARWICK
Then
twas
my
turn
to
fly
and
now
tis
thine
CLIFFORD
You
said
so
much
before
and
yet
you
fled
WARWICK
Twas
not
your
valour
Clifford
drove
me
thence
NORTHUMBERLAND
No
nor
your
manhood
that
durst
make
you
stay
RICHARD
Northumberland
I
hold
thee
reverently
Break
off
the
parley
for
scarce
I
can
refrain
The
execution
of
my
big
swol
n
heart
Upon
that
Clifford
that
cruel
child
killer
CLIFFORD
I
slew
thy
father
call
st
thou
him
a
child
RICHARD
Ay
like
a
dastard
and
a
treacherous
coward
As
thou
didst
kill
our
tender
brother
Rutland
But
ere
sunset
I
ll
make
thee
curse
the
deed
KING
HENRY
Have
done
with
words
my
lords
and
hear
me
speak
QUEEN
MARGARET
Defy
them
then
or
else
hold
close

KING
HENRY
I
prithee
give

limits
to

My

wound
that
bred
this
meeting
here
Cannot
be

still
RICHARD
Then
executioner
unsheathe
thy
sword
By
Him
that
made
us
all
I
am
resolv
d
That
Clifford
s
manhood
lies
upon
his
tongue
EDWARD
Say
Henry
shall
I
have
my
right
or
no
A
thousand
men

broke
their
fasts
to
day
That
ne
er
shall
dine
unless
thou
yield
the
crown
WARWICK
If

their
blood
upon

head
For
York

justice
puts
his
armour
on
PRINCE
OF
WALES
If
that
be
right
which
Warwick
says
is
right
There
is
no
wrong
but
every
thing
is
right
RICHARD
Whoever
got
thee
there
thy
mother
stands
For
well
I
wot
thou
hast
thy
mother

tongue
QUEEN
MARGARET
But
thou
art
neither
like
thy
sire
nor
dam
