yours

Mine
boy
Not

King
Henry
be
dead
RICHARD
Your
right
depends
not
on
his
life
or
death
EDWARD
Now
you
are
heir
therefore
enjoy
it
now
By
giving
the
house
of
Lancaster
leave
to
breathe
It
will
outrun
you
father
in
the
end
YORK
I
took
an
oath
that
he
should
quietly
reign
EDWARD
But
for
a
kingdom
any
oath
may
be
broken
I
would
break
a
thousand
oaths
to
reign
one
year
RICHARD
No
God
forbid
your
Grace
should
be
forsworn
YORK
I
shall
be
if
I
claim
by
open
war
RICHARD
I
ll
prove
the
contrary
if
you
ll
hear
me
speak
YORK
Thou
canst
not
son
it
is
impossible
RICHARD
An
oath
is
of
no
moment
being
not
took
Before
a
true
and
lawful
magistrate
That
hath
authority
over
him
that
swears
Henry
had
none
but
did
usurp
the
place
Then
seeing
twas
he
that
made
you
to
depose
Your
oath
my
lord
is
vain
and
frivolous
Therefore
to
arms
And
father
do
but
think
How
sweet
a
thing
it
is
to
wear
a
crown
Within
whose
circuit
is
Elysium
And
all
that
poets
feign
of
bliss
and
joy
Why
do
we
linger
thus
I
cannot
rest
Until
the
white
rose
that
I
wear
be
dy
d
Even
in
the
lukewarm
blood
of
Henry
s
heart
YORK
Richard
enough
I
will
be
King
or
die
Brother
thou
shalt
to
London
presently
And
whet
on
Warwick
to
this
enterprise
Thou
Richard
shalt

the
Duke
of
Norfolk
And
tell
him
privily
of
our
intent
You
Edward
shall
unto
my
Lord
Cobham
With
whom
the
Kentishmen
will
willingly
rise
In
them
I
trust
for
they
are
soldiers
Witty
courteous
liberal
full
of
spirit
While
you

thus
employ

what

But
that
I
seek

Five

Though

Many

Ah

Ah

Enter

Thy

As

CLIFFORD
Soldiers

TUTOR
Ah
Clifford
murder

this
innocent

Lest
thou
be
hated
both
of
God
and

Exit
forced
off
by

CLIFFORD
How
now
is
he
dead
already
Or
is
it
fear
That
makes
him
close
his
eyes
I
ll
open
them
RUTLAND
So
looks
the
pent
up
lion
o
er
the
wretch
That
trembles
under
his
devouring
paws
And
so
he
walks
insulting
o
er
his
prey
And
so
he
comes
to
rend
his
limbs
asunder
Ah
gentle
Clifford
kill
me
with
thy
sword
And
not
with
such
a
cruel
threat
ning
look
Sweet
Clifford
hear
me
speak
before
I
die
I
am
too
mean
a
subject
for
thy
wrath
Be
thou
reveng
d
on

let
me
live
CLIFFORD
In
vain
thou
speak
st
poor
boy
my
father
s
blood
Hath
stopp
d
the
passage
where
thy
words
should
enter
RUTLAND
Then
let
my
father
s
blood
open
it
again
He
is
a
man
and
Clifford
cope
with
him
CLIFFORD
Had
I
thy
brethren
here
their
lives
and
thine
Were
not
revenge
sufficient
for
me
No
if
I
digg
d
up
thy
forefathers
graves
And
hung
their
rotten
coffins
up
in
chains
It
could
not
slake
mine
ire
nor
ease
my
heart
The
sight
of
any
of
the
house
of
York
Is
as
a
fury
to
torment
my
soul
And
till
I
root
out
their
accursed
line
And
leave
not
one
alive
I
live
in
hell
Therefore
RUTLAND
O
let
me
pray
before
I
take
my
death
To
thee
I
pray
sweet
Clifford
pity
me
CLIFFORD
Such
pity
as
my
rapier
s
point
affords
RUTLAND
I
never
did
thee
harm
why
wilt
thou
slay
me
CLIFFORD
Thy
father
hath
RUTLAND
But
twas
ere
I
was
born
Thou
hast
one
son
for
his
sake
pity
me
Lest
in
revenge
thereof
sith
God
is
just
He
be
as
miserably
slain
as
I
Ah
let
me
live
in
prison
all
my
days
And
when
I
give
occasion
of
offence
Then
let
me
die
for
now
thou
hast
no
cause
CLIFFORD
No
cause
Thy
father
slew
my
father
therefore
die
Stabs

Another

Enter
the
DUKE
OF
YORK
YORK
The
army
of
the
Queen
hath
got
the
field
My
uncles
both
are
slain
in
rescuing
me
And
all
my
followers
to
the
eager
foe
Turn
back
and
fly
like
ships
before
the
wind
Or
lambs
pursu
d
by
hunger
starved
wolves
My
sons
God
knows
what
hath
bechanced
them
But
this
I
know
they
have
demean
d
themselves
Like
men
born
to
renown
by
life
or
death
Three
times
did
Richard
make
a
lane
to
me
And
thrice
cried
Courage
father
fight
it
out
And
full
as
oft
came
Edward
to
my
side
With
purple
falchion
painted
to
the
hilt
In
blood
of
those
that
had
encount
red
him
And
when
the
hardiest
warriors
did
retire
Richard
cried
Charge
and
give
no
foot
of
ground
And
cried
A
crown
or
else
a
glorious
tomb
A
sceptre
or
an
earthly
sepulchre
With
this
we
charg
d
again
but
out
alas
We
bodg
d
again
as
I
have
seen
a
swan
With
bootless
labour
swim
against
the
tide
And
spend
her
strength
with
over
matching
waves
A
short
alarum
within
Ah
hark
The
fatal
followers
do
pursue
And
I
am
faint
and
cannot
fly
their
fury
And
were
I
strong
I
would
not
shun
their
fury
The
sands
are
numb
red
that
make
up
my
life
Here
must
I
stay

here
my
life
must
end

Yield

Ay

as
his
ruthless
arm
With
downright

unto
my
father
Now
Phaethon
hath
tumbled
from

And
made

noontide
prick
YORK
My
ashes
as

A
bird
that
will

And
in
that
hope
I
throw
mine
eyes
to
heaven
Scorning
whate
er
you

afflict
me
with
Why
come
you
not
What
multitudes
and
fear
CLIFFORD
So
cowards
fight
when
they
can
fly
no
further
So
doves
do
peck
the
falcon
s
piercing
talons
So
desperate
thieves
all
hopeless
of
their
lives
Breathe
out
invectives
gainst
the
officers
YORK
O
Clifford
but
bethink
thee
once
again
And
in
thy
thought
o
errun
my
former

And
if
thou
canst
for
blushing
view
this
face
And
bite
thy
tongue
that
slanders
him
with
cowardice
Whose
frown
hath
made
thee
faint

CLIFFORD
I

But

Hold

Clifford
