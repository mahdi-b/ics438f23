And
every
fair
with
his
fair
doth
rehearse
Making
a
couplement
of
proud
compare
With
sun
and
moon
with
earth
and
sea
s
rich
gems
With
April
s
first
born
flowers
and
all
things
rare
That
heaven
s
air
in
this
huge
rondure
hems
O
let
me
true
in
love
but
truly
write
And
then
believe
me
my
love
is
as
fair
As
any
mother
s
child
though
not
so
bright
As
those
gold
candles
fixed
in
heaven
s
air
Let
them
say
more
that
like
of
hearsay
well
I
will
not
praise
that
purpose
not
to
sell
22
My
glass
shall
not
persuade
me
I
am
old
So
long
as
youth
and
thou
are
of
one
date
But
when
in
thee
time
s
furrows
I
behold
Then
look
I
death
my
days
should
expiate
For
all
that
beauty
that
doth
cover
thee
Is
but
the
seemly
raiment
of
my
heart
Which
in
thy
breast
doth
live
as
thine
in
me
How
can
I
then
be
elder
than
thou
art
O
therefore
love
be
of
thyself
so
wary
As
I
not
for
my
self
but
for
thee
will
Bearing
thy
heart
which
I
will
keep
so
chary
As
tender
nurse
her
babe
from
faring
ill
Presume
not
on
thy
heart
when
mine
is
slain
Thou
gav
st
me
thine
not
to
give
back
again
23
As
an
unperfect
actor
on
the
stage
Who
with
his
fear
is
put
beside
his
part
Or
some
fierce
thing
replete
with
too
much
rage
Whose
strength
s
abundance
weakens
his
own
heart
So
I
for
fear
of
trust
forget
to
say
The
perfect
ceremony
of
love
s
rite
And
in
mine
own
love
s
strength
seem
to
decay
O
ercharged
with
burthen
of
mine
own
love
s
might
O
let
my
looks
be
then
the
eloquence
And
dumb
presagers
of
my
speaking
breast
Who
plead
for
love
and
look
for
recompense
More
than
that
tongue
that
more
hath
more
expressed
O
learn
to
read
what
silent
love
hath
writ
To
hear
with
eyes
belongs
to
love
s
fine
wit
24
Mine
eye
hath
played
the
painter
and
hath
stelled
Thy
beauty
s
form
in
table
of
my
heart
My
body
is
the
frame
wherein
tis
held
And
perspective
it
is
best
painter
s
art
For
through
the
painter
must
you
see
his
skill
To
find
where
your
true
image
pictured
lies
Which
in
my
bosom
s
shop
is
hanging
still
That
hath
his
windows
glazed
with
thine
eyes
Now
see
what
good
turns
eyes
for
eyes
have
done
Mine
eyes
have
drawn
thy
shape
and
thine
for
me
Are
windows
to
my
breast
where
through
the
sun
Delights
to
peep
to
gaze
therein
on
thee
Yet
eyes
this
cunning
want
to
grace
their
art
They
draw
but
what
they
see
know
not
the
heart
25
Let
those
who
are
in
favour
with
their
stars
Of
public
honour
and
proud
titles
boast
Whilst
I
whom
fortune
of
such
triumph
bars
Unlooked
for
joy
in
that
I
honour
most
Great
princes
favourites
their
fair
leaves
spread
But
as
the
marigold
at
the
sun
s
eye
And
in
themselves
their
pride
lies
buried
For
at
a
frown
they
in
their
glory
die
The
painful
warrior
famoused
for
fight
After
a
thousand
victories
once
foiled
Is
from
the
book
of
honour
razed
quite
And
all
the
rest
forgot
for
which
he
toiled
Then
happy
I
that
love
and
am
beloved
Where
I
may
not
remove
nor
be
removed
26
Lord
of
my
love
to
whom
in
vassalage
Thy
merit
hath
my
duty
strongly
knit
To
thee
I
send
this
written
embassage
To
witness
duty
not
to
show
my
wit
Duty
so
great
which
wit
so
poor
as
mine
May
make
seem
bare
in
wanting
words
to
show
it
But
that
I
hope
some
good
conceit
of
thine
In
thy
soul
s
thought
all
naked
will
bestow
it
Till
whatsoever
star
that
guides
my
moving
Points
on
me
graciously
with
fair
aspect
And
puts
apparel
on
my
tattered
loving
To
show
me
worthy
of
thy
sweet
respect
Then
may
I
dare
to
boast
how
I
do
love
thee
Till
then
not
show
my
head
where
thou
mayst
prove
me
27
Weary
with
toil
I
haste
me
to
my
bed
The
dear
respose
for
limbs
with
travel
tired
But
then
begins
a
journey
in
my
head
To
work
my
mind
when
body
s
work
s
expired
For
then
my
thoughts
from
far
where
I
abide
Intend
a
zealous
pilgrimage
to
thee
And
keep
my
drooping
eyelids
open
wide
Looking
on
darkness
which
the
blind
do
see
Save
that
my
soul
s
imaginary
sight
Presents
thy
shadow
to
my
sightless
view
Which
like
a
jewel
hung
in
ghastly
night
Makes
black
night
beauteous
and
her
old
face
new
Lo
thus
by
day
my
limbs
by
night
my
mind
For
thee
and
for
my
self
no
quiet
find
28
How
can
I
then
return
in
happy
plight
That
am
debarred
the
benefit
of
rest
When
day
s
oppression
is
not
eased
by
night
But
day
by
night
and
night
by
day
oppressed
And
each
though
enemies
to
either
s
reign
Do
in
consent
shake
hands
to
torture
me
The
one
by
toil
the
other
to
complain
How
far
I
toil
still
farther
off
from
thee
I
tell
the
day
to
please
him
thou
art
bright
And
dost
him
grace
when
clouds
do
blot
the
heaven
So
flatter
I
the
swart
complexioned
night
When
sparkling
stars
twire
not
thou
gild
st
the
even
But
day
doth
daily
draw
my
sorrows
longer
And
night
doth
nightly
make
grief
s
length
seem
stronger
29
When
in
disgrace
with
Fortune
and
men
s
eyes
I
all
alone
beweep
my
outcast
state
And
trouble
deaf
heaven
with
my
bootless
cries
And
look
upon
my
self
and
curse
my
fate
Wishing
me
like
to
one
more
rich
in
hope
Featured
like
him
like
him
with
friends
possessed
Desiring
this
man
s
art
and
that
man
s
scope
With
what
I
most
enjoy
contented
least
Yet
in
these
thoughts
my
self
almost
despising
Haply
I
think
on
thee
and
then
my
state
Like
to
the
lark
at
break
of
day
arising
From
sullen
earth
sings
hymns
at
heaven
s
gate
For
thy
sweet
love
remembered
such
wealth
brings
That
then
I
scorn
to
change
my
state
with
kings
30
When
to
the
sessions
of
sweet
silent
thought
I
summon
up
remembrance
of
things
past
I
sigh
the
lack
of
many
a
thing
I
sought
And
with
old
woes
new
wail
my
dear
time
s
waste
Then
can
I
drown
an
eye
unused
to
flow
For
precious
friends
hid
in
death
s
dateless
night
And
weep
afresh
love
s
long
since
cancelled
woe
And
moan
th
expense
of
many
a
vanished
sight
Then
can
I
grieve
at
grievances
foregone
And
heavily
from
woe
to
woe
tell
o
er
The
sad
account
of
fore
bemoaned
moan
Which
I
new
pay
as
if
not
paid
before
But
if
the
while
I
think
on
thee
dear
friend
All
losses
are
restored
and
sorrows
end
31
Thy
bosom
is
endeared
with
all
hearts
Which
I
by
lacking
have
supposed
dead
And
there
reigns
love
and
all
love
s
loving
parts
And
all
those
friends
which
I
thought
buried
How
many
a
holy
and
obsequious
tear
Hath
dear
religious
love
stol
n
from
mine
eye
As
interest
of
the
dead
which
now
appear
But
things
removed
that
hidden
in
thee
lie
Thou
art
the
grave
where
buried
love
doth
live
Hung
with
the
trophies
of
my
lovers
gone
Who
all
their
parts
of
me
to
thee
did
give
That
due
of
many
now
is
thine
alone
Their
images
I
loved
I
view
in
thee
And
thou
all
they
hast
all
the
all
of
me
32
If
thou
survive
my
well
contented
day
When
that
churl
death
my
bones
with
dust
shall
cover
And
shalt
by
fortune
once
more
re
survey
These
poor
rude
lines
of
thy
deceased
lover
Compare
them
with
the
bett
ring
of
the
time
And
though
they
be
outstripped
by
every
pen
Reserve
them
for
my
love
not
for
their
rhyme
Exceeded
by
the
height
of
happier
men
O
then
vouchsafe
me
but
this
loving
thought
Had
my
friend
s
Muse
grown
with
this
growing
age
A
dearer
birth
than
this
his
love
had
brought
To
march
in
ranks
of
better
equipage
But
since
he
died
and
poets
better
prove
Theirs
for
their
style
I
ll
read
his
for
his
love
33
Full
many
a
glorious
morning
have
I
seen
Flatter
the
mountain
tops
with
sovereign
eye
Kissing
with
golden
face
the
meadows
green
Gilding
pale
streams
with
heavenly
alchemy
Anon
permit
the
basest
clouds
to
ride
With
ugly
rack
on
his
celestial
face
And
from
the
forlorn
world
his
visage
hide
Stealing
unseen
to
west
with
this
disgrace
Even
so
my
sun
one
early
morn
did
shine
With
all
triumphant
splendour
on
my
brow
But
out
alack
he
was
but
one
hour
mine
The
region
cloud
hath
masked
him
from
me
now
Yet
him
for
this
my
love
no
whit
disdaineth
Suns
of
the
world
may
stain
when
heaven
s
sun
staineth
34
Why
didst
thou
promise
such
a
beauteous
day
And
make
me
travel
forth
without
my
cloak
To
let
base
clouds
o
ertake
me
in
my
way
Hiding
thy
brav
ry
in
their
rotten
smoke
Tis
not
enough
that
through
the
cloud
thou
break
To
dry
the
rain
on
my
storm
beaten
face
For
no
man
well
of
such
a
salve
can
speak
That
heals
the
wound
and
cures
not
the
disgrace
Nor
can
thy
shame
give
physic
to
my
grief
Though
thou
repent
yet
I
have
still
the
loss
Th
offender
s
sorrow
lends
but
weak
relief
To
him
that
bears
the
strong
offence
s
cross
Ah
but
those
tears
are
pearl
which
thy
love
sheds
And
they
are
rich
and
ransom
all
ill
deeds
35
No
more
be
grieved
at
that
which
thou
hast
done
Roses
have
thorns
and
silver
fountains
mud
Clouds
and
eclipses
stain
both
moon
and
sun
And
loathsome
canker
lives
in
sweetest
bud
All
men
make
faults
and
even
I
in
this
Authorizing
thy
trespass
with
compare
My
self
corrupting
salving
thy
amiss
Excusing
thy
sins
more
than
thy
sins
are
For
to
thy
sensual
fault
I
bring
in
sense
Thy
adverse
party
is
thy
advocate
And
gainst
my
self
a
lawful
plea
commence
Such
civil
war
is
in
my
love
and
hate
That
I
an
accessary
needs
must
be
To
that
sweet
thief
which
sourly
robs
from
me
36
Let
me
confess
that
we
two
must
be
twain
Although
our
undivided
loves
are
one
So
shall
those
blots
that
do
with
me
remain
Without
thy
help
by
me
be
borne
alone
In
our
two
loves
there
is
but
one
respect
Though
in
our
lives
a
separable
spite
Which
though
it
alter
not
love
s
sole
effect
Yet
doth
it
steal
sweet
hours
from
love
s
delight
I
may
not
evermore
acknowledge
thee
Lest
my
bewailed
guilt
should
do
thee
shame
Nor
thou
with
public
kindness
honour
me
Unless
thou
take
that
honour
from
thy
name
But
do
not
so
I
love
thee
in
such
sort
As
thou
being
mine
mine
is
thy
good
report
37
As
a
decrepit
father
takes
delight
To
see
his
active
child
do
deeds
of
youth
So
I
made
lame
by
Fortune
s
dearest
spite
Take
all
my
comfort
of
thy
worth
and
truth
For
whether
beauty
birth
or
wealth
or
wit
Or
any
of
these
all
or
all
or
more
Entitled
in
thy
parts
do
crowned
sit
I
make
my
love
engrafted
to
this
store
So
then
I
am
not
lame
poor
nor
despised
Whilst
that
this
shadow
doth
such
substance
give
That
I
in
thy
abundance
am
sufficed
And
by
a
part
of
all
thy
glory
live
Look
what
is
best
that
best
I
wish
in
thee
This
wish
I
have
then
ten
times
happy
me
38
How
can
my
muse
want
subject
to
invent
While
thou
dost
breathe
that
pour
st
into
my
verse
Thine
own
sweet
argument
too
excellent
For
every
vulgar
paper
to
rehearse
O
give
thy
self
the
thanks
if
aught
in
me
Worthy
perusal
stand
against
thy
sight
For
who
s
so
dumb
that
cannot
write
to
thee
When
thou
thy
self
dost
give
invention
light
Be
thou
the
tenth
Muse
ten
times
more
in
worth
Than
those
old
nine
which
rhymers
invocate
And
he
that
calls
on
thee
let
him
bring
forth
Eternal
numbers
to
outlive
long
date
If
my
slight
muse
do
please
these
curious
days
The
pain
be
mine
but
thine
shall
be
the
praise
39
O
how
thy
worth
with
manners
may
I
sing
When
thou
art
all
the
better
part
of
me
What
can
mine
own
praise
to
mine
own
self
bring
And
what
is
t
but
mine
own
when
I
praise
thee
Even
for
this
let
us
divided
live
And
our
dear
love
lose
name
of
single
one
That
by
this
separation
I
may
give
That
due
to
thee
which
thou
deserv
st
alone
O
absence
what
a
torment
wouldst
thou
prove
Were
it
not
thy
sour
leisure
gave
sweet
leave
To
entertain
the
time
with
thoughts
of
love
Which
time
and
thoughts
so
sweetly
doth
deceive
And
that
thou
teachest
how
to
make
one
twain
By
praising
him
here
who
doth
hence
remain
40
Take
all
my
loves
my
love
yea
take
them
all
What
hast
thou
then
more
than
thou
hadst
before
No
love
my
love
that
thou
mayst
true
love
call
All
mine
was
thine
before
thou
hadst
this
more
Then
if
for
my
love
thou
my
love
receivest
I
cannot
blame
thee
for
my
love
thou
usest
But
yet
be
blamed
if
thou
thy
self
deceivest
By
wilful
taste
of
what
thy
self
refusest
I
do
forgive
thy
robbery
gentle
thief
Although
thou
steal
thee
all
my
poverty
And
yet
love
knows
it
is
a
greater
grief
To
bear
greater
wrong
than
hate
s
known
injury
Lascivious
grace
in
whom
all
ill
well
shows
Kill
me
with
spites
yet
we
must
not
be
foes
41
Those
pretty
wrongs
that
liberty
commits
When
I
am
sometime
absent
from
thy
heart
Thy
beauty
and
thy
years
full
well
befits
For
still
temptation
follows
where
thou
art
Gentle
thou
art
and
therefore
to
be
won
Beauteous
thou
art
therefore
to
be
assailed
And
when
a
woman
woos
what
woman
s
son
Will
sourly
leave
her
till
he
have
prevailed
Ay
me
but
yet
thou
mightst
my
seat
forbear
And
chide
thy
beauty
and
thy
straying
youth
Who
lead
thee
in
their
riot
even
there
Where
thou
art
forced
to
break
a
twofold
truth
Hers
by
thy
beauty
tempting
her
to
thee
Thine
by
thy
beauty
being
false
to
me
42
That
thou
hast
her
it
is
not
all
my
grief
And
yet
it
may
be
said
I
loved
her
dearly
That
she
hath
thee
is
of
my
wailing
chief
A
loss
in
love
that
touches
me
more
nearly
Loving
offenders
thus
I
will
excuse
ye
Thou
dost
love
her
because
thou
know
st
I
love
her
And
for
my
sake
even
so
doth
she
abuse
me
Suff
ring
my
friend
for
my
sake
to
approve
her
If
I
lose
thee
my
loss
is
my
love
s
gain
And
losing
her
my
friend
hath
found
that
loss
Both
find
each
other
and
I
lose
both
twain
And
both
for
my
sake
lay
on
me
this
cross
But
here
s
the
joy
my
friend
and
I
are
one
Sweet
flattery
then
she
loves
but
me
alone
43
When
most
I
wink
then
do
mine
eyes
best
see
For
all
the
day
they
view
things
unrespected
But
when
I
sleep
in
dreams
they
look
on
thee
And
darkly
bright
are
bright
in
dark
directed
Then
thou
whose
shadow
shadows
doth
make
bright
How
would
thy
shadow
s
form
form
happy
show
To
the
clear
day
with
thy
much
clearer
light
When
to
unseeing
eyes
thy
shade
shines
so
How
would
I
say
mine
eyes
be
blessed
made
By
looking
on
thee
in
the
living
day
When
in
dead
night
thy
fair
imperfect
shade
Through
heavy
sleep
on
sightless
eyes
doth
stay
All
days
are
nights
to
see
till
I
see
thee
And
nights
bright
days
when
dreams
do
show
thee
me
44
If
the
dull
substance
of
my
flesh
were
thought
Injurious
distance
should
not
stop
my
way
For
then
despite
of
space
I
would
be
brought
From
limits
far
remote
where
thou
dost
stay
No
matter
then
although
my
foot
did
stand
Upon
the
farthest
earth
removed
from
thee
For
nimble
thought
can
jump
both
sea
and
land
As
soon
as
think
the
place
where
he
would
be
But
ah
thought
kills
me
that
I
am
not
thought
To
leap
large
lengths
of
miles
when
thou
art
gone
But
that
so
much
of
earth
and
water
wrought
I
must
attend
time
s
leisure
with
my
moan
Receiving
nought
by
elements
so
slow
But
heavy
tears
badges
of
either
s
woe
45
The
other
two
slight
air
and
purging
fire
Are
both
with
thee
wherever
I
abide
The
first
my
thought
the
other
my
desire
These
present
absent
with
swift
motion
slide
For
when
these
quicker
elements
are
gone
In
tender
embassy
of
love
to
thee
My
life
being
made
of
four
with
two
alone
Sinks
down
to
death
oppressed
with
melancholy
Until
life
s
composition
be
recured
By
those
swift
messengers
returned
from
thee
Who
even
but
now
come
back
again
assured
Of
thy
fair
health
recounting
it
to
me
This
told
I
joy
but
then
no
longer
glad
I
send
them
back
again
and
straight
grow
sad
46
Mine
eye
and
heart
are
at
a
mortal
war
How
to
divide
the
conquest
of
thy
sight
Mine
eye
my
heart
thy
picture
s
sight
would
bar
My
heart
mine
eye
the
freedom
of
that
right
My
heart
doth
plead
that
thou
in
him
dost
lie
A
closet
never
pierced
with
crystal
eyes
But
the
defendant
doth
that
plea
deny
And
says
in
him
thy
fair
appearance
lies
To
side
this
title
is
impanelled
A
quest
of
thoughts
all
tenants
to
the
heart
And
by
their
verdict
is
determined
The
clear
eye
s
moiety
and
the
dear
heart
s
part
As
thus
mine
eye
s
due
is
thy
outward
part
And
my
heart
s
right
thy
inward
love
of
heart
47
Betwixt
mine
eye
and
heart
a
league
is
took
And
each
doth
good
turns
now
unto
the
other
When
that
mine
eye
is
famished
for
a
look
Or
heart
in
love
with
sighs
himself
doth
smother
With
my
love
s
picture
then
my
eye
doth
feast
And
to
the
painted
banquet
bids
my
heart
Another
time
mine
eye
is
my
heart
s
guest
And
in
his
thoughts
of
love
doth
share
a
part
So
either
by
thy
picture
or
my
love
Thy
self
away
art
present
still
with
me
For
thou
not
farther
than
my
thoughts
canst
move
And
I
am
still
with
them
and
they
with
thee
Or
if
they
sleep
thy
picture
in
my
sight
Awakes
my
heart
to
heart
s
and
eye
s
delight
48
How
careful
was
I
when
I
took
my
way
Each
trifle
under
truest
bars
to
thrust
That
to
my
use
it
might
unused
stay
From
hands
of
falsehood
in
sure
wards
of
trust
But
thou
to
whom
my
jewels
trifles
are
Most
worthy
comfort
now
my
greatest
grief
Thou
best
of
dearest
and
mine
only
care
Art
left
the
prey
of
every
vulgar
thief
Thee
have
I
not
locked
up
in
any
chest
Save
where
thou
art
not
though
I
feel
thou
art
Within
the
gentle
closure
of
my
breast
From
whence
at
pleasure
thou
mayst
come
and
part
And
even
thence
thou
wilt
be
stol
n
I
fear
For
truth
proves
thievish
for
a
prize
so
dear
49
Against
that
time
if
ever
that
time
come
When
I
shall
see
thee
frown
on
my
defects
When
as
thy
love
hath
cast
his
utmost
sum
Called
to
that
audit
by
advised
respects
Against
that
time
when
thou
shalt
strangely
pass
And
scarcely
greet
me
with
that
sun
thine
eye
When
love
converted
from
the
thing
it
was
Shall
reasons
find
of
settled
gravity
Against
that
time
do
I
ensconce
me
here
Within
the
knowledge
of
mine
own
desert
And
this
my
hand
against
my
self
uprear
To
guard
the
lawful
reasons
on
thy
part
To
leave
poor
me
thou
hast
the
strength
of
laws
Since
why
to
love
I
can
allege
no
cause
50
How
heavy
do
I
journey
on
the
way
When
what
I
seek
my
weary
travel
s
end
Doth
teach
that
case
and
that
repose
to
say
Thus
far
the
miles
are
measured
from
thy
friend
The
beast
that
bears
me
tired
with
my
woe
Plods
dully
on
to
bear
that
weight
in
me
As
if
by
some
instinct
the
wretch
did
know
His
rider
loved
not
speed
being
made
from
thee
The
bloody
spur
cannot
provoke
him
on
That
sometimes
anger
thrusts
into
his
hide
Which
heavily
he
answers
with
a
groan
More
sharp
to
me
than
spurring
to
his
side
For
that
same
groan
doth
put
this
in
my
mind
My
grief
lies
onward
and
my
joy
behind
51
Thus
can
my
love
excuse
the
slow
offence
Of
my
dull
bearer
when
from
thee
I
speed
From
where
thou
art
why
should
I
haste
me
thence
Till
I
return
of
posting
is
no
need
O
what
excuse
will
my
poor
beast
then
find
When
swift
extremity
can
seem
but
slow
Then
should
I
spur
though
mounted
on
the
wind
In
winged
speed
no
motion
shall
I
know
Then
can
no
horse
with
my
desire
keep
pace
Therefore
desire
of
perfect
st
love
being
made
Shall
neigh
no
dull
flesh
in
his
fiery
race
But
love
for
love
thus
shall
excuse
my
jade
Since
from
thee
going
he
went
wilful
slow
Towards
thee
I
ll
run
and
give
him
leave
to
go
52
So
am
I
as
the
rich
whose
blessed
key
Can
bring
him
to
his
sweet
up
locked
treasure
The
which
he
will
not
every
hour
survey
For
blunting
the
fine
point
of
seldom
pleasure
Therefore
are
feasts
so
solemn
and
so
rare
Since
seldom
coming
in
that
long
year
set
Like
stones
of
worth
they
thinly
placed
are
Or
captain
jewels
in
the
carcanet
So
is
the
time
that
keeps
you
as
my
chest
Or
as
the
wardrobe
which
the
robe
doth
hide
To
make
some
special
instant
special
blest
By
new
unfolding
his
imprisoned
pride
Blessed
are
you
whose
worthiness
gives
scope
Being
had
to
triumph
being
lacked
to
hope
53
What
is
your
substance
whereof
are
you
made
That
millions
of
strange
shadows
on
you
tend
Since
every
one
hath
every
one
one
shade
And
you
but
one
can
every
shadow
lend
Describe
Adonis
and
the
counterfeit
Is
poorly
imitated
after
you
On
Helen
s
cheek
all
art
of
beauty
set
And
you
in
Grecian
tires
are
painted
new
Speak
of
the
spring
and
foison
of
the
year
The
one
doth
shadow
of
your
beauty
show
The
other
as
your
bounty
doth
appear
And
you
in
every
blessed
shape
we
know
In
all
external
grace
you
have
some
part
But
you
like
none
none
you
for
constant
heart
54
O
how
much
more
doth
beauty
beauteous
seem
By
that
sweet
ornament
which
truth
doth
give
The
rose
looks
fair
but
fairer
we
it
deem
For
that
sweet
odour
which
doth
in
it
live
The
canker
blooms
have
full
as
deep
a
dye
As
the
perfumed
tincture
of
the
roses
Hang
on
such
thorns
and
play
as
wantonly
When
summer
s
breath
their
masked
buds
discloses
