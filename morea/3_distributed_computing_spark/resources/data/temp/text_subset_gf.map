Let
nobody
blame
him
his

I
approve
Nay

Hark
who

I

Sing

willow
If
I
court
moe
women
you
ll
couch
with
moe
men
So
get
thee
gone
good
night
Mine
eyes
do
itch
Doth
that
bode
weeping
EMILIA
Tis
neither
here
nor
there
DESDEMONA
I
have
heard
it
said
so
O
these
men
these
men
Dost
thou
in
conscience
think
tell
me
Emilia
That
there
be
women
do
abuse
their
husbands
In
such
gross
kind
EMILIA
There
be
some
such
no
question
DESDEMONA
Wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
EMILIA
Why
would
not
you
DESDEMONA
No
by
this
heavenly
light
EMILIA
Nor
I
neither
by
this
heavenly
light
I
might
do
t
as
well
i
the
dark
DESDEMONA
Wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
EMILIA
The
world
s
a
huge
thing
it
is
a
great
price
For
a
small
vice
DESDEMONA
In
troth
I
think
thou
wouldst
not
EMILIA
In
troth
I
think
I
should
and
undo
t
when
I
had
done
Marry
I
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
a
joint
ring
nor
for
measures
of
lawn
nor
for
gowns
petticoats
nor
caps
nor
any
petty
exhibition
but
for
the
whole
world
why
who
would
not
make
her
husband
a
cuckold
to
make
him
a
monarch
I
should
venture
purgatory
for
t
DESDEMONA
Beshrew
me
if
I
would
do
such
a
wrong
For
the
whole
world
EMILIA
Why
the
wrong
is
but
a
wrong
i
the
world
and
having
the
world
for
your
labor
tis
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
DESDEMONA
I
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
EMILIA
Yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
But
I
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
If
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
And
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
Or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
Throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
Or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
Why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
Yet
have
we
some
revenge
Let
husbands
know
Their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
And
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
As
husbands
have
What
is
it
that
they
do
When
they
change
us
for
others
Is
it
sport
I
think
it
is
And
doth
affection
breed
it
I
think
it
doth
Is
t
frailty
that
thus
errs
It
is
so
too
And
have
not
we
affections
Desires
for
sport
and
frailty
as
men
have
Then
let
them
use
us
well
else
let
them
know
The
ills
we
do
their
ills
instruct
us
so
DESDEMONA
Good
night
good
night
Heaven
me
such
uses
send
Not
to
pick
bad
from
bad
but

bad

rubb
d

Every

gain
Live
Roderigo
He
calls
me
to
a
restitution
large
Of

As

Desdemona
It

If

a
daily
beauty
in
his
life
That
makes
me
ugly
and

Moor
May
unfold

Desdemona

light

Enter
Othello
OTHELLO
It
is
the
cause
it
is
the
cause
my
soul
Let
me
not
name
it
to
you
you
chaste
stars
It
is
the
cause
Yet
I
ll
not
shed
her
blood
Nor
scar
that
whiter
skin
of
hers
than
snow
And
smooth
as
monumental
alabaster
Yet
she
must
die
else
she
ll
betray
more
men
Put
out
the
light
and
then
put
out
the
light
If
I
quench
thee
thou
flaming
minister
I
can
again
thy
former
light
restore
Should
I
repent
me
but
once
put
out
thy
light
Thou
cunning
st
pattern
of
excelling
nature
I
know
not
where
is
that
Promethean
heat
That
can
thy
light
relume
When
I
have
pluck
d
the
rose
I
cannot
give
it
vital
growth
again
It
must
needs
wither
I
ll
smell
it
on
the
tree
Kisses
her
O
balmy
breath
that
dost
almost
persuade
Justice
to
break
her
sword
One
more
one
more
Be
thus
when
thou
art
dead
and
I
will
kill
thee
And
love
thee
after
One
more
and
this
the
last
So
sweet
was
ne
er
so
fatal
I
must
weep
But
they
are
cruel
tears
this
sorrow

It
strikes
where
it
doth

She
wakes
DESDEMONA
Who

Othello
OTHELLO
Ay
Desdemona
DESDEMONA
Will
you
come
to
bed
my
lord
OTHELLO
Have
you
pray
d
tonight
Desdemona
DESDEMONA
Ay
my
lord
OTHELLO
If
you
bethink
yourself
of
any
crime
Unreconciled
as
yet
to
heaven
and
grace
Solicit
for
it
straight
DESDEMONA
Alas
my
lord
what
may
you
mean
by
that
OTHELLO
Well
do
it
and
be
brief
I
will
walk
by
I
would
not
kill
thy
unprepared
spirit
No
heaven
forfend
I
would
not
kill
thy
soul
DESDEMONA
Talk
you
of
killing
OTHELLO
Ay
I
do
DESDEMONA
Then
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
OTHELLO
Amen
with
all
my
heart
DESDEMONA
If
you
say
so
I
hope
you
will
not
kill
me
OTHELLO
Hum
DESDEMONA
And
yet
I
fear
you
for
you
are
fatal
then
When
your
eyes
roll
so
Why
I
should
fear
I
know
not
Since
guiltiness
I
know
not
but
yet
I
feel
I
fear
OTHELLO
Think
on
thy
sins
DESDEMONA
They
are
loves
I
bear
to
you
OTHELLO
Ay
and
for
that
thou
diest
DESDEMONA
That
death
s
unnatural
that
kills
for
loving
Alas
why
gnaw
you
so
your
nether
lip
Some
bloody
passion
shakes
your
very
frame
These
are
portents
but
yet
I
hope
I
hope
They
do
not
point
on
me
OTHELLO
Peace
and
be
still
DESDEMONA
I
will
so
What
s
the
matter
OTHELLO
That
handkerchief
which
I
so
loved
and
gave
thee
Thou
gavest
to
Cassio
DESDEMONA
No
by
my
life
and
soul
Send
for
the
man
and
ask
him
OTHELLO
Sweet
soul
take
heed
Take
heed
of
perjury
thou
are
on
thy
deathbed
DESDEMONA
Ay
but
not
yet
to
die
OTHELLO
Yes
presently
Therefore
confess
thee
freely
of
thy
sin
For
to
deny
each
article
with
oath
Cannot
remove
nor
choke
the
strong
conception
That
I
do
groan
withal
Thou
art
to
die
DESDEMONA
Then
Lord
have
mercy
on
me
OTHELLO
I
say
amen
DESDEMONA
And
have
you
mercy
too
I
never
did
Offend
you
in
my
life
never
loved
Cassio
But
with
such
general
warranty
of
heaven
As
I
might
love
I
never
gave
him
token
OTHELLO
By
heaven
I
saw
my
handkerchief
in
s
hand
O
perjured
woman
Thou
dost
stone
my
heart
And
makest
me
call
what
I
intend
to
do
A
murther
which
I
thought
a
sacrifice
I
saw
the
handkerchief
DESDEMONA
He
found
it
then
I
never
gave
it
him
Send
for
him
hither
Let
him
confess
a
truth
OTHELLO
He
hath
confess
d
DESDEMONA
What
my
lord
OTHELLO
That

used
thee
DESDEMONA
How

OTHELLO
Yes

Still

Shall

My

What

O
insupportable
O
heavy

eclipse
Of
sun

moon

that
the
affrighted
globe
Should
yawn
at
alteration
EMILIA
