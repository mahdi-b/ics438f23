Make
forth
the
generals
would
have
some
words
OCTAVIUS
Stir
not
until
the
signal
not
until
the
signal
BRUTUS
Words
before
blows
Is
it
so
countrymen
OCTAVIUS
Not
that
we
love
words
better
as
you
do
BRUTUS
Good
words
are
better
than
bad
strokes
Octavius
ANTONY
In
your
bad
strokes
Brutus
you
give
good
words
Witness
the
hole
you
made
in
Caesar
s
heart
Crying
Long
live
Hail
Caesar
CASSIUS
Antony
The
posture
of
your
blows
are
yet
unknown
But
for
your
words
they
rob
the
Hybla
bees
And
leave
them
honeyless
ANTONY
Not
stingless
too
BRUTUS
O
yes
and
soundless
too
For
you
have
stol
n
their
buzzing
Antony
And
very
wisely
threat
before
you
sting
ANTONY
Villains
You
did
not
so
when
your
vile
daggers
Hack
d
one
another
in
the
sides
of
Caesar
You
show
d
your
teeth
like
apes
and
fawn
d
like
hounds
And
bow
d
like
bondmen
kissing
Caesar
s
feet
Whilst
damned
Casca
like
a
cur
behind
Strooke
Caesar
on
the
neck
O
you
flatterers
CASSIUS
Flatterers
Now
Brutus
thank
yourself
This
tongue
had
not
offended
so
today
If
Cassius
might
have
ruled
OCTAVIUS
Come
come
the
cause
If
arguing
make
us
sweat
The
proof
of
it
will
turn
to
redder
drops
Look
I
draw
a
sword
against
conspirators
When
think
you
that
the
sword
goes
up
again
Never
till
Caesar
s
three
and
thirty
wounds
Be
well
avenged
or
till
another
Caesar
Have
added
slaughter
to
the
sword
of
traitors
BRUTUS
Caesar
thou
canst
not
die
by
traitors
hands
Unless
thou
bring
st
them
with
thee
OCTAVIUS
So
I
hope
I
was
not
born
to
die
on
Brutus
sword
BRUTUS
O
if
thou
wert
the
noblest
of
thy
strain
Young
man
thou
couldst
not
die
more
honorable
CASSIUS
A
peevish
school
boy
worthless
of
such
honor
Join
d
with
a
masker
and
a
reveler
ANTONY
Old
Cassius
still
OCTAVIUS
Come
Antony
away
Defiance
traitors
hurl
we
in
your
teeth
If
you
dare
fight
today
come
to
the
field
If
not
when
you
have
stomachs
Exeunt
Octavius
Antony
and
their
Army
CASSIUS
Why
now
blow
and
swell
billow
and
swim
bark
The
storm
is
up
and
all
is
on
the
hazard
BRUTUS
Ho
Lucilius
Hark
a
word
with
you
LUCILIUS
Stands
forth
My
lord
Brutus
and
Lucilius
converse
apart
CASSIUS
Messala
MESSALA
Stands
forth
What
says
my
general
CASSIUS
Messala
This
is
my
birthday
as
this
very
day
Was
Cassius
born
Give
me
thy
hand
Messala
Be
thou
my
witness
that
against
my
will
As
Pompey
was
am
I
compell
d
to
set
Upon
one
battle
all
our
liberties
You
know
that
I
held
Epicurus
strong
And
his
opinion
Now
I
change
my
mind
And
partly
credit
things
that
do
presage
Coming
from
Sardis
on
our
former
ensign
Two
mighty
eagles
fell
and
there
they
perch
d
Gorging
and
feeding
from
our
soldiers
hands
Who
to
Philippi
here
consorted
us
This
morning
are
they
fled
away
and
gone
And
in
their
steads
do
ravens
crows
and
kites
Fly
o
er
our
heads
and
downward
look
on
us
As
we
were
sickly
prey
Their
shadows
seem
A
canopy
most
fatal
under
which
Our
army
lies
ready
to
give
up
the
ghost
MESSALA
Believe
not
so
CASSIUS
I
but
believe
it
partly
For
I
am
fresh
of
spirit
and
resolved
To
meet
all
perils
very
constantly
BRUTUS
Even
so
Lucilius
CASSIUS
Now
most
noble
Brutus
The
gods
today
stand
friendly
that
we
may
Lovers
in
peace
lead
on
our
days
to
age
But
since
the
affairs
of
men
rest
still
incertain
Let
s
reason
with
the
worst
that
may
befall
If
we
do
lose
this
battle
then
is
this
The
very
last
time
we
shall
speak
together
What
are
you
then
determined
to
do
BRUTUS
Even
by
the
rule
of
that
philosophy
By
which
I
did
blame
Cato
for
the
death
Which
he
did
give
himself
I
know
not
how
But
I
do
find
it
cowardly
and
vile
For
fear
of
what
might
fall
so
to
prevent
The
time
of
life
arming
myself
with
patience
To
stay
the
providence
of
some
high
powers
That
govern
us
below
CASSIUS
Then
if
we
lose
this
battle
You
are
contented
to
be
led
in
triumph
Thorough
the
streets
of
Rome
BRUTUS
No
Cassius
no
Think
not
thou
noble
Roman
That
ever
Brutus
will
go
bound
to
Rome
He
bears
too
great
a
mind
But
this
same
day
Must
end
that
work
the
ides
of
March
begun
And
whether
we
shall
meet
again
I
know
not
Therefore
our
everlasting
farewell
take
Forever
and
forever
farewell
Cassius
If
we
do
meet
again
why
we
shall
smile
If
not
why
then
this
parting
was
well
made
CASSIUS
Forever
and
forever
farewell
Brutus
If
we
do
meet
again
we
ll
smile
indeed
If
not
tis
true
this
parting
was
well
made
BRUTUS
Why
then
lead
on
O
that
a
man
might
know
The
end
of
this
day
s
business
ere
it
come
But
it
sufficeth
that
the
day
will
end
And
then
the
end
is
known
Come

This

mine
was
turning
back
I
slew
the
coward
and
did
take
it
from
him
TITINIUS
O
Cassius
Brutus
gave
the
word
too
early
Who
having
some
advantage
on
Octavius
Took
it
too
eagerly
His
soldiers
fell
to

Whilst

Till

And

Whether

Exit

With

Yet

To

Come
hither
sirrah
In
Parthia
did
I
take
thee
prisoner
And
then
I
swore
thee
saving
of
thy
life
That
whatsoever
I
did
bid
thee
do
Thou
shouldst
attempt
it
Come
now
keep
thine
oath
Now
be

freeman

with
this
good
sword
That
ran
through
Caesar

bowels
search

Stand

And

PINDARUS
So

Durst

MESSALA
It

Octavius
Is
overthrown

As
Cassius

Antony
TITINIUS
These

would
well
comfort
Cassius
MESSALA
Where
did
you
leave
him
TITINIUS
All
disconsolate
With
Pindarus
his
bondman
on
this
hill
MESSALA
Is
not
that
he
that
lies
upon

TITINIUS
He
lies

the
living
O
my
heart
MESSALA
Is
not

TITINIUS
No

he
Messala
But
Cassius
is
no
more
O
setting
sun
As
in
thy
red
rays
thou
dost
sink
to
night
So
in
his
red

Cassius

The

Clouds

Mistrust

O

Why
dost

show
to
the
apt

The
things

O
error

conceived
Thou
never
comest

But

thee
TITINIUS

Where

Seek
him
Titinius
whilst

The
noble
Brutus
thrusting
this
report
Into
his
ears
I
may
say
thrusting
it
For
piercing
steel
and
darts
envenomed
Shall
be
as
welcome
to
the
ears
of
Brutus
As
tidings
of
this
sight
TITINIUS
Hie
you
Messala
And
I
will
seek
for
Pindarus
the
while
Exit
Messala
Why
didst
thou
send
me
forth
brave
Cassius
Did
I
not
meet
thy
friends
And
did
not
they
Put
on
my
brows
this
wreath
of
victory
And
bid
me
give
it
thee
Didst
thou
not
hear
their
shouts
Alas
thou
hast
misconstrued
everything
But
hold
thee
take
this
garland
on
thy
brow
Thy
Brutus
bid
me
give
it
thee

I
Will
do
his
bidding

What

that
MESSALA
My
master
s
man
Strato
where
is
thy
master
STRATO
Free
from
the
bondage
you
are
in
Messala
The
conquerors
can
but
make
a
fire
of
him
For
Brutus
only
overcame
himself
And
no
man
else
hath
honor
by
his
death
LUCILIUS
So
Brutus
should
be
found
I
thank
thee
Brutus
That
thou
hast
proved
Lucilius

OCTAVIUS
All

served
Brutus
I

How

STRATO
I
held
the

he
did
run
on

MESSALA
Octavius
then
take
him
to
follow
thee
That
did
the
latest
service
to
my
master
ANTONY
This
was
the
noblest
Roman
of
them
all
All
the
conspirators
save
only
he
Did
that
they
did
in
envy
of
great
Caesar
He
only
in
a
general
honest
thought
And
common
good
to
all
made
one
of
them
His
life
was
gentle
and
the
elements
So
mix
d
in
him
that
Nature
might
stand
up
And
say
to
all
the
world
This
was
a
man
OCTAVIUS
According
to
his
virtue
let
us
use
him
With
all
respect
and
rites
of
burial
Within
my
tent
his
bones
tonight
shall
lie
Most
like
a
soldier
ordered
honorably
So
call
the
field
to
rest
and
let
s
away
To
part
the
glories
of
this
happy
day

more
affected
the

Cornwall

It
did
always
seem

now
in

it

not
which

But
I
have
sir
a
son
by
order
of
law
some
year
elder
than
this
who
yet
is
no
dearer
in
my
account
Though
this
knave
came
something
saucily
into
the
world
before
he
was
sent
for
yet
was
his
mother
fair

was
good
sport
