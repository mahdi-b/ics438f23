shallow
jesters
and
rash
bavin
wits
Soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
Mingled
his
royalty
with
cap
ring
fools
Had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
And
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
To
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
Of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
Grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
Enfeoff
d
himself
to
popularity
That
being
dally
swallowed
by
men
s
eyes
They
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
To
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
More
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
So
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
He
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
June
Heard
not
regarded
seen
but
with
such
eyes
As
sick
and
blunted
with
community
Afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
Such
as
is
bent
on
unlike
majesty
When
it
shines
seldom
in
admiring
eyes
But
rather
drows
d
and
hung
their
eyelids
down
Slept
in
his
face
and
rend
red
such
aspect
As
cloudy
men
use
to
their
adversaries
Being
with
his
presence
glutted
gorg
d
and
full
And
in
that
very
line
Harry
standest
thou
For
thou
hast
lost
thy
princely
privilege
With
vile
participation
Not
an
eye
But
is
aweary
of
thy
common
sight
Save
mine
which
hath
desir
d
to
see
thee
more
Which
now
doth
that
I
would
not
have
it
do
Make
blind
itself
with
foolish
tenderness
Prince
I
shall
hereafter
my
thrice
gracious
lord
Be
more
myself
King
For
all
the
world
As
thou
art
to
this
hour
was
Richard
then
When
I
from
France
set
foot
at
Ravenspurgh
And
even
as
I
was
then
is
Percy
now
Now
by
my
sceptre
and
my
soul
to
boot
He
hath
more
worthy
interest
to
the
state
Than
thou
the
shadow
of
succession
For
of
no
right
nor
colour
like
to
right
He
doth
fill
fields
with
harness
in

Turns
head
against

armed
jaws
And
Being
no
more
in

than
thou
Leads
ancient
lords
and
reverend
Bishops
on
To
bloody
battles
and
to
bruising
arms
What
never
dying
honour
hath
he
got
Against
renowmed
Douglas
whose
high
deeds
Whose
hot
incursions
and
great
name
in

Holds
from
all
soldiers
chief
majority
And
military

Through
all
the

Thrice

this

This
infant
warrior
in
his
enterprises
Discomfited
great
Douglas
ta

him

Enlarged

To

Why

of
my

Which
art
my
nearest

dearest
enemy
Thou
that
art
like

through

fear
Base
inclination
and
the
start
of
spleen
To
fight
against
me
under
Percy

To
dog
his

curtsy
at

To

I
will
redeem
all

And
in

closing
of

Be
bold

tell
you

I
am
your

When
I
will
wear
a
garment
all
of

And
stain
my
favours
in
a
bloody

Which

And

Percy

To

Scene
I
The
rebel
camp
near
Shrewsbury
Enter
Harry
Hotspur
Worcester
and
Douglas
Hot
Well
said
my
noble
Scot
If
speaking
truth
In
this
fine
age
were
not
thought
flattery
Such
attribution
should
the
Douglas
have
As
not
a
soldier
of
this
season
s
stamp
Should
go
so
general
current
through
the
world
By
God
I
cannot
flatter
I
defy
The
tongues
of
soothers
but
a
braver
place
In
my
heart
s
love
hath
no
man
than
yourself
Nay
task
me
to
my
word
approve
me
lord
Doug
Thou
art
the
king
of
honour
No
man
so
potent
breathes
upon
the
ground
But
I
will
beard
him
Enter
one
with
letters
Hot
Do
so
and
tis
well
What
letters
hast
thou
there
I
can
but
thank
you
Messenger
These
letters
come
from
your
father
Hot
Letters
from
him
Why
comes
he
not
himself
Mess
He
cannot
come
my
lord
he
is
grievous
sick
Hot
Zounds
how
has
he
the
leisure
to
be
sick
In
such
a
justling
time
Who
leads
his
power
Under
whose
government
come
they
along
Mess
His
letters
bears
his
mind
not
I
my
lord
Wor
I
prithee
tell
me
doth
he
keep
his
bed
Mess
He
did
my
lord
four
days
ere
I
set
forth
And
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
He
was
much
fear
d
by
his
physicians
Wor
I
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
Ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
His
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
Hot
Sick
now
droop
now
This
sickness
doth
infect
The
very
lifeblood
of
our
enterprise
Tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
He
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
And
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
So
soon
be
drawn
no
did
he
think
it
meet
To
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
On
any
soul
remov
d
but
on
his
own
Yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
That
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
To
see
how
fortune
is
dispos
d
to
us
For
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
Because
the
King
is
certainly
possess
d
Of
all
our
purposes
What
say
you
to
it
Wor
Your
father
s
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
Hot
A
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
lopp
d
off
And
yet
in
faith
it
is
not
His
present
want
Seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
Were
it
good
To
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
All
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
man
On
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
It
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
The
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
The
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
Of
all
our
fortunes
Doug
Faith
and
so
we
should
Where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
We
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
Is
to
come
in
A
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
Hot
A
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
If
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
Upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
Wor
But
yet
I
would
your
father
had
been
here
The
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
Brooks
no
division
It
will
be
thought
By
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
That
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
Of
our
proceedings
kept
the
Earl
from
hence
And
think
how
such
an
apprehension
May
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
And
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
For
well
you
know
we
of
the
off
ring
side
Must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
And
stop
all
sight
holes
every
loop
from
whence
The
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
This
absence
of
your
father
s
draws
a
curtain
That
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
Before
not
dreamt
of
Hot
You
strain
too
far
I
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
It
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
A
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
Than
if
the
Earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
If
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
To
push
against
a
kingdom
with
his
help
We
shall
o
erturn
it
topsy
turvy
down
Yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints
are
whole

heart
can

There
is

Wanton

Rise

If

the
King

press
damnably
I
have
got
in

a
hundred
and
fifty
soldiers
three
hundred

odd
pounds
I
press

no
bigger

such

I
to

that
I

hundred

fifty
tattered
Prodigals
