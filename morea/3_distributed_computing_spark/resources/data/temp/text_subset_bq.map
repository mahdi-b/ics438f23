LORD
I

No

for

But

The
King

Of
his

destitute

broken
And

Through

Lolling

More

Some

To

LORD
Where

Close

So

In

Athwart

The

With

fairer
Than

POSTHUMUS
Over

POSTHUMUS
So
if
I
prove
a
good
repast
to
the
spectators
the
dish
pays
the
shot
GAOLER
A
heavy
reckoning
for
you
sir
But
the
comfort
is
you
shall
be
called
to
no
more
payments
fear
no
more
tavern
bills
which
are
often
the
sadness
of
parting
as
the
procuring
of
mirth
You
come
in
faint
for
want
of
meat
depart
reeling
with
too
much
drink
sorry
that
you
have
paid
too
much
and
sorry
that
you
are
paid
too
much
purse
and
brain
both
empty
the
brain
the
heavier
for
being
too
light
the

too
light
being
drawn

O
of
this
contradiction
you
shall
now
be
quit
O
the
charity
of
a
penny
cord
It
sums
up
thousands
in
a
trice
You
have
no
true
debitor
and
creditor
but
it
of
what
s
past
is
and
to
come
the
discharge
Your
neck
sir
is
pen
book

merrier

Indeed
sir
he
that

feels
not
the
toothache
But
a
man
that
were
to
sleep
your
sleep
and
a
hangman
to
help
him
to
bed
I
think
he
would
change
places
with
his
officer
for

you
sir
you

not
which
way
you
shall
go
POSTHUMUS
Yes
indeed

I
fellow
GAOLER
Your

has
eyes
in

You
must
either
be
directed
by
some
that
take
upon

to
know

to
take
upon
yourself
that
which
I
am
sure
you
do
not
know
or
jump

after
inquiry
on

And
how
you

I

you

POSTHUMUS
I
tell
thee
fellow
there
are
none
want
eyes
to
direct
them
the
way
I
am
going
but
such
as
wink
and
will
not

them
GAOLER
What
an
infinite
mock
is
this
that
a
man
should
have
the
best
use
of
eyes
to
see
the
way
of
blindness
I
am

hanging
