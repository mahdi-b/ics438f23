Splitted
the

This
is
his
sword
I
robb
d
his
wound
of
it
behold
it

d
With
his
most
noble
blood
CAESAR
Look
you
sad
friends
The
gods
rebuke
me
but
it
is
tidings
To
wash
the
eyes
of
kings
AGRIPPA
And
strange
it
is
That
nature
must
compel
us
to
lament
Our
most
persisted
deeds
MAECENAS
His
taints
and
honours
Wag
d
equal
with
him
AGRIPPA
A
rarer
spirit
never
Did
steer
humanity
But
you
gods
will
give
us
Some
faults
to
make
us
men
Caesar
is
touch
d
MAECENAS
When
such
a
spacious
mirror
s
set
before
him
He
needs
must
see
himself
CAESAR
O
Antony
I
have
follow
d
thee
to
this
But
we
do
lance
Diseases
in
our
bodies
I
must
perforce
Have
shown
to
thee
such
a
declining
day
Or
look
on
thine
we
could
not
stall
together
In
the
whole
world
But
yet
let
me
lament
With
tears
as
sovereign
as
the
blood
of
hearts
That
thou
my
brother
my
competitor
In
top
of
all
design
my
mate
in
empire
Friend
and
companion
in
the
front
of
war
The
arm
of
mine
own
body
and
the
heart
Where
mine
his
thoughts
did
kindle
that
our
stars
Unreconciliable
should
divide
Our
equalness
to
this
Hear
me
good
friends
Enter
an
EGYPTIAN
But
I
will
tell
you
at
some
meeter
season
The
business
of
this
man
looks
out
of
him
We
ll
hear
him
what
he
says
Whence
are
you
EGYPTIAN
A
poor
Egyptian
yet
the
Queen
my
mistress
Confin
d

Of
thy

desires
instruction
That
she
preparedly
may
frame
herself
To
th
way
she
s
forc
d
to
CAESAR
Bid
her
have
good
heart
She
soon
shall
know
of
us
by
some
of
ours
How
honourable
and
how
kindly
we
Determine
for
her
for
Caesar
cannot
learn
To
be
ungentle
EGYPTIAN
So
the
gods
preserve
thee
Exit
CAESAR
Come
hither
Proculeius
Go
and
say
We
purpose
her
no
shame
Give
her
what
comforts
The
quality
of
her
passion
shall
require
Lest
in
her
greatness
by
some
mortal
stroke
She
do
defeat
us
for
her
life
in
Rome
Would
be
eternal
in
our
triumph
Go
And
with
your
speediest
bring
us
what
she
says
And
how
you
find
her
PROCULEIUS

Go
with
me
to
my
tent
where
you
shall
see
How
hardly
I

drawn
into
this
war
How

Caesar
Not

Fortune

but
Fortune

knave
A
minister
of
her
will
and
it
is
great
To
do
that
thing
that
ends
all
other
deeds
Which
shackles
accidents
and
bolts
up
change
Which
