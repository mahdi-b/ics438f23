This

MENENIUS
His

is
too

He
would
not
flatter
Neptune
for
his

Or
Jove
for
s
power
to
thunder
His
heart
s
his

What
his

forges
that

does

That

Be

MENENIUS
You
worthy
Tribunes
SICINIUS
He
shall
be
thrown
down

Tarpeian
rock
With
rigorous
hands
he
hath
resisted

And
therefore

shall
scorn

Which

two
The
which
shall
turn
you
to
no
further
harm
Than
so
much
loss
of

SICINIUS
Speak
briefly
then
For
we
are
peremptory
to
dispatch
This
viperous
traitor
to
eject
him
hence
Were
but
one
danger
and
to
keep
him
here
Our
certain
death
therefore
it
is
decreed
He
dies
to

MENENIUS
Now
the
good

forbid
That
our
renowned
Rome

gratitude
Towards
her
deserved
children
is

d
In
Jove

Should

He

MENENIUS
O
he
s
a

that
has

a

Mortal
to

it
off
to
cure
it
easy
What
has
he
done
to
Rome
that
s
worthy
death
Killing
our
enemies
the
blood
he
hath
lost
Which
I
dare
vouch
is
more
than
that
he
hath
By
many
an
ounce
he
dropt
it
for
his
country
And
what
is
left
to
lose
it
by

Were
to

all

A

This

Merely

It

The

Being
once

is
not

For
what
before
it
was
BRUTUS
We
ll
hear
no
more
Pursue
him
to
his
house
and
pluck
him
thence
Lest
his
infection
being
of
catching

Spread

MENENIUS
One

This

The

Tie

Proceed

Lest

Have

In

Does
not

who
was

To
call

woollen
vassals

To
buy
and
sell
with
groats
to
show
bare
heads
In

to
yawn
be
still

When

of

stood

To

Why

You

With

Enter

MENENIUS
Come

something

You

FIRST

There

no

Unless

Cleave

VOLUMNIA
Pray

I
have
a
heart
as

apt
as

But

a

To

vantage
MENENIUS
Well
said
noble
woman
Before

should
thus
stoop
to
th
herd
but
that
The
violent
fit
o
th

craves
it
as
physic
For
the
whole

I
would
put
mine
armour
on
Which
I
can
scarcely
bear
CORIOLANUS
What
must
I
do
MENENIUS
Return
to

tribunes
CORIOLANUS
Well
what
then
what
then
MENENIUS
Repent
what
you

For

I
cannot

Must
I
then

to

VOLUMNIA
You
are
too
absolute
Though
therein
you

when

Honour
and

In

CORIOLANUS
Tush
tush
MENENIUS
A

demand
VOLUMNIA
If
it
be
honour
in
your

to
seem
The
same
you
are
not
which
for
your

ends
You
adopt
your

how
is
it
less
or
worse
That
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
With
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
It
stands
in
like
request
CORIOLANUS
Why
force
you
this
VOLUMNIA
Because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
To
th
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
Nor
by
th
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
But
with
such
words
that
are
but
roted
in
Your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
Of
no
allowance
to
your
bosom
s
truth
Now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
Than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
Which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
The
hazard
of
much
blood
I
would
dissemble
with
my
nature
where
My
fortunes
and
my

at

requir

I
should
do
so
in

I
am

Your

frown

upon

For
the

of
their

and

Of
what
that
want
might
ruin
MENENIUS
Noble

Come

thus

Thy

Action
is

and
the

More
learned
than

Which
often
thus
correcting
thy

Now
humble

That

Hast

thou
dost
confess
Were
fit

In

As

SICINIUS
I

Allow

CORIOLANUS
I
am
content
MENENIUS
Lo
citizens
he
says
he
is
content
The
warlike
service

has
done
consider
think
Upon
the
wounds
his
body
bears
which
show
Like
graves
i
th
holy
churchyard
CORIOLANUS
Scratches
with
briers
Scars
to
move
laughter
only
MENENIUS
Consider
further
That
when
he
speaks
not
like
a
citizen
You
find
him
like
a
soldier
do
not
take
His
rougher
accents
for
malicious
sounds
But
as
I
say
such
as
become
a
soldier
Rather
than
envy
you
COMINIUS

Beating
