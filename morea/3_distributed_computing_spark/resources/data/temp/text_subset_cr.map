The
royal
captain
of
this
ruin
d
band
Walking
from
watch
to
watch
from
tent
to
tent
Let
him
cry
Praise
and
glory
on
his
head
For
forth
he
goes
and
visits
all
his
host
Bids
them
good
morrow
with
a
modest
smile
And
calls
them
brothers
friends
and
countrymen
Upon
his
royal
face
there
is
no
note
How
dread
an
army
hath
enrounded
him
Nor
doth
he
dedicate
one
jot
of
colour
Unto
the
weary
and
all
watched
night
But
freshly
looks
and
over
bears
attaint
With
cheerful
semblance
and
sweet
majesty
That
every
wretch
pining
and
pale
before
Beholding
him
plucks
comfort
from
his
looks
A
largess
universal
like
the
sun
His
liberal
eye
doth
give
to
every
one
Thawing
cold
fear
that
mean
and
gentle
all
Behold
as
may
unworthiness
define
A
little
touch
of
Harry
in
the
night
And
so
our
scene
must
to
the
battle
fly
Where
O
for
pity
we
shall
much
disgrace
With
four
or
five
most
vile
and
ragged
foils
Right
ill
dispos

The

of

Yet

Minding

KING

tis
true

Good
morrow

God
Almighty
There
is

soul
of
goodness

Would

observingly
distil
it
out
For
our
bad
neighbour
makes
us
early
stirrers
Which
is
both
healthful
and
good
husbandry
Besides
they
are
our
outward
consciences
And
preachers
to
us
all
admonishing
That
we
should
dress
us
fairly
for
our
end
Thus
may
we
gather
honey

And
make

Captain

FLUELLEN
So
in

name
of
Jesu

speak

It
is
the
greatest
admiration
in
the
universal
world
when
the
true
and
aunchient
prerogatifes
and
laws
of
the
wars
is
not
kept
if
you
would
take
the
pains
but
to
examine
the

of
Pompey

Great
you
shall
find
I
warrant
you
that
there
is
no
tiddle
taddle
nor
pibble
pabble
in
Pompey
s
camp
I
warrant
you
you
shall
find
the
ceremonies
of
the

and
the
cares
of

and
the
forms
of
it
and
the
sobriety
of

FLUELLEN
If
the

ass

is

think
you
that
we
should
also
look
you
be

In

Welshman
Enter
three
soldiers
JOHN
BATES
ALEXANDER
COURT
and
MICHAEL
WILLIAMS
COURT
Brother
John
Bates
is
not
that
the
morning
which
breaks
yonder
BATES
I
think
it
be
but
we
have
no
great
cause
to
desire
the
approach
of
day
WILLIAMS
We
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day
but
I
think
we
shall
never
see
the
end
of
it
Who
goes
there
KING
HENRY
A
friend
WILLIAMS
Under
what
captain
serve
you
KING
HENRY
Under
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham
WILLIAMS
A
good
old
commander
and
a
most
kind
gentleman
I
pray
you
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate
KING
HENRY
Even
as
men
wreck
d
upon
a
sand
that
look
to
be
wash
d
off
the
next
tide
BATES
He
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
King
KING
HENRY
No
nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should
For
though
I
speak
it
to
you
I
think
the
King
is
but
a
man
as
I
am
the
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
the
element
shows
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
all
his
senses
have
but
human
conditions
his
ceremonies
laid
by
in
his
nakedness
he
appears
but
a
man
and
though
his
affections
are
higher
mounted
than
ours
yet
when
they
stoop
they
stoop
with
the
like
wing
Therefore
when
he
sees
reason
of
fears
as
we
do
his
fears
out
of
doubt
be
of
the
same
relish
as
ours
are
yet
in
reason
no
man
should
possess
him
with
any
appearance
of
fear
lest
he
by
showing
it
should
dishearten
his
army
BATES
He
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will
but
I
believe
as
cold
a
night
as
tis
he
could
wish
himself
in
Thames
up
to
the
neck
and
so
I
would
he
were
and
I
by
him
at
all
adventures
so
we
were
quit
here
KING
HENRY
By
my
troth
I
will
speak
my
conscience
of
the
King
I
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
anywhere
but
where
he
is
BATES
Then
I
would
he
were
here
alone
so
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed
and
a
many
poor
men
s
lives
saved
KING
HENRY
I
dare
say
you
love
him
not
so
ill
to
wish
him
here
alone
howsoever
you
speak
this
to
feel
other
men
s
minds
methinks
I
could
not
die
anywhere
so
contented
as
in
the
King
s
company
his
cause
being
just
and
his
quarrel
honourable
WILLIAMS
That
s
more
than
we
know
BATES
Ay
or
more
than
we
should
seek
after
for
we
know
enough
if
we
know
we
are
the
King
s
subjects
If
his
cause
be
wrong
our
obedience
to
the
King
wipes
the
crime
of
it
out
of
us
WILLIAMS
But
if
the
cause
be
not
good
the
King
himself
hath
a
heavy
reckoning
to
make
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
and
heads
chopp
d
off
in
a
battle
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day
and
cry
all
We
died
at
such
a
place
some
swearing
some
crying
for
a
surgeon
some
upon
their
wives
left
poor
behind
them
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left
I
am
afeard
there
are
few
die
well
that
die
in
a
battle
for
how
can
they
charitably
dispose
of
anything
when
blood
is
their
argument
Now
if
these
men
do
not
die
well
it
will
be
a
black
matter
for
the
King
that
led
them
to
it
who
to
disobey
were
against
all
proportion
of
subjection
KING
HENRY
So
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
sent
about
merchandise
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness
by
your
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father
that
sent
him
or
if
a
servant
under
his
master
s
command
transporting
a
sum
of
money
be
assailed
by
robbers
and
die
in
many
irreconcil
d
iniquities
you
may
call
the
business
of
the
master
the
author
of
the
servant
s
damnation
But
this
is
not
so
the
King
is
not
bound
to
answer
the
particular
endings
of
his
soldiers
the
father
of
his
son
nor
the
master
of
his
servant
for
they
purpose
not
their
death
when
they
purpose
their
services
Besides
there
is
no
king
be
his
cause
never
so
spotless
if
it
come
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
can
try
it
out
with
all
unspotted
soldiers
some
peradventure
have
on
them
the
guilt
of
premeditated
and
contrived
murder
some
of
beguiling
virgins
with
the
broken
seals
of
perjury
some
making
the
wars
their
bulwark
that
have
before
gored
the
gentle
bosom
of
peace
with
pillage
and
robbery
Now
if
these
men
have
defeated
the
law
and
outrun
native
punishment
though
they
can
outstrip
men
they
have
no
wings
to
fly
from
God
war
is
His
beadle
war
is
His
vengeance
so
that
here
men
are
punish
d
for
before
breach
of
the
King
s
laws
in
now
the
King
s
quarrel
Where
they
feared
the
death
they
have
borne
life
away
and
where
they
would
be
safe
they
perish
Then
if
they
die
unprovided
no
more
is
the
King
guilty
of
their
damnation
than
he
was
before
guilty
of
those
impieties
for
the
which
they
are
now
visited
Every
subject
s
duty
is
the
King
s
but
every
subject
s
soul
is
his
own
Therefore
should
every
soldier
in
the
wars
do
as
every
sick
man
in
his
bed
wash
every
mote
out
of
his
conscience
and
dying
so
death
is
to
him
advantage
or
not
dying
the
time
was
blessedly
lost
wherein
such
preparation
was
gained
and
in
him
that
escapes
it
were
not
sin
to
think
that
making
God
so
free
an
offer
He
let
him
outlive
that
day
to
see
His
greatness
and
to
teach
others
how
they
should
prepare
WILLIAMS
Tis
certain
every
man
that
dies
ill
the
ill
upon
his
own
head
the
King
is
not
to
answer
for
it
BATES
I
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me
and
yet
I
determine
to
fight
lustily
for
him
KING
HENRY
I
myself
heard
the
King
say
he
would
not
be
ransom
d
WILLIAMS
Ay
he
said
so
to
make
us
fight
cheerfully
but
when
our
throats
are
cut
he
may
be
ransom
d
and
we
ne
er
the
wiser
KING
HENRY
If
I
live
to
see
it
I
will
never
trust
his
word
after
WILLIAMS
You
pay
him
then
That
s
a
perilous
shot
out
of
an
elder
gun
that
a
poor
and
a
private
displeasure
can
do
against
a
monarch
You
may
as
well
go
about
to
turn
the
sun
to
ice
with
fanning
in
his
face
with
a
peacock
s
feather
You
ll
never
trust
his
word
after
Come
tis
a
foolish
saying
KING
HENRY
Your
reproof
is
something
too
round
I
should
be
angry
with
you
if
the
time
were
convenient
WILLIAMS
Let
it
be
a
quarrel
between
us
if
you
live
KING
HENRY
I
embrace
it
WILLIAMS
How
shall
I
know
thee
again
KING
HENRY
Give
me
any
gage
of
thine
and
I
will
wear
it
in
my
bonnet
then
if
ever
thou
dar
st
acknowledge
it
I
will
make
it
my
quarrel
WILLIAMS
Here
s
my
glove
give
me
another
of
thine
KING
HENRY
There
WILLIAMS
This
will
I
also
wear
in
my
cap
if
ever
thou
come
to
me
and
say
after
to
morrow
This
is
my
glove
by
this
hand
I
will
take
thee
a
box
on
the
ear
KING
HENRY
If
ever
I
live
to
see
it
I
will
challenge
it
WILLIAMS
Thou

Well
I
will
do
it
though
I
take
thee
in
the
King

WILLIAMS
Keep
thy
word
Fare
thee
well
BATES
Be
friends
you
English
fools
be
friends
we
have
French
quarrels
enow
if
you
could
tell
how
to
reckon
KING
HENRY
Indeed
the
French
may
lay
twenty
French
crowns
to
one
they
will
beat
us
for
they
bear
them
on
their
shoulders
but
it
is
no
English
treason
to
cut
French
crowns
and
to
morrow
the
King
himself
will
be
a
clipper
Exeunt
soldiers
Upon
the
King
Let
us
our
lives
our
souls
Our
debts
our
careful
wives
Our
children
and
our
sins
lay
on
the
King
We
must
bear
all
O
hard
condition
Twin
born
with
greatness
subject
to
the
breath
Of
every
fool
whose
sense
no
more
can
feel
But
his
own
wringing
What
infinite
heart
s
ease
Must
kings
neglect
that
private
men
enjoy
And
what
have
kings
that
privates
have
not
too
Save
ceremony
save
general
ceremony
And
what
art
thou
thou
idol
Ceremony
What
kind
of

art
thou
that
suffer

more
Of
mortal
griefs
than

What

What

O
Ceremony
show
me
but
thy
worth
What
is
thy
soul
of
adoration
Art
thou
aught
else
but
place
degree
and
form
Creating
awe
and
fear
in
other
men
Wherein
thou
art
less
happy

Than
they
in
fearing
What
drink
st
thou
oft
instead
of
homage
sweet
But
poison
d
flattery
O
be
sick
great

And
bid
thy
ceremony
give

cure
Thinks
thou
the
fiery
fever
will
go
out
With
titles
blown
from

Will

give

to
flexure
and
low
bending
Canst

Command

No

That
play

I
am
a
king
that
find
thee
and
I
know
Tis
not
the
balm
the
sceptre
and
the
ball
The
sword
the
mace
the
crown
imperial
The
intertissued
robe
of
gold
and
pearl
The
farced
tide
running
fore
the
king
The
throne
he
sits
on
nor
the
tide
of
pomp
That
beats
upon
the
high
shore
of
this
world
No
not
all
these
thrice
gorgeous
ceremony
Not
all
these
laid
in
bed
majestical
Can
sleep
so
soundly
as
the
wretched
slave
Who
with
a
body
fill
d
and
vacant
mind
Gets
him
to
rest
cramm
d
with
distressful
bread
Never
sees
horrid
night
the
child
of
hell
But
like
a
lackey
from
the
rise
to
set
Sweats
in
the
eye
of
Pheebus
and
all
night
Sleeps
in
Elysium
next
day
after
dawn
Doth
rise
and
help
Hyperion
to
his
horse
And
follows
so
the
ever
running
year
With
profitable
labour
to
his
grave
And
but
for
ceremony
such
a
wretch
Winding
up
days
with
toil
and
nights
with
sleep
Had
the
fore
hand
and
vantage
of
a
king
The
slave
a
member
of
the
country
s
peace
Enjoys
it
but
in
gross
brain
little
wots

No

To

The
fewer

the
greater

of

God

I
pray
thee
wish
not
one
man
more
By
Jove
I
am
not
covetous
for
gold
Nor
care
I
who

feed
upon
my
cost
It
yearns
me
not
if
men
my
garments
wear
Such
outward
things
dwell
not
in
my
desires
But
if
it
be
a
sin
to
covet
honour
I
am
the
most
offending
soul
alive
No
faith
my
coz
wish
not
a
man
from
England
God

I
would
not
lose
so
great
an
honour
As
one
man
more
methinks
would
share
from
me
For
the
best
hope
I
have
O
do
not
wish
one
more
Rather
proclaim
it
Westmoreland
through
my
host
That
he
which
hath
no
stomach
to
this
fight
Let
him
depart
his
passport
shall
be
made
And
crowns
for
convoy
put
into
his
purse
We
would
not
die
in
that
man

That
fears
his
fellowship
to
die
with
us
This
day
is
call
d
the

He
that
outlives

Will
stand

And
rouse

Crispian
He
that
shall
live

day
and
see
old
age
Will
yearly
on
the
vigil
feast
his
neighbours
And
say
To
morrow
is
Saint
Crispian
Then
will
he
strip
his
sleeve
and
show
his
scars
And
say
These
wounds
I
had
on
Crispian
s
day
Old
men
forget
yet
all
shall
be
forgot
But
he
ll

What

Then

From

But

We

This

For

thou

Thou
needs
must
be
englutted
Besides
in
mercy
The

desires
thee
thou
wilt
mind
Thy
followers
of
repentance
that
their
souls
May
make
a
peaceful

a
sweet
retire
From
off

Must

While

A

Find
