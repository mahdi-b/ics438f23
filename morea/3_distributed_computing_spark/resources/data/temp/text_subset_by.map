Where

Save
Yourself
my

The

overpeering

Eats

Young

O

Your

The

And

Antiquity

The

That

Let

Do

It

Horatio
when

They
have
letters
for

Ere
we
were
two
days
old
at
sea
a
pirate
of
very
warlike
appointment
gave
us
chase
Finding
ourselves
too
slow
of
sail
we
put
on
a
compelled
valour
and
in
the
grapple
I
boarded
them
On
the
instant
they
got
clear
of
our
ship
so
I
alone
became
their
prisoner
They
have
dealt
with
me
like
thieves
of
mercy
but
they
knew
what
they
did
I
am
to
do
a
good
turn
for
them
Let
the
King
have
the
letters
I
have
sent
and
repair

to
me
with
as
much
speed
as
thou
wouldst
fly

words
to

make
thee

are

fellows

bring

I

Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern

their
course

England
Of

I
have
much

Farewell

Scene
VII
Elsinore
Another
room
in
the
Castle
Enter
King
and
Laertes
King
Now
must
your
conscience
my
acquittance
seal
And
You
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
Sith
you
have
heard
and
with
a
knowing
ear
That
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
Pursued
my
life
Laer
It
well
appears
But
tell
me
Why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
So
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
As
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
You
mainly
were
stirr
d
up
King
O
for
two
special
reasons
Which
may
to
you
perhaps
seein
much
unsinew
d
But
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
The
Queen
his
mother
Lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
My
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
She
s
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
That
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
I
could
not
but
by
her
The
other
motive
Why
to
a
public
count
I
might
not
go
Is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
Who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
Would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
Convert
his
gives
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
Too
slightly
timber
d
for
so
loud
a
wind
Would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
And
not
where
I
had
aim
d
them
Laer
And
so
have
I
a
noble
father
lost
A
sister
driven
into
desp
rate
terms
Whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
Stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
For
her
perfections
But
my
revenge
will
come
King
Break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
You
must
not
think
That
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
That
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
And
think
it
pastime
You
shortly
shall
hear
more
I
lov
d
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
And
that
I
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine
Enter
a
Messenger
with
letters
How
now
What
news
Mess
Letters
my
lord
from
Hamlet
This
to
your
Majesty
this
to
the
Queen
King
From
Hamlet
Who
brought
them

Sailors
my
lord
they
say
I
saw
them
not
They
were
given
me
by
Claudio
he
receiv
d
them
Of
him
that
brought
them
King
Laertes
you
shall
hear
them
Leave
us
Exit
Messenger
Reads
High
and
Mighty
You
shall
know
I
am
set
naked
on
your
kingdom
To
morrow
shall
I
beg
leave
to
see
your
kingly
eyes
when
I
shall
first
asking
your
pardon
thereunto
recount
the
occasion
of
my
sudden
and
more
strange
return
HAMLET
What
should
this
mean
Are
all
the
rest
come
back
Or
is
it
some
abuse
and
no
such
thing
Laer
Know
you
the
hand
King
Tis
Hamlet
s
character
Naked
And
in
a
postscript
here
he
says
alone
Can
you
advise
me
Laer
I
am
lost
in
it
my
lord
But
let
him
come
It
warms
the
very
sickness
in
my
heart
That
I
shall
live
and
tell
him
to
his
teeth
Thus
didest
thou
King
If
it
be
so
Laertes
As
how
should
it
be
so
how
otherwise
Will
you
be
rul
d
by
me
Laer
Ay
my
lord
So
you
will
not
o
errule
me
to
a
peace
King
To
thine
own
peace
If
he
be
now
return
d
As
checking
at
his
voyage
and
that
he
means
No
more
to
undertake
it
I
will
work
him
To
exploit
now
ripe
in
my
device
Under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
And
for
his
death
no
wind
But
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practice
And
call
it
accident
Laer
My
lord
I
will
be
rul
d
The
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
That
I
might
be
the
organ
King
It
falls
right
You
have
been
talk
d
of
since
your
travel
much
And
that
in
Hamlet
s
hearing
for
a
quality
Wherein
they
say
you
shine
Your
sun
of
parts
Did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
As
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
Of
the
unworthiest
siege
Laer
What
part
is
that
my
lord
King
A
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
Yet
needfull
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
The
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
Thin
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
Importing
health
and
graveness
Two
months
since
Here
was
a
gentleman
of
Normandy
I
have
seen
myself
and
serv
d
against
the
French
And
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
Had
witchcraft
in
t
He
grew
unto
his
seat
And
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
As
had
he
been
incorps
d
and
demi
natur
d
With
the
brave
beast
So
far
he
topp
d
my
thought
That
I
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
Come
short
of
what
he
did
Laer
A
Norman
was
t
King
A
Norman
Laer
Upon
my
life
Lamound
King
The
very
same
Laer
I
know
him
well
He
is
the
broach
indeed
And
gem
of
all
the
nation
King
He
made
confession
of
you
And
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
For
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
And
for
your
rapier
most
especially
That
he
cried
out
twould
be
a
sight
indeed
If
one
could
match
you
The
scrimers
of
their
nation
He
swore
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
If
you
oppos
d
them
Sir
this
report
of
his
Did
Hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
That
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
Your
sudden
coming
o
er
to
play
with
you
Now
out
of
this
Laer
What
out
of
this
my
lord
King
Laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
Or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
A
face
without
a
heart
Laer
Why
ask
you
this
King
Not
that
I
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
But
that
I
know
love
is
begun
by
time
And
that
I
see
in
passages
of
proof
Time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
There
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
A
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
And
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
For
goodness
growing
to
a
plurisy
Dies
in
his
own
too
much
That
we
would
do
We
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
And
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
As
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
And
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
That
hurts
by
easing
But
to
the
quick
o
th
ulcer
Hamlet
comes
back
What
would
you
undertake
To
show
yourself
your
father
s
son
in
deed
More
than
in
words
Laer
To
cut
his
throat
i
th
church
King
No
place
indeed
should
murther
sanctuarize
Revenge
should
have
no
bounds
But
good
Laertes
Will
you
do
this
Keep
close
within
your
chamber
Will
return
d
shall
know
you
are
come
home
We
ll
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
And
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
The
Frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
And
wager
on
your
heads
He
being
remiss
Most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
Will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
Or
with
a
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
A
sword
unbated
and
in
a
pass
of
practice
Requite
him
for
your
father
Laer
I
will
do
t
And
for
that
purpose
I
ll
anoint
my
sword
I
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
So
mortal
that
but
dip
a
knife
in
it
Where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
Collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
Under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
This
is
but
scratch
d
withal
I
ll
touch
my
point
With
this
contagion
that
if
I
gall
him
slightly
It
may
be
death
King
Let
s
further
think
of
this
Weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
May
fit
us
to
our
shape
If
this
should
fall
And
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
Twere
better
not
assay
d
Therefore
this
project
Should
have
a
back
or
second
that
might
hold
If
this
did
blast
in
proof
Soft
let
me
see
We
ll
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
I

When
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
As
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
And
that
he
calls
for
drink
I
ll
have
prepar
d
him
A
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon

If

How

Queen
One

There
is
a
willow

brook
That

hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy

There
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
Of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies

long
purples
That
liberal

Fell

Her

And

bore

Which
time
she
chaunted
snatches

As

defence
Other
Why

Clown
It
must

For
here
lies
the
point

argues
an
act
and
an
act
hath
three
branches
it
is

mark
you
that
But
if

water

to
him
and
drown
him
he
drowns
not
himself
Argal
he
that
is
not
guilty
of
his
own
death
shortens
not
his
own
life
Other
But

law

a
gentlewoman
she
should
have
been
buried
out
o
Christian

Clown
Why

say
st
And
the
more
pity
that
great
folk
should
have
count
nance
in
this
world
to
drown
or
hang
themselves
more
than
their
even
Christen
Come

spade
There
is
no
ancient
gentlemen
but
gard
ners
ditchers
and
grave
makers
They
hold
up
Adam

profession
Other
Was
he
a
gentleman
Clown
A

the
first

ever
bore
arms
Other
Why

What

heathen
How
dost
thou
understand
the
Scripture
The
Scripture
says
Adam
digg
d
Could
he
dig
without
arms
I
ll
put
another
question
to
thee
If
thou
answerest
me
not
to
the
purpose
confess
thyself
Other
Go
to
Clown
What
is
he
that
builds
stronger
than
either
the
mason
the
shipwright
or
the
carpenter
Other
The
gallows
maker
for
that
frame
outlives
a
thousand
tenants
Clown
I
like
thy
wit
well
in
good
faith
The
gallows
does
well
But
how
does
it
well
It
does
well
to
those
that
do
ill
Now
thou
dost
ill
to
say
the
gallows
is
built
stronger
than
the
church
Argal
the
gallows
may
do
well
to
thee
To

question
next

In

Methought

very
sweet
To

time
for
a
my
behove
O
methought
there

Ham
Has
this
fellow
no
feeling
of
his
business

he
sings
at
grave
making
Hor
Custom
hath
made
it
in
him
a
Property
of
easiness
Ham
Tis

en
so
The
hand
of
little
employment
hath
the
daintier
sense
Clown
sings
But
age
with
his
stealing
steps
Hath
clawed
me
in
his
clutch
And
hath
shipped
me
intil
the
land
As
if
I
had
never
been
such
Throws
up
a
skull
Ham
That
skull
had
a
tongue
in
it
and
could
sing
once
How
the
knave
jowls
it
to
the
ground
as
if
twere
Cain

circumvent
