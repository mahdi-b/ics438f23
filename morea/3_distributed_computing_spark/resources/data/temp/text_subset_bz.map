Of

No

thus
Alexander

A

Enter

So
much
for
this
sir
now
shall
you
see
the
other
You
do
remember
all
the
circumstance
Hor
Remember
it
my
lord
Ham
Sir
in
my
heart
there
was
a
kind
of
fighting
That
would
not
let
me
sleep
Methought
I
lay
Worse
than
the
mutinies
in
the
bilboes
Rashly
And
prais
d
be
rashness
for
it
let
us
know
Our
indiscretion
sometime
serves
us
well
When
our
deep
plots
do
pall
and
that
should
learn
us
There
s
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
Rough
hew
them
how
we
will
Hor
That
is
most
certain
Ham
Up
from
my
cabin
My
sea
gown

d
about
me
in
the
dark
Grop
d
I
to
find
out
them
had
my
desire
Finger
d
their
packet
and
in
fine
withdrew
To
mine
own
room
again
making
so
bold
My
fears
forgetting
manners
to
unseal
Their
grand
commission
where
I
found
Horatio
O
royal
knavery
an
exact
command
Larded
with
many
several
sorts
of
reasons
Importing
Denmark
s
health
and
England
s
too
With
hoo
such
bugs
and
goblins
in
my
life
That
on
the
supervise
no
leisure
bated
No
not
to
stay
the
finding
of
the
axe
My
head
should
be
struck
off
Hor
Is
t
possible
Ham
Here
s
the
commission
read
it
at
more
leisure
But
wilt
thou
bear
me
how
I
did
proceed
Hor
I
beseech
you
Ham
Being
thus
benetted
round
with
villanies
Or
I
could
make
a
prologue
to
my
brains
They
had
begun
the
play
I
sat
me
down
Devis
d
a
new
commission
wrote
it
fair
I
once
did
hold
it
as
our
statists
do
A
baseness
to
write
fair
and
labour
d
much
How
to
forget
that
learning
but
sir
now
It
did
me
yeoman
s
service
Wilt
thou
know
Th
effect
of
what
I
wrote
Hor
Ay
good
my
lord
Ham
An
earnest
conjuration
from
the
King
As
England
was
his
faithful
tributary
As
love
between
them
like
the
palm
might
flourish
As
peace
should
still
her
wheaten
garland
wear
And
stand
a
comma
tween
their
amities
And
many
such
like
as
s
of
great
charge
That
on
the
view
and
knowing
of
these
contents
Without
debatement
further
more
or
less
He
should
the
bearers
put
to
sudden
death
Not
shriving
time
allow
d
Hor
How
was
this
seal
d
Ham
Why
even
in
that
was
heaven
ordinant
I
had
my
father
s
signet
in
my
purse
which
was
the
model
of
that
Danish
seal
Folded
the
writ
up
in
the
form
of
th
other
Subscrib
d
it
gave
t
th
impression
plac
d
it
safely
The
changeling
never
known
Now
the
next
day
Was
our
sea
fight
and
what
to
this
was
sequent
Thou
know
st
already
Hor
So
Guildenstern
and
Rosencrantz
go
to
t
Ham
Why
man
they
did
make
love
to
this
employment
They
are
not
near
my
conscience
their
defeat
Does
by
their
own
insinuation
grow
Tis
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
Between
the
pass
and
fell
incensed
points
Of
mighty
opposites
Hor
Why
what
a
king
is
this
Ham
Does
it
not
thinks
t
thee
stand
me
now
upon
He
that
hath
kill
d
my
king
and

d
my
mother
Popp
d
in
between
th
election
and
my
hopes
Thrown
out
his
angle
for
my
Proper
life
And
with
such
coz
nage
is
t
not
perfect
conscience
To
quit
him
with
this
arm
And
is
t
not
to
be
damn
d
To
let
this
canker
of
our
nature
come
In
further
evil
Hor
It
must
be
shortly
known
to
him
from
England
What
is
the
issue
of
the
business
there
Ham
It
will
be
short
the
interim
is
mine
And
a
man
s
life
is
no
more
than
to
say
one
But
I
am
very
sorry
good
Horatio
That
to
Laertes
I
forgot
myself
For
by
the
image
of
my
cause
I
see
The
portraiture
of
his
I
ll
court
his
favours
But
sure
the
bravery
of
his
grief
did
put
me
Into
a
tow
ring
passion
Hor
Peace
Who
comes
here
Enter

Osric

Osr
Your

is
right

Aside

lordship
were
at
leisure
I
should
impart
a
thing
to
you
from
his
Majesty
Ham
I
will
receive
it
sir
with
all
diligence
of
spirit
Put
your
bonnet
to
his
right
use
Tis
for
the
head
Osr
I
thank
your
lordship
it
is
very
hot
Ham
No
believe
me
tis
very
cold
the
wind
is
northerly
Osr
It
is
indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
Ham
But
yet
methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
Osr
Exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultry
as
twere
I
cannot
tell
how
But
my
lord
his
Majesty
bade
me
signify
to
you
that
he
has
laid
a
great
wager
on
your
head
Sir
this
is
the
matter
Ham
I
beseech
you
remember
Hamlet
moves
him
to
put
on
his
hat
Osr
Nay
good
my
lord
for
mine
ease
in
good
faith
Sir
here
is
newly
come
to
court
Laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
Indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
a
gentleman
would
see
Ham
Sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
I
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dozy
th
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
But
in
the
verity
of
extolment
I
take
him
to
be
a
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
Osr
Your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
Ham
The
concernancy
sir
Why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
Osr
Sir
Hor
aside
to
Hamlet
Is
t
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
You
will
do
t
sir
really
Ham
What
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
Osr
Of
Laertes
Hor
aside
His
purse
is
empty
already
All
s
golden
words
are
spent
Ham
Of
him
sir
Osr
I
know
you
are
not
ignorant
Ham
I
would
you
did
sir
yet
in
faith
if
you
did
it
would
not
much
approve
me
Well
sir
Osr
You
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
Laertes
is
Ham
I
dare
not
confess
that
lest
I
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
a
man
well
were
to
know
himself
Osr
I
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on
him
by
them
in
his
meed
he
s
unfellowed
Ham
What
s
his
weapon
Osr
Rapier
and
dagger
Ham
That
s
two
of
his
weapons
but
well
Osr
The
King
sir
hath
wager
d
with
him
six
Barbary
horses
against
the
which
he
has
impon
d
as
I
take
it
six
French
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers
and
so
Three
of
the
carriages
in
faith
are
very
dear
to
fancy
very
responsive
to
the
hilts
most
delicate
carriages
and
of
very
liberal
conceit
Ham
What
call
you
the
carriages
Hor
aside
to
Hamlet
I
knew
you
must
be
edified
by
the
margent
ere
you
had
done
Osr
The
carriages
sir
are
the
hangers
Ham
The
phrase
would
be
more
germane
to
the
matter
if
we
could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
I
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
But
on
Six
Barbary
horses
against
six
French
swords
their
assigns
and
three
liberal
conceited
carriages
that
s
the
French
bet
against
the
Danish
Why
is
this
all
impon
d
as
you
call
it
Osr
The
King
sir
hath
laid
that
in
a
dozen
passes
between
yourself
and
him
he
shall
not
exceed
you
three
hits
he
hath
laid
on
twelve
for
nine
and
it
would
come
to
immediate
trial
if
your
lordship
would
vouchsafe
the
answer
Ham
How
if
I
answer
no
Osr
I
mean
my
lord
the
opposition
of
your
person
in
trial
Ham
Sir
I
will
walk
here
in
the
hall
If
it
please
his
Majesty
it
is
the
breathing
time
of
day
with
me
Let
the
foils
be
brought
the
gentleman
willing
and
the
King
hold
his
purpose
I
will
win
for
him
if
I
can
if
not
I
will
gain
nothing
but
my
shame
and
the
odd
hits
Osr
Shall
I
redeliver
you
e
en
so
Ham
To
this
effect
sir
after
what
flourish
your
nature
will
Osr
I
commend
my
duty
to
your
lordship
Ham
Yours
yours
Exit
Osric
He
does
well
to
commend
it
himself
there
are
no
tongues
else
for
s
turn
Hor
This
lapwing
runs
away
with
the
shell
on
his
head
Ham
He
did
comply
with
his
dug
before
he
suck
d
it
Thus
has
he
and
many
more
of
the
same
bevy
that
I
know
the
drossy
age
dotes
on
only
got
the
tune
of
the
time
and
outward
habit
of
encounter
a
kind
of
yesty
collection
which
carries
them
through
and
through
the
most
fann
d
and
winnowed
opinions
and
do
but
blow
them
to
their
trial
the
bubbles
are
out
Enter
a
Lord
Lord
My
lord
his
Majesty
commended
him
to
you
by
young
Osric
who
brings
back
to
him
that
you
attend
him
in
the
hall
He
sends
to
know
if
your
pleasure
hold
to
play
with
Laertes
or
that
you
will
take
longer
time
Ham
I
am
constant
to
my
purposes
they
follow
the
King
s
pleasure
If
his
fitness
speaks
mine
is
ready
now
or
whensoever
provided
I
be
so
able
as
now
Lord
The
King
and
Queen
and
all
are
coming
down
Ham
In
happy
time
Lord
The
Queen
desires
you
to
use
some
gentle
entertainment
to
Laertes
before
you
fall
to
play
Ham
She
well
instructs
me
Exit
Lord
Hor
You
will
lose
this
wager
my
lord
Ham
I
do
not
think
so
Since
he
went
into
France
I
have
been
in
continual
practice
I
shall
win
at
the
odds
But
thou
wouldst
not
think
how
ill
all
s
here
about
my
heart
But
it
is
no
matter
Hor
Nay
good
my
lord
Ham
It
is
but
foolery
but
it
is
such
a
kind
of
gaingiving
as
would
perhaps
trouble
a
woman
Hor
If
your
mind
dislike
anything
obey
it
I
will
forestall
their
repair
hither
and
say
you
are
not
fit
Ham
Not
a
whit
we
defy
augury
there
s
a
special
providence
in
the
fall
of
a
sparrow
If
it
be
now
tis
not
to
come
if
it
be
not
to
come
it
will
be
now
if
it
be
not
now
yet
it
will
come
the
readiness
is
all
Since
no
man
knows
aught
of
what
he
leaves
what
is
t
to
leave
betimes
Let
be
Enter
King

Laertes
Osric
and
Lords
with

Attendants

A
table
and
flagons
of
wine

King
Come
Hamlet
come
and
take
this
hand
from
me
The
King
puts
Laertes
hand
into
Hamlet
s
Ham
Give
me
your
pardon
sir
I
have
done
you
wrong
But
pardon
t
as
you
are
a
gentleman
This
presence
knows
And
you
must
needs
have
heard
how
I
am
punish
d
With
sore
distraction
What
I
have
done
That
might
your
nature
honour
and
exception
Roughly
awake
I
here
proclaim
was
madness
Was
t
Hamlet
wrong
d
Laertes
Never
Hamlet
If
Hamlet
from
himself
be
taken
away
And
when
he
s
not
himself
does
wrong
Laertes
Then
Hamlet
does
it
not
Hamlet
denies
it
Who
does
it
then
His
madness
If
t
be
so
Hamlet
is
of
the
faction
that
is
wrong
d
His
madness
is
poor
Hamlet
s
enemy
Sir
in
this
audience
Let
my
disclaiming
from
a
purpos
d
evil
Free
me
so
far
in
your
most
generous
thoughts
That
I
have
shot
my
arrow
o
er
the
house
And
hurt
my
brother
Laer
I
am
satisfied
in
nature
Whose
motive
in
this
case
should
stir
me
most
To
my
revenge
But
in
my
terms
of
honour
I
stand
aloof
and
will
no
reconcilement
Till
by
some
elder
masters
of
known
honour
I
have
a
voice
and
precedent
of
peace
To
keep
my
name
ungor
d
But
till
that
time
I
do
receive
your
offer
d
love
like
love
And
will
not
wrong
it
Ham
I
embrace
it
freely
And
will
this
brother
s
wager
frankly
play
Give
us
the
foils
Come
on
Laer
Come
one
for
me
Ham
I
ll
be
your
foil
Laertes
In
mine
ignorance
Your
skill
shall
like
a
star
i
th
darkest
night
Stick
fiery
off
indeed
Laer
You
mock
me
sir
Ham
No
by
this
bad
King
Give
them
the
foils
young
Osric
Cousin
Hamlet
You
know
the
wager
Ham
Very
well
my
lord
Your
Grace
has
laid
the
odds
o
th
weaker
side
King
I
do
not
fear
it
I
have
seen
you
both
But
since
he
is
better
d
we
have
therefore
odds
Laer
This
is
too
heavy
let
me
see
another
Ham
This
likes
me
well
These
foils
have
all
a
length
Prepare
to
play
Osr
Ay
my
good
lord
King
Set
me
the
stoups
of
wine
upon
that
table
If
Hamlet
give
the
first
or
second
hit
Or
quit
in
answer
of
the
third
exchange
Let
all
the
battlements
their
ordnance
fire
The
King
shall
drink
to
Hamlet
s
better
breath
And
in
the
cup
an
union
shall
he
throw
Richer
than
that
which
four
successive
kings
In
Denmark
s
crown
have
worn
Give
me
the
cups
