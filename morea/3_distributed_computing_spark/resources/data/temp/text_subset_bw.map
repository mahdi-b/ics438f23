very

Queen
embracing

She
kneels

makes
show

He
takes

declines
his

He
lays

Anon

pours
poison

The

Poisoner

The
dead

As

King

Queen
King
Full
thirty
times
hath
Phoebus
cart
gone
round
Neptune
s
salt
wash
and
Tellus
orbed
ground
And
thirty
dozed
moons
with
borrowed
sheen
About
the
world
have
times
twelve
thirties
been
Since
love
our
hearts
and
Hymen
did
our
hands
Unite
comutual
in
most
sacred
bands
Queen
So
many
journeys
may
the
sun
and
moon
Make
us
again
count
o
er
ere
love
be
done
But
woe
is
me
you
are
so
sick
of
late
So
far
from
cheer
and
from
your
former
state
That
I
distrust
you
Yet
though
I
distrust
Discomfort
you
my
lord
it
nothing
must
For
women
s
fear
and
love
holds
quantity
In
neither
aught
or
in
extremity
Now
what
my
love
is
proof
hath
made
you
know
And
as
my
love
is
siz
d
my
fear
is
so
Where
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
Where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
there
King
Faith
I
must
leave
thee
love
and
shortly
too
My
operant
powers
their
functions
leave
to
do
And
thou
shalt
live
in
this
fair
world
behind
Honour
d
belov
d
and
haply
one
as
kind
For
husband
shalt
thou
Queen
O
confound
the
rest
Such
love
must
needs
be
treason
in
my
breast
When
second
husband
let
me
be
accurst
None
wed
the
second
but
who
killed
the
first
Ham
aside
Wormwood
wormwood
Queen
The
instances
that
second
marriage
move
Are
base
respects
of
thrift
but
none
of
love
A
second
time
I
kill
my
husband
dead
When
second
husband
kisses
me
in
bed
King
I
do
believe
you
think
what
now
you
speak
But
what
we
do
determine
oft
we
break
Purpose
is
but
the
slave
to
memory
Of
violent
birth
but
poor
validity
Which
now
like
fruit
unripe
sticks
on
the
tree
But
fill
unshaken
when
they
mellow
be
Most
necessary
tis
that
we
forget
To
pay
ourselves
what
to
ourselves
is
debt
What
to
ourselves
in
passion
we
propose
The
passion
ending
doth
the
purpose
lose
The
violence
of
either
grief
or
joy
Their
own
enactures
with
themselves
destroy
Where
joy
most
revels
grief
doth
most
lament
Grief
joys
joy
grieves
on
slender
accident
This
world
is
not
for
aye
nor
tis
not
strange
That
even
our
loves
should
with
our
fortunes
change
For
tis
a
question
left
us
yet
to
prove
Whether
love
lead
fortune
or
else
fortune
love
The
great
man
down
you
mark
his
favourite
flies
The
poor
advanc
d
makes
friends
of
enemies
And
hitherto
doth
love
on
fortune
tend
For
who
not
needs
shall
never
lack
a
friend
And
who
in
want
a
hollow
friend
doth
try
Directly
seasons
him
his
enemy
But
orderly
to
end
where
I
begun
Our
wills
and
fates
do
so
contrary
run
That
our
devices
still
are
overthrown
Our
thoughts
are
ours
their
ends
none
of
our
own
So
think
thou
wilt
no
second
husband
wed
But
die
thy
thoughts
when
thy
first
lord
is
dead
Queen
Nor
earth
to
me
give
food
nor
heaven
light
Sport
and
repose
lock
from
me
day
and
night
To
desperation
turn
my
trust
and
hope
An
anchor
s
cheer
in
prison
be
my
scope
Each
opposite
that
blanks
the
face
of
joy
Meet
what
I
would
have
well
and
it
destroy
Both
here
and
hence
pursue
me
lasting
strife
If
once
a
widow
ever
I
be

Ham
If
she
should
break
it
now
King
Tis
deeply
sworn
Sweet
leave
me

show

more
richer
to
signify
this

doctor

perhaps
plunge

more
choler

unworthy

You

pluck

A
brother
s
murther
Pray
can
I
not
Though
inclination
be
as
sharp
as
will
My
stronger
guilt
defeats
my
strong
intent
And
like
a
man
to
double
business
bound
I
stand
in
pause
where
I
shall
first
begin
And
both
neglect
What
if
this
cursed
hand
Were
thicker
than
itself
with
brother
s
blood
Is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
To
wash
it
white
as
snow
Whereto
serves
mercy
But
to
confront
the
visage
of
offence
And
what
s
in
prayer
but
this
twofold
force
To
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
Or
pardon
d
being
down
Then
I
ll
look
up
My
fault
is
past
But
O
what
form
of
prayer
Can
serve
my
turn
Forgive
me
my
foul
murther
That
cannot
be
since
I
am
still
possess
d
Of
those
effects
for
which
I
did
the
murther
My
crown
mine
own
ambition
and
my
queen
May
one
be
pardon
d
and
retain
th
offence
In
the
corrupted
currents
of
this
world
Offence
s
gilded
hand
may
shove
by
justice
And
oft
tis
seen
the
wicked
prize
itself
Buys
out
the
law
but
tis
not
so
above
There
is
no
shuffling
there
the
action
lies
In
his
true
nature
and
we
ourselves
compell
d
Even
to
the
teeth
and
forehead
of
our
faults
To
give
in
evidence
What
then
What
rests
Try
what
repentance
can
What
can
it
not
Yet
what
can
it
when
one
cannot
repent
O
wretched
state
O
bosom
black
as
death
O
limed
soul
that
struggling
to
be

Art

Now

A
villain
kills
my
father
and
for
that
I
his
sole
son
do
this
same
villain
send
To
heaven
Why
this
is
hire
and
salary
not
revenge
He
took
my
father
grossly
full
of
bread
With
all
his
crimes
broad
blown
as
flush
as
May
And
how
his
audit
stands

But
in

of

Tis
heavy
with
him
and
am
I
then
reveng

To
take
him
in

purging
of
his
soul
When

is
fit

seasoned
for
his
passage
No
Up

and
know

hent
When

asleep

in

rage
Or
in
th
incestuous
pleasure
of
his
bed
At
gaming
swearing
or
about
some
act
That
has
no
relish
of

Then
trip
him
that
his
heels
may
kick

And

As

Enter
Queen
and
Polonius
Pol
He
will
come
straight
Look

lay
home
to
him
Tell
him
his
pranks
have
been
too
broad
to
bear
with
And

your
Grace
hath
screen

between
Much

and

I

Pray

Withdraw

Enter
Hamlet
Ham
Now

the
matter
Queen
Hamlet

hast
thy
father
much
offended
Ham
Mother

have
my
father
much
offended
Queen
Come
come
you
answer
with
an
idle
tongue
Ham
Go

you
question
with
a
wicked
tongue
Queen
Why
how
now
Hamlet
Ham
What
s
the
matter
now
Queen
Have
you
forgot
me
Ham
No
by
the
rood
not
so
You
are
the
Queen
your
husband
s
brother
s
wife
And
would
it
were
not
so
you
are
my
mother
Queen
Nay
then
I
ll
set
those
to
you
that
can
speak
Ham
Come
come
and
sit
you
down
You
shall
not
budge
I
You
go
not
till
I
set
you
up
a
glass
Where
you
may
see
the
inmost
part
of
you
Queen
What
wilt
thou
do
Thou
wilt
not
murther
me
Help
help

What

Ham
draws
How
now
a
rat
Dead
for
a
ducat
dead
Makes
a
pass
through
the
arras
and
kills
Polonius
Pol
behind
O
I
am
slain
Queen
O
me
what
hast
thou
done
Ham
Nay
I
know
not
Is
it
the
King
Queen
O
what
a
rash
and
bloody
deed
is
this
Ham
A
bloody
deed
almost
as
bad
good
mother
As
kill
a
king
and
marry
with
his
brother
Queen
As
kill
a
king
Ham
Ay
lady
it
was
my
word
Lifts
up
the
arras
and
sees
Polonius
Thou
wretched
rash
intruding
fool
farewell
I
took
thee
for
thy
better
Take
thy
fortune
Thou
find
st
to
be
too
busy
is
some
danger
Leave
wringing
of
your
hinds
Peace
sit
you
down
And
let
me
wring
your
heart
for
so
I
shall
If
it
be
made
of
penetrable
stuff
If
damned
custom
have
not
braz
d
it
so
That
it
is
proof
and
bulwark
against
sense
Queen
What
have
I
done
that
thou
dar
st
wag
thy
tongue
In
noise
so
rude
against
me
Ham
Such
an
act
That
blurs
the
grace
and
blush
of
modesty
Calls
virtue
hypocrite
takes
off
the
rose
From
the
fair
forehead
of
an
innocent
love
And
sets
a
blister
there
makes
marriage
vows
As
false
as
dicers
oaths
O
such
a
deed
As
from
the
body
of
contraction
plucks
The
very
soul
and
sweet
religion
makes
A
rhapsody
of
words
Heaven
s
face
doth
glow
Yea
this
solidity
and
compound
mass
With
tristful
visage
as
against
the
doom
Is
thought
sick
at
the
act
Queen
Ay
me
what
act
That
roars
so
loud
and
thunders
in
the
index
Ham
Look
here
upon
th
s
picture
and
on
this
The
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers
See
what
a
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
Hyperion
s
curls
the
front
of
Jove
himself
An
eye
like
Mars
to
threaten
and
command
A
station
like
the
herald
Mercury
New
lighted
on
a
heaven
kissing
hill
A
combination
and
a
form
indeed
Where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
To
give
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
This
was
your
husband
Look
you
now
what
follows
Here
is
your
husband
like
a
mildew
d
ear
Blasting
his
wholesome
brother
Have
you
eyes
Could
you
on
this
fair
mountain
leave
to
feed
And
batten
on
this
moor
Ha
have
you
eyes
You
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
The
heyday
in
the
blood
is
tame
it
s
humble
And
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
Would
step
from
this
to
this
Sense
sure
you
have
Else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
Is
apoplex
d
for
madness
would
not
err
Nor
sense
to
ecstacy
was
ne
er
so
thrall
d
But
it
reserv
d
some
quantity
of
choice
To
serve
in
such
a
difference
What
devil
was
t
That
thus
hath
cozen
d
you
at
hoodman
blind
Eyes
without
feeling
feeling
without
sight
Ears
without
hands
or
eyes
smelling
sans
all
Or
but
a
sickly
part
of
one
true
sense
Could
not
so
mope
O
shame
where
is
thy
blush
Rebellious
hell
If
thou
canst
mutine
in
a
matron
s
bones
To
flaming
youth
let
virtue
be
as
wax
And
melt
in
her
own
fire
Proclaim
no
shame
When
the
compulsive
ardour
gives
the
charge
Since
frost
itself
as
actively
doth
burn
And
reason
panders
will
Queen
O
Hamlet
speak
no
more
Thou
turn
st
mine
eyes
into
my
very
soul
And
there
I
see
such
black
and
grained
spots
As
will
not
leave
their
tinct
Ham
Nay
but
to
live
In
the
rank
sweat
of
an
enseamed
bed
