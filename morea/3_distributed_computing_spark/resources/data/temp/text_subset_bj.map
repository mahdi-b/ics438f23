The

Than

our

There

no

I

MENENIUS

MENENIUS

me

The

his

sours
ripe
grapes

he
moves

the

shrinks

able

pierce
a

with
his

talks
like
a

his
hum

a

He
sits
in
his

as
a

What
he
bids
be

finish

eternity

a

Yes
mercy
if

him
truly
MENENIUS

him

There

Even
so
As
with
a
man
by
his
own
alms
empoison
d
And
with

Of

THIRD
CONSPIRATOR
The
people
will
remain
uncertain
whilst
Twixt
you
there
s
difference
but
the
fall
of
either
Makes
the
survivor
heir
of
all
AUFIDIUS
I
know
it
And
my
pretext
to
strike
at
him
admits
A
good
construction
I
rais
d
him
and
I
pawn
d
Mine
honour
for
his
truth
who
being
so
heighten
d
He
watered
his
new
plants
with
dews
of
flattery
Seducing
so
my
friends
and
to
this
end
He
bow
d
his
nature
never
known
before
But
to
be
rough
unswayable
and
free
THIRD
CONSPIRATOR
Sir
his
stoutness
When
he
did
stand
for
consul
which
he
lost
By
lack
of
stooping
AUFIDIUS
That
I
would
have
spoken
of
Being
banish
d
for
t
he
came
unto
my
hearth
Presented
to
my
knife
his
throat
I
took
him
Made
him
joint
servant
with
me
gave
him
way
In
all
his
own
desires
nay
let
him
choose
Out
of
my
files
his
projects
to
accomplish
My
best
and
freshest
men
serv
d
his
designments
In
mine
own
person
holp
to
reap
the
fame
Which
he
did
end
all
his
and
took
some
pride
To
do
myself
this
wrong
Till
at
the
last
I
seem
d
his
follower
not
partner
and
He
wag
d
me
with
his
countenance
as
if
I
had
been
mercenary
FIRST
CONSPIRATOR
So
he
did
my
lord
The
army
marvell
d
at
it
and
in
the
last
When
he
had
carried
Rome
and
that
we
look
d
For
no
less
spoil
than
glory
AUFIDIUS
There
was
it
For
which
my
sinews
shall
be
stretch
d
upon
him
At
a
few
drops
of
women
s
rheum
which
are
As
cheap
as
lies
he
sold
the
blood
and
labour
Of
our
great
action
therefore
shall
he
die
And
I
ll
renew
me
in
his
fall
But
hark
Drums
and
trumpets
sound
with
great
shouts
of
the
people
FIRST
CONSPIRATOR
Your
native
town

enter
d
like
a
post
And
had
no
welcomes
home
but
he
returns
Splitting
the
air
with
noise
SECOND
CONSPIRATOR
And
patient
fools
Whose
children
he
hath
slain
their
base
throats
tear
With
giving
him
glory
THIRD
CONSPIRATOR
Therefore
at
your
vantage
Ere
he
express
himself
or
move
the
people
With
what
he
would
say
let
him
feel
your
sword
Which
we
will
second
When

lies
along
After
your

His
reasons

LORDS
We

FIRST
LORD
And
grieve
to
hear
t
What
faults
he
made
before
the
last
I
think
Might
have
found
easy
fines
but
there
to
end
Where
he
was
to
begin
and
give
away
The
benefit
of
our
levies
answering
us
With
our
own
charge
making
a
treaty
where
There
was
a
yielding
this
admits
no
excuse
AUFIDIUS
He
approaches
you
shall
hear

Enter

With

Our

The
charges
of
the
action
We
have
made

With
no
less
honour
to
the
Antiates
