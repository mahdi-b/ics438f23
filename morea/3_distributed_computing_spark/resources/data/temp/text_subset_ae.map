And
the
just
pleasure
lost
which
is
so
deemed
Not
by
our
feeling
but
by
others
seeing
For
why
should
others
false
adulterate
eyes
Give
salutation
to
my
sportive
blood
Or
on
my
frailties
why
are
frailer
spies
Which
in
their
wills
count
bad
what
I
think
good
No
I
am
that
I
am
and
they
that
level
At
my
abuses
reckon
up
their
own
I
may
be
straight
though
they
themselves
be
bevel
By
their
rank
thoughts
my
deeds
must
not
be
shown
Unless
this
general
evil
they
maintain
All
men
are
bad
and
in
their
badness
reign
122
Thy
gift
thy
tables
are
within
my
brain
Full
charactered
with
lasting
memory
Which
shall
above
that
idle
rank
remain
Beyond
all
date
even
to
eternity
Or
at
the
least
so
long
as
brain
and
heart
Have
faculty
by
nature
to
subsist
Till
each
to
razed
oblivion
yield
his
part
Of
thee
thy
record
never
can
be
missed
That
poor
retention
could
not
so
much
hold
Nor
need
I
tallies
thy
dear
love
to
score
Therefore
to
give
them
from
me
was
I
bold
To
trust
those
tables
that
receive
thee
more
To
keep
an
adjunct
to
remember
thee
Were
to
import
forgetfulness
in
me
123
No
Time
thou
shalt
not
boast
that
I
do
change
Thy
pyramids
built
up
with
newer
might
To
me
are
nothing
novel
nothing
strange
They
are
but
dressings
Of
a
former
sight
Our
dates
are
brief
and
therefore
we
admire
What
thou
dost
foist
upon
us
that
is
old
And
rather
make
them
born
to
our
desire
Than
think
that
we
before
have
heard
them
told
Thy
registers
and
thee
I
both
defy
Not
wond
ring
at
the
present
nor
the
past
For
thy
records
and
what
we
see
doth
lie
Made
more
or
less
by
thy
continual
haste
This
I
do
vow
and
this
shall
ever
be
I
will
be
true
despite
thy
scythe
and
thee
124
If
my
dear
love
were
but
the
child
of
state
It
might
for
Fortune
s
bastard
be
unfathered
As
subject
to
time
s
love
or
to
time
s
hate
Weeds
among
weeds
or
flowers
with
flowers
gathered
No
it
was
builded
far
from
accident
It
suffers
not
in
smiling
pomp
nor
falls
Under
the
blow
of
thralled
discontent
Whereto
th
inviting
time
our
fashion
calls
It
fears
not
policy
that
heretic
Which
works
on
leases
of
short
numbered
hours
But
all
alone
stands
hugely
politic
That
it
nor
grows
with
heat
nor
drowns
with
showers
To
this
I
witness
call
the
fools
of
time
Which
die
for
goodness
who
have
lived
for
crime
125
Were
t
aught
to
me
I
bore
the
canopy
With
my
extern
the
outward
honouring
Or
laid
great
bases
for
eternity
Which
proves
more
short
than
waste
or
ruining
Have
I
not
seen
dwellers
on
form
and
favour
Lose
all
and
more
by
paying
too
much
rent
For
compound
sweet
forgoing
simple
savour
Pitiful
thrivers
in
their
gazing
spent
No
let
me
be
obsequious
in
thy
heart
And
take
thou
my
oblation
poor
but
free
Which
is
not
mixed
with
seconds
knows
no
art
But
mutual
render
only
me
for
thee
Hence
thou
suborned
informer
a
true
soul
When
most
impeached
stands
least
in
thy
control
126
O
thou
my
lovely
boy
who
in
thy
power
Dost
hold
Time
s
fickle
glass
his
fickle
hour
Who
hast
by
waning
grown
and
therein
show
st
Thy
lovers
withering
as
thy
sweet
self
grow
st
If
Nature
sovereign
mistress
over
wrack
As
thou
goest
onwards
still
will
pluck
thee
back
She
keeps
thee
to
this
purpose
that
her
skill
May
time
disgrace
and
wretched
minutes
kill
Yet
fear
her
O
thou
minion
of
her
pleasure
She
may
detain
but
not
still
keep
her
treasure
Her
audit
though
delayed
answered
must
be
And
her
quietus
is
to
render
thee
127
In
the
old
age
black
was
not
counted
fair
Or
if
it
were
it
bore
not
beauty
s
name
But
now
is
black
beauty
s
successive
heir
And
beauty
slandered
with
a
bastard
shame
For
since
each
hand
hath
put
on
nature
s
power
Fairing
the
foul
with
art
s
false
borrowed
face
Sweet
beauty
hath
no
name
no
holy
bower
But
is
profaned
if
not
lives
in
disgrace
Therefore
my
mistress
eyes
are
raven
black
Her
eyes
so
suited
and
they
mourners
seem
At
such
who
not
born
fair
no
beauty
lack
Slandering
creation
with
a
false
esteem
Yet
so
they
mourn
becoming
of
their
woe
That
every
tongue
says
beauty
should
look
so
128
How
oft
when
thou
my
music
music
play
st
Upon
that
blessed
wood
whose
motion
sounds
With
thy
sweet
fingers
when
thou
gently
sway
st
The
wiry
concord
that
mine
ear
confounds
Do
I
envy
those
jacks
that
nimble
leap
To
kiss
the
tender
inward
of
thy
hand
Whilst
my
poor
lips
which
should
that
harvest
reap
At
the
wood
s
boldness
by
thee
blushing
stand
To
be
so
tickled
they
would
change
their
state
And
situation
with
those
dancing
chips
O
er
whom
thy
fingers
walk
with
gentle
gait
Making
dead
wood
more
blest
than
living
lips
Since
saucy
jacks
so
happy
are
in
this
Give
them
thy
fingers
me
thy
lips
to
kiss
129
Th
expense
of
spirit
in
a
waste
of
shame
Is
lust
in
action
and
till
action
lust
Is
perjured
murd
rous
bloody
full
of
blame
Savage
extreme
rude
cruel
not
to
trust
Enjoyed
no
sooner
but
despised
straight
Past
reason
hunted
and
no
sooner
had
Past
reason
hated
as
a
swallowed
bait
On
purpose
laid
to
make
the
taker
mad
Mad
in
pursuit
and
in
possession
so
Had
having
and
in
quest
to
have
extreme
A
bliss
in
proof
and
proved
a
very
woe
Before
a
joy
proposed
behind
a
dream
All
this
the
world
well
knows
yet
none
knows
well
To
shun
the
heaven
that
leads
men
to
this
hell
130
My
mistress
eyes
are
nothing
like
the
sun
Coral
is
far
more
red
than
her
lips
red
If
snow
be
white
why
then
her
breasts
are
dun
If
hairs
be
wires
black
wires
grow
on
her
head
I
have
seen
roses
damasked
red
and
white
But
no
such
roses
see
I
in
her
cheeks
And
in
some
perfumes
is
there
more
delight
Than
in
the
breath
that
from
my
mistress
reeks
I
love
to
hear
her
speak
yet
well
I
know
That
music
hath
a
far
more
pleasing
sound
I
grant
I
never
saw
a
goddess
go
My
mistress
when
she
walks
treads
on
the
ground
And
yet
by
heaven
I
think
my
love
as
rare
As
any
she
belied
with
false
compare
131
Thou
art
as
tyrannous
so
as
thou
art
As
those
whose
beauties
proudly
make
them
cruel
For
well
thou
know
st
to
my
dear
doting
heart
Thou
art
the
fairest
and
most
precious
jewel
Yet
in
good
faith
some
say
that
thee
behold
Thy
face
hath
not
the
power
to
make
love
groan
To
say
they
err
I
dare
not
be
so
bold
Although
I
swear
it
to
my
self
alone
And
to
be
sure
that
is
not
false
I
swear
A
thousand
groans
but
thinking
on
thy
face
One
on
another
s
neck
do
witness
bear
Thy
black
is
fairest
in
my
judgment
s
place
In
nothing
art
thou
black
save
in
thy
deeds
And
thence
this
slander
as
I
think
proceeds
132
Thine
eyes
I
love
and
they
as
pitying
me
Knowing
thy
heart
torment
me
with
disdain
Have
put
on
black
and
loving
mourners
be
Looking
with
pretty
ruth
upon
my
pain
And
truly
not
the
morning
sun
of
heaven
Better
becomes
the
grey
cheeks
of
the
east
Nor
that
full
star
that
ushers
in
the
even
Doth
half
that
glory
to
the
sober
west
As
those
two
mourning
eyes
become
thy
face
O
let
it
then
as
well
beseem
thy
heart
To
mourn
for
me
since
mourning
doth
thee
grace
And
suit
thy
pity
like
in
every
part
Then
will
I
swear
beauty
herself
is
black
And
all
they
foul
that
thy
complexion
lack
133
Beshrew
that
heart
that
makes
my
heart
to
groan
For
that
deep
wound
it
gives
my
friend
and
me
Is
t
not
enough
to
torture
me
alone
But
slave
to
slavery
my
sweet
st
friend
must
be
Me
from
my
self
thy
cruel
eye
hath
taken
And
my
next
self
thou
harder
hast
engrossed
Of
him
my
self
and
thee
I
am
forsaken
A
torment
thrice
three
fold
thus
to
be
crossed
Prison
my
heart
in
thy
steel
bosom
s
ward
But
then
my
friend
s
heart
let
my
poor
heart
bail
Whoe
er
keeps
me
let
my
heart
be
his
guard
Thou
canst
not
then
use
rigour
in
my
gaol
And
yet
thou
wilt
for
I
being
pent
in
thee
Perforce
am
thine
and
all
that
is
in
me
134
So
now
I
have
confessed
that
he
is
thine
And
I
my
self
am
mortgaged
to
thy
will
My
self
I
ll
forfeit
so
that
other
mine
Thou
wilt
restore
to
be
my
comfort
still
But
thou
wilt
not
nor
he
will
not
be
free
For
thou
art
covetous
and
he
is
kind
He
learned
but
surety
like
to
write
for
me
Under
that
bond
that
him
as
fist
doth
bind
The
statute
of
thy
beauty
thou
wilt
take
Thou
usurer
that
put
st
forth
all
to
use
And
sue
a
friend
came
debtor
for
my
sake
So
him
I
lose
through
my
unkind
abuse
Him
have
I
lost
thou
hast
both
him
and
me
He
pays
the
whole
and
yet
am
I
not
free
135
Whoever
hath
her
wish
thou
hast
thy
will
And
Will
to
boot
and
Will
in
over
plus
More
than
enough
am
I
that
vex
thee
still
To
thy
sweet
will
making
addition
thus
Wilt
thou
whose
will
is
large
and
spacious
Not
once
vouchsafe
to
hide
my
will
in
thine
Shall
will
in
others
seem
right
gracious
And
in
my
will
no
fair
acceptance
shine
The
sea
all
water
yet
receives
rain
still
And
in
abundance
addeth
to
his
store
So
thou
being
rich
in
will
add
to
thy
will
One
will
of
mine
to
make
thy
large
will
more
Let
no
unkind
no
fair
beseechers
kill
Think
all
but
one
and
me
in
that
one
Will
136
If
thy
soul
check
thee
that
I
come
so
near
Swear
to
thy
blind
soul
that
I
was
thy
Will
And
will
thy
soul
knows
is
admitted
there
Thus
far
for
love
my
love
suit
sweet
fulfil
Will
will
fulfil
the
treasure
of
thy
love
Ay
fill
it
full
with
wills
and
my
will
one
In
things
of
great
receipt
with
case
we
prove
Among
a
number
one
is
reckoned
none
Then
in
the
number
let
me
pass
untold
Though
in
thy
store
s
account
I
one
must
be
For
nothing
hold
me
so
it
please
thee
hold
That
nothing
me
a
something
sweet
to
thee
Make
but
my
name
thy
love
and
love
that
still
And
then
thou
lov
st
me
for
my
name
is
Will
137
Thou
blind
fool
Love
what
dost
thou
to
mine
eyes
That
they
behold
and
see
not
what
they
see
They
know
what
beauty
is
see
where
it
lies
Yet
what
the
best
is
take
the
worst
to
be
If
eyes
corrupt
by
over
partial
looks
Be
anchored
in
the
bay
where
all
men
ride
Why
of
eyes
falsehood
hast
thou
forged
hooks
Whereto
the
judgment
of
my
heart
is
tied
Why
should
my
heart
think
that
a
several
plot
Which
my
heart
knows
the
wide
world
s
common
place
Or
mine
eyes
seeing
this
say
this
is
not
To
put
fair
truth
upon
so
foul
a
face
In
things
right
true
my
heart
and
eyes
have
erred
And
to
this
false
plague
are
they
now
transferred
138
When
my
love
swears
that
she
is
made
of
truth
I
do
believe
her
though
I
know
she
lies
That
she
might
think
me
some
untutored
youth
Unlearned
in
the
world
s
false
subtleties
Thus
vainly
thinking
that
she
thinks
me
young
Although
she
knows
my
days
are
past
the
best
Simply
I
credit
her
false
speaking
tongue
On
both
sides
thus
is
simple
truth
suppressed
But
wherefore
says
she
not
she
is
unjust
And
wherefore
say
not
I
that
I
am
old
O
love
s
best
habit
is
in
seeming
trust
And
age
in
love
loves
not
to
have
years
told
Therefore
I
lie
with
her
and
she
with
me
And
in
our
faults
by
lies
we
flattered
be
139
O
call
not
me
to
justify
the
wrong
That
thy
unkindness
lays
upon
my
heart
Wound
me
not
with
thine
eye
but
with
thy
tongue
Use
power
with
power
and
slay
me
not
by
art
Tell
me
thou
lov
st
elsewhere
but
in
my
sight
Dear
heart
forbear
to
glance
thine
eye
aside
What
need
st
thou
wound
with
cunning
when
thy
might
Is
more
than
my
o
erpressed
defence
can
bide
Let
me
excuse
thee
ah
my
love
well
knows
Her
pretty
looks
have
been
mine
enemies
And
therefore
from
my
face
she
turns
my
foes
That
they
elsewhere
might
dart
their
injuries
Yet
do
not
so
but
since
I
am
near
slain
Kill
me
outright
with
looks
and
rid
my
pain
140
Be
wise
as
thou
art
cruel
do
not
press
My
tongue
tied
patience
with
too
much
disdain
Lest
sorrow
lend
me
words
and
words
express
The
manner
of
my
pity
wanting
pain
If
I
might
teach
thee
wit
better
it
were
Though
not
to
love
yet
love
to
tell
me
so
As
testy
sick
men
when
their
deaths
be
near
No
news
but
health
from
their
physicians
know
For
if
I
should
despair
I
should
grow
mad
And
in
my
madness
might
speak
ill
of
thee
Now
this
ill
wresting
world
is
grown
so
bad
Mad
slanderers
by
mad
ears
believed
be
That
I
may
not
be
so
nor
thou
belied
Bear
thine
eyes
straight
though
thy
proud
heart
go
wide
141
In
faith
I
do
not
love
thee
with
mine
eyes
For
they
in
thee
a
thousand
errors
note
But
tis
my
heart
that
loves
what
they
despise
Who
in
despite
of
view
is
pleased
to
dote
Nor
are
mine
cars
with
thy
tongue
s
tune
delighted
Nor
tender
feeling
to
base
touches
prone
Nor
taste
nor
smell
desire
to
be
invited
To
any
sensual
feast
with
thee
alone
But
my
five
wits
nor
my
five
senses
can
Dissuade
one
foolish
heart
from
serving
thee
Who
leaves
unswayed
the
likeness
of
a
man
Thy
proud
heart
s
slave
and
vassal
wretch
to
be
Only
my
plague
thus
far
I
count
my
gain
That
she
that
makes
me
sin
awards
me
pain
142
Love
is
my
sin
and
thy
dear
virtue
hate
Hate
of
my
sin
grounded
on
sinful
loving
O
but
with
mine
compare
thou
thine
own
state
And
thou
shalt
find
it
merits
not
reproving
Or
if
it
do
not
from
those
lips
of
thine
That
have
profaned
their
scarlet
ornaments
And
sealed
false
bonds
of
love
as
oft
as
mine
Robbed
others
beds
revenues
of
their
rents
Be
it
lawful
I
love
thee
as
thou
lov
st
those
Whom
thine
eyes
woo
as
mine
importune
thee
Root
pity
in
thy
heart
that
when
it
grows
Thy
pity
may
deserve
to
pitied
be
If
thou
dost
seek
to
have
what
thou
dost
hide
By
self
example
mayst
thou
be
denied
143
Lo
as
a
careful
huswife
runs
to
catch
One
of
her
feathered
creatures
broke
away
Sets
down
her
babe
and
makes
all
swift
dispatch
In
pursuit
of
the
thing
she
would
have
stay
Whilst
her
neglected
child
holds
her
in
chase
Cries
to
catch
her
whose
busy
care
is
bent
To
follow
that
which
flies
before
her
face
Not
prizing
her
poor
infant
s
discontent
So
run
st
thou
after
that
which
flies
from
thee
Whilst
I
thy
babe
chase
thee
afar
behind
But
if
thou
catch
thy
hope
turn
back
to
me
And
play
the
mother
s
part
kiss
me
be
kind
So
will
I
pray
that
thou
mayst
have
thy
Will
If
thou
turn
back
and
my
loud
crying
still
144
Two
loves
I
have
of
comfort
and
despair
Which
like
two
spirits
do
suggest
me
still
The
better
angel
is
a
man
right
fair
The
worser
spirit
a
woman
coloured
ill
To
win
me
soon
to
hell
my
female
evil
Tempteth
my
better
angel
from
my
side
And
would
corrupt
my
saint
to
be
a
devil
Wooing
his
purity
with
her
foul
pride
And
whether
that
my
angel
be
turned
fiend
Suspect
I
may
yet
not
directly
tell
But
being
both
from
me
both
to
each
friend
I
guess
one
angel
in
another
s
hell
Yet
this
shall
I
ne
er
know
but
live
in
doubt
Till
my
bad
angel
fire
my
good
one
out
145
Those
lips
that
Love
s
own
hand
did
make
Breathed
forth
the
sound
that
said
I
hate
To
me
that
languished
for
her
sake
But
when
she
saw
my
woeful
state
Straight
in
her
heart
did
mercy
come
Chiding
that
tongue
that
ever
sweet
Was
used
in
giving
gentle
doom
And
taught
it
thus
anew
to
greet
I
hate
she
altered
with
an
end
That
followed
it
as
gentle
day
Doth
follow
night
who
like
a
fiend
From
heaven
to
hell
is
flown
away
I
hate
from
hate
away
she
threw
And
saved
my
life
saying
not
you
146
Poor
soul
the
centre
of
my
sinful
earth
My
sinful
earth
these
rebel
powers
array
Why
dost
thou
pine
within
and
suffer
dearth
Painting
thy
outward
walls
so
costly
gay
Why
so
large
cost
having
so
short
a
lease
Dost
thou
upon
thy
fading
mansion
spend
Shall
worms
inheritors
of
this
excess
Eat
up
thy
charge
is
this
thy
body
s
end
Then
soul
live
thou
upon
thy
servant
s
loss
And
let
that
pine
to
aggravate
thy
store
Buy
terms
divine
in
selling
hours
of
dross
Within
be
fed
without
be
rich
no
more
So
shall
thou
feed
on
death
that
feeds
on
men
And
death
once
dead
there
s
no
more
dying
then
147
My
love
is
as
a
fever
longing
still
For
that
which
longer
nurseth
the
disease
Feeding
on
that
which
doth
preserve
the
ill
Th
uncertain
sickly
appetite
to
please
My
reason
the
physician
to
my
love
Angry
that
his
prescriptions
are
not
kept
Hath
left
me
and
I
desperate
now
approve
Desire
is
death
which
physic
did
except
Past
cure
I
am
now
reason
is
past
care
And
frantic
mad
with
evermore
unrest
My
thoughts
and
my
discourse
as
mad
men
s
are
At
random
from
the
truth
vainly
expressed
For
I
have
sworn
thee
fair
and
thought
thee
bright
Who
art
as
black
as
hell
as
dark
as
night
148
O
me
what
eyes
hath
love
put
in
my
head
Which
have
no
correspondence
with
true
sight
Or
if
they
have
where
is
my
judgment
fled
That
censures
falsely
what
they
see
aright
If
that
be
fair
whereon
my
false
eyes
dote
What
means
the
world
to
say
it
is
not
so
If
it
be
not
then
love
doth
well
denote
Love
s
eye
is
not
so
true
as
all
men
s
no
How
can
it
O
how
can
love
s
eye
be
true
That
is
so
vexed
with
watching
and
with
tears
No
marvel
then
though
I
mistake
my
view
The
sun
it
self
sees
not
till
heaven
clears
O
cunning
love
with
tears
thou
keep
st
me
blind
Lest
eyes
well
seeing
thy
foul
faults
should
find
149
Canst
thou
O
cruel
say
I
love
thee
not
When
I
against
my
self
with
thee
partake
Do
I
not
think
on
thee
when
I
forgot
Am
of
my
self
all
tyrant
for
thy
sake
Who
hateth
thee
that
I
do
call
my
friend
On
whom
frown
st
thou
that
I
do
fawn
upon
Nay
if
thou
lour
st
on
me
do
I
not
spend
Revenge
upon
my
self
with
present
moan
What
merit
do
I
in
my
self
respect
That
is
so
proud
thy
service
to
despise
When
all
my
best
doth
worship
thy
defect
Commanded
by
the
motion
of
thine
eyes
But
love
hate
on
for
now
I
know
thy
mind
Those
that
can
see
thou
lov
st
and
I
am
blind
150
O
from
what
power
hast
thou
this
powerful
might
With
insufficiency
my
heart
to
sway
To
make
me
give
the
lie
to
my
true
sight
And
swear
that
brightness
doth
not
grace
the
day
Whence
hast
thou
this
becoming
of
things
ill
That
in
the
very
refuse
of
thy
deeds
There
is
such
strength
and
warrantise
of
skill
That
in
my
mind
thy
worst
all
best
exceeds
Who
taught
thee
how
to
make
me
love
thee
more
The
more
I
hear
and
see
just
cause
of
hate
O
though
I
love
what
others
do
abhor
With
others
thou
shouldst
not
abhor
my
state
If
thy
unworthiness
raised
love
in
me
More
worthy
I
to
be
beloved
of
thee
151
Love
is
too
young
to
know
what
conscience
is
Yet
who
knows
not
conscience
is
born
of
love
Then
gentle
cheater
urge
not
my
amiss
Lest
guilty
of
my
faults
thy
sweet
self
prove
For
thou
betraying
me
I
do
betray
My
nobler
part
to
my
gross
body
s
treason
My
soul
doth
tell
my
body
that
he
may
Triumph
in
love
flesh
stays
no
farther
reason
But
rising
at
thy
name
doth
point
out
thee
As
his
triumphant
prize
proud
of
this
pride
He
is
contented
thy
poor
drudge
to
be
To
stand
in
thy
affairs
fall
by
thy
side
No
want
of
conscience
hold
it
that
I
call
Her
love
for
whose
dear
love
I
rise
and
fall
152
In
loving
thee
thou
know
st
I
am
forsworn
But
thou
art
twice
forsworn
to
me
love
swearing
In
act
thy
bed
vow
broke
and
new
faith
torn
In
vowing
new
hate
after
new
love
bearing
But
why
of
two
oaths
breach
do
I
accuse
thee
When
I
break
twenty
I
am
perjured
most
For
all
my
vows
are
oaths
but
to
misuse
thee
And
all
my
honest
faith
in
thee
is
lost
For
I
have
sworn
deep
oaths
of
thy
deep
kindness
Oaths
of
thy
love
thy
truth
thy
constancy
And
to
enlighten
thee
gave
eyes
to
blindness
Or
made
them
swear
against
the
thing
they
see
For
I
have
sworn
thee
fair
more
perjured

To
swear
against
the
truth

Cupid
laid
by
his
brand
and
fell
asleep
A
maid
of
Dian
s
this
advantage
found
And
his
love
kindling
fire
did
quickly
steep
In
a
cold
valley
fountain
of
that
ground
Which
borrowed
from
this
holy
fire
of
Love
A
dateless
lively
heat
still
to
endure
And
grew
a
seeting
bath
which
yet
men
prove
Against
strange
maladies
a
sovereign
cure
But
at
my
mistress
eye
Love
s
brand
new
fired
The
boy
for
trial
needs
would
touch
my
breast
I
sick
withal
the
help
of
bath
desired
And
thither
hied
a
sad
distempered
guest
But
found
no
cure
the
bath
for
my
help
lies
Where
Cupid
got
new
fire

mistress

The
little

Laid
by

his
heart
inflaming

Whilst
many
nymphs
that
vowed
chaste
life
to
keep
Came
tripping
by
but
in
her
maiden
hand
The
fairest
votary
took
up
that
fire
Which
many
legions
of
true
hearts
had
warmed
And
so
the
general
of
hot
desire
Was
sleeping
by
a
virgin
hand

This
