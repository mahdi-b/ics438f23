Dighton

Thus

Their

A

To

A

Decline

For

For

Thus

the

whirl

about
And
left
thee

a

prey
to

Having
no

wast
To
torture
thee

Thou

sweeter

And
he

slew

fouler

my
children
DUCHESS
Thou
toad
thou
toad
where
is
thy
brother
Clarence
And
little
Ned
Plantagenet
his
son
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Where
is
the
gentle
Rivers
Vaughan
Grey
DUCHESS
Where
is
kind
Hastings
KING
RICHARD
A
flourish
trumpets
Strike
alarum
drums
Let
not
the
heavens
hear
these
tell
tale
women
Rail
on
the
Lord
s
anointed
Strike
I
say
Flourish
Alarums
Either
be
patient
and
entreat
me
fair
Or
with
the
clamorous
report
of
war
Thus
will
I
drown
your
exclamations
DUCHESS
Art
thou
my
son
KING
RICHARD
Ay
I
thank
God
my
father
and
yourself
DUCHESS
Then
patiently
hear
my
impatience
KING
RICHARD
Madam
I
have
a
touch
of
your
condition
That
cannot
brook
the
accent
of
reproof
DUCHESS
O
let
me
speak
KING
RICHARD
Do
then
but
I
ll
not
hear
DUCHESS
I
will
be
mild
and
gentle
in
my
words
KING
RICHARD
And
brief
good
mother
for
I
am
in
haste
DUCHESS
Art
thou
so
hasty
I
have
stay
d
for
thee
God
knows
in
torment
and
in
agony
KING
RICHARD
And
came
I
not
at
last
to
comfort
you
DUCHESS
No
by
the
holy
rood
thou
know
st
it
well
Thou
cam
st
on
earth
to
make
the
earth
my
hell
A
grievous
burden
was
thy
birth
to
me
Tetchy
and
wayward
was
thy
infancy
Thy
school
days
frightful
desp
rate
wild
and
furious
Thy
prime
of
manhood
daring
bold
and
venturous
Thy
age
confirm
d
proud
subtle
sly
and
bloody
More
mild
but
yet
more
harmful
kind
in
hatred
What
comfortable
hour
canst
thou
name
That
ever
grac
d
me
with
thy
company
KING
RICHARD
Faith
none
but
Humphrey
Hour
that
call
d
your
Grace
To
breakfast
once
forth
of
my
company
If
I
be
so
disgracious
in
your
eye
Let
me
march
on
and
not
offend
you
madam
Strike
up
the
drum
DUCHESS
I
prithee
hear
me
speak
KING
RICHARD
You
speak
too
bitterly
DUCHESS
Hear
me
a
word
For
I
shall
never
speak
to
thee
again
KING
RICHARD
So
DUCHESS
Either
thou
wilt
die
by
God
s
just
ordinance
Ere
from
this
war
thou
turn
a
conqueror
Or
I
with
grief
and
extreme
age
shall
perish
And
never
more
behold
thy
face
again
Therefore
take
with
thee
my
most
grievous
curse
Which
in
the
day
of
battle
tire
thee
more
Than
all
the
complete
armour
that
thou
wear
st
My
prayers
on
the
adverse
party
fight
And
there
the
little
souls
of
Edward
s
children
Whisper
the
spirits
of
thine
enemies
And
promise
them
success
and
victory
Bloody
thou
art
bloody
will
be
thy
end
Shame
serves
thy
life
and
doth
thy
death
attend
Exit
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Though
far
more
cause
yet
much
less
spirit
to
curse
Abides
in
me
I
say
amen
to
her
KING
RICHARD
Stay
madam
I
must
talk
a
word
with
you
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
I
have
no
moe
sons
of
the
royal
blood
For
thee
to
slaughter
For
my
daughters
Richard
They
shall
be
praying
nuns
not
weeping
queens
And
therefore
level
not
to
hit
their
lives
KING
RICHARD
You
have
a
daughter
call
d
Elizabeth
Virtuous
and
fair
royal
and
gracious
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
And
must
she
die
for
this
O
let
her
live
And
I
ll
corrupt
her
manners
stain
her
beauty
Slander
myself
as
false
to
Edward
s
bed
Throw
over
her
the
veil
of
infamy
So
she
may
live
unscarr
d
of
bleeding
slaughter
I
will
confess
she
was
not
Edward
s
daughter
KING
RICHARD
Wrong
not
her
birth
she
is
a
royal
Princess
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
To
save
her
life
I
ll
say
she
is
not
so
KING
RICHARD
Her
life
is
safest
only
in
her
birth
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
And
only
in
that
safety
died
her
brothers
KING
RICHARD
Lo
at
their
birth
good
stars
were
opposite
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
No
to
their
lives
ill
friends
were
contrary
KING
RICHARD
All
unavoided
is
the
doom
of
destiny
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
True
when
avoided
grace
makes
destiny
My
babes
were
destin
d
to
a
fairer
death
If
grace
had
bless
d
thee
with
a
fairer
life
KING
RICHARD
You
speak
as
if
that
I
had
slain
my
cousins
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Cousins
indeed
and
by
their
uncle
cozen
d
Of
comfort
kingdom
kindred
freedom
life
Whose
hand
soever
lanc
d
their
tender
hearts
Thy
head
an
indirectly
gave
direction
No
doubt
the
murd
rous
knife
was
dull
and
blunt
Till
it
was
whetted
on
thy
stone
hard
heart
To
revel
in
the
entrails
of
my
lambs
But
that
stiff
use
of
grief
makes
wild
grief
tame
My
tongue
should
to
thy
ears
not
name
my
boys
Till
that
my
nails
were
anchor
d
in
thine
eyes
And
I
in
such
a
desp
rate
bay
of
death
Like
a
poor
bark
of
sails
and
tackling
reft
Rush
all
to
pieces
on
thy
rocky
bosom
KING
RICHARD
Madam
so
thrive
I
in
my
enterprise
And
dangerous
success
of
bloody
wars
As
I
intend
more
good
to
you
and
yours
Than
ever
you
or
yours
by
me
were
harm
d
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
What
good
is
cover
d
with
the
face
of
heaven
To
be
discover
d
that
can
do
me
good
KING
RICHARD
advancement
of
your
children
gentle
lady
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Up
to
some
scaffold
there
to
lose
their
heads
KING
RICHARD
Unto
the
dignity
and
height
of
Fortune
The
high
imperial
type
of
this
earth
s
glory
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Flatter
my
sorrow
with
report
of
it
Tell
me
what
state
what
dignity
what
honour
Canst
thou
demise
to
any
child
of
mine
KING
RICHARD
Even
all
I
have
ay
and
myself
and
all
Will
I
withal
endow
a
child
of
thine
So
in
the
Lethe
of
thy
angry
soul
Thou
drown
the
sad
remembrance
of
those
wrongs
Which
thou
supposest
I
have
done
to
thee
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Be
brief
lest
that
the
process
of
thy
kindness
Last
longer
telling
than
thy
kindness
date
KING
RICHARD
Then
know
that
from
my
soul
I
love
thy
daughter
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
My
daughter
s
mother
thinks
it
with
her
soul
KING
RICHARD
What
do
you
think
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
That
thou
dost
love
my
daughter
from
thy
soul
So
from
thy
soul
s
love
didst
thou
love
her
brothers
And
from
my
heart
s
love
I
do
thank
thee
for
it
KING
RICHARD
Be
not
so
hasty
to
confound
my
meaning
I
mean
that
with
my
soul
I
love
thy
daughter
And
do
intend
to
make
her
Queen
of
England
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Well
then
who
dost
thou
mean
shall
be
her
king
KING
RICHARD
Even
he
that
makes
her
Queen
Who
else
should
be
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
What
thou
KING
RICHARD
Even
so
How
think
you
of
it
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
How
canst
thou
woo
her
KING
RICHARD
That
would
I
learn
of
you
As
one
being
best
acquainted
with
her
humour
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
And
wilt
thou
learn
of
me
KING
RICHARD
Madam
with
all
my
heart
