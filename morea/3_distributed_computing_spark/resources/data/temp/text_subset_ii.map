lean
enough
to

thought
a
good
student

to
be

an
honest

darkness
CLOWN
Fie
thou
dishonest
Satan
I
call

by
the
most
modest
terms

use
the
devil
himself
with
courtesy
Say
st
thou
that
house
is
dark
MALVOLIO
As
hell
Sir
Topas
CLOWN
Why
it
hath
bay
windows
transparent

barricadoes

north
are
as
lustrous
as
ebony
and
yet
complainest
thou
of
obstruction
MALVOLIO
I
am
not
mad
Sir
Topas
I
say
to
you
this
house
is
dark
CLOWN
Madman
thou
errest
I
say
there
is
no
darkness
but
ignorance
in
which
thou
art
more
puzzled
than
the
Egyptians
in
their
fog
MALVOLIO
I
say
this
house
is
as
dark
as
ignorance
though
ignorance
were
as
dark
as
hell
and
I
say
there
was
never
man
thus

d
I
am
no
more
mad

the
trial

the
opinion
of
Pythagoras

CLOWN
What

MALVOLIO
I
think
nobly
of
the
soul
and
no
way
approve
his
opinion
CLOWN
Fare
thee
well
Remain
thou
still
in
darkness
thou
shalt
hold
th
opinion
of
Pythagoras
ere
I
will
allow
of
thy
wits

to
kill
a
woodcock

Enter
SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN
This
is
the
air
that
is
the
glorious
sun
This
pearl
she
gave
me
I
do
feel
t
and
see
t
And
though
tis
wonder
that
enwraps
me
thus
Yet
tis
not
madness
Where
s
Antonio
then
I
could
not
find
him
at
the
Elephant
Yet
there
he
was
and
there
I
found
this
credit
That
he
did
range
the
town
to
seek
me
out
His
counsel
now
might
do
me
golden
service
For
though
my
soul
disputes
well
with
my
sense
That
this
may
be
some
error
but
no
madness
Yet
doth
this
accident
and
flood
of
fortune
So
far
exceed
all
instance
all
discourse
That
I
am
ready
to
distrust
mine
eyes
And
wrangle
with
my
reason
that
persuades
me
To
any
other
trust
but
that
I
am
mad
Or
else
the
lady
s
mad
yet
if
twere
so
She
could
not
sway
her
house
command
her
followers
Take
and
give
back
affairs
and
their
dispatch
With
such
a
smooth
discreet
and
stable
bearing
As
I
perceive
she
does
There
s
something
in
t
That
is
deceivable
But
here
the
lady
comes
Enter
OLIVIA
and
PRIEST
OLIVIA
Blame
not
this
haste
of
mine
If
you
mean
well
Now
go
with
me
and
with
this
holy
man
Into
the
chantry
by
there
before
him
And
underneath
that
consecrated
roof
Plight
me
the
fun
assurance
of
your
faith
That
my
most
jealous
and
too
doubtful
soul
May
live
at
peace
He
shall
conceal
it
Whiles
you
are
willing
it
shall
come
to
note
What
time
we
will
our
celebration
keep
According
to
my
birth
What
do
you
say
SEBASTIAN
I
ll
follow
this
good
man
and
go
with
you
And
having
sworn
truth
ever
will
be
true
OLIVIA
Then
lead
the
way
good
father
and
heavens
so
shine
That
they
may
fairly
note

Why

excellent
CLOWN
By
my
troth
sir
no
though

be
one
of
my
friends
DUKE
Thou
shalt
not
be
the
worse

There

gold
CLOWN
But
that
it
would
be
double
dealing
sir
I
would
you
could
make
it
another
DUKE
O
you
give
me
ill
counsel
CLOWN
Put
your
grace
in
your
pocket
sir
for
this
once
and
let
your
flesh
and
blood
obey
it
DUKE
Well
I
will
be
so
much
a
sinner
to
be
a
double
dealer
There
s
another
CLOWN
Primo
secundo
tertio
is
a
good
play
and
the
old
saying
is
The
third
pays

The
triplex
sir
is

good
tripping
measure

Bennet

DUKE
You
can
fool
no
more
money
out

let
your

know
I
am
here

speak
with
her

bring
her
along
with

may
awake
my
bounty
further
CLOWN
Marry
sir
lullaby
to
your
bounty
till
I
come
again
I
go
sir
but
I
would
not
have
you
to
think
that
my
desire
of
having
is
the
sin
of
covetousness
But
as
you
say
sir
let
your
bounty
take
a
nap
I
will
awake
it
anon
Exit
Enter
ANTONIO
and
OFFICERS
VIOLA
Here
comes
the
man
sir
that
did
rescue
me
DUKE
That
face
of
his
I
do
remember
well
Yet
when
I
saw
it
last
it
was
besmear
d
As
black
as
Vulcan
in
the
smoke
of
war
A
baubling
vessel
was
he
captain
of
For
shallow
draught
and
bulk
unprizable
With
which
such
scathful
grapple
did
he
make
With
the
most
noble
bottom
of
our
fleet
That
very
envy
and
the
tongue
of
los
Cried
fame
and
honour
on
him
What
s
the
matter
FIRST
OFFICER
Orsino
this
is
that
Antonio
That
took
the
Phoenix
and
her
fraught
from
Candy
And
this
is
he
that
did
the
Tiger
board
When
your
young
nephew
Titus
lost
his
leg
Here
in
the
streets
desperate
of
shame
and
state
In
private
brabble
did
we
apprehend
him
VIOLA
He
did
me
kindness
sir
drew
on
my
side
But
in
conclusion
put
strange
speech
upon
me
I
know
not
what
twas
but
distraction
DUKE
Notable
pirate
thou
salt
water
thief
What
foolish
boldness
brought
thee
to
their
mercies
Whom
thou
in
terms
so
bloody
and
so
dear
Hast
made
thine
enemies
ANTONIO
Orsino
noble
sir
Be
pleas
d
that
I
shake
off
these
names
you
give
me
Antonio
never
yet
was
thief
or
pirate
Though
I
confess
on
base
and
ground
enough
Orsino
s
enemy
A
witchcraft
drew
me
hither
That
most
ingrateful
boy
there
by
your
side
From
the
rude
sea
s
enrag
d
and
foamy
mouth
Did
I
redeem
a
wreck
past
hope
he
was
His
life
I
gave
him
and
did
thereto
ad
My
love
without
retention
or
restraint
All
his
in
dedication
for
his
sake
Did
I
expose
myself
pure
for
his
love
Into
the
danger
of
this
adverse
town
Drew
to
defend
him
when
he
was
beset
Where
being
apprehended
his
false
cunning
Not
meaning
to
partake
with
me
in
danger
Taught
him
to
face
me
out
of
his
acquaintance
And
grew
a
twenty
years
removed
thing
While
one
would
wink
denied
me
mine
own
purse
Which
I
had
recommended
to
his
use
Not
half
an
hour
before
VIOLA
How
can
this
be
DUKE
When
came
he
to
this
town
ANTONIO
To

my

No

Why

Like

Egyptian

at

Kill

I

a
savage
jealousy
That
sometime
savours
nobly
But
hear

this
Since
you
to
non

cast
my
faith
And
that
I
partly
know
the
instrument
That
screws
me
from
my
true

Live

tyrant
still
But
this
your
minion
whom
I
know
you
love
And
whom
by
heaven
I
swear
I
tender
dearly
Him
will
I
tear
out
of
that
cruel
eye
Where
he
sits
crowned
in
his
master

spite
Come

my
thoughts
are
ripe
in
mischief
I

sacrifice
the

that
I

To

To
