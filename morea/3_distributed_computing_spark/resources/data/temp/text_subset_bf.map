SCENE
III
Rome
The
Forum
Enter
seven
or
eight
citizens
FIRST
CITIZEN
Once
if
he
do
require
our
voices
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
SECOND
CITIZEN
We
may
sir
if
we
will
THIRD
CITIZEN
We
have
power
in
ourselves
to
do
it
but
it
is
a
power
that
we
have
no
power
to
do
for
if
he
show
us
his
wounds
and
tell
us
his
deeds
we
are
to
put
our
tongues
into
those
wounds
and
speak
for
them
so
if
he
tell
us
his
noble
deeds
we
must
also
tell
him
our
noble
acceptance
of
them
Ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
a
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
FIRST
CITIZEN
And
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
a
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
many
headed
multitude
THIRD
CITIZEN
We
have
been
call
d
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
abram
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
colour
d
and
truly
I
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
o
th
compass
SECOND
CITIZEN
Think
you
so
Which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
THIRD
CITIZEN
Nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
man
s
will
tis
strongly
wedg
d
up
in
a
block
head
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
twould
sure
southward
SECOND
CITIZEN
Why
that
way
THIRD
CITIZEN
To
lose
itself
in
a
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
a
wife
SECOND
CITIZEN
YOU
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you
may
THIRD
CITIZEN
Are
you
all
resolv
d
to
give
your
voices
But
that
s
no
matter
the
greater
part
carries
it
I
say
if
he
would
incline
to
the
people
there
was
never
a
worthier
man
Enter
CORIOLANUS
in
a
gown
of
humility
with
MENENIUS
Here
he
comes
and
in
the
gown
of
humility
Mark
his
behaviour
We
are
not
to
stay
all
together
but
to
come
by
him
where
he
stands
by
ones
by
twos
and
by
threes
He
s
to
make
his
requests
by
particulars
wherein
every
one
of
us
has
a
single
honour
in
giving
him
our
own
voices
with
our
own
tongues
therefore
follow
me
and
I
ll
direct
you
how
you
shall
go

MENENIUS
O

The

CORIOLANUS
What
must

I

Plague

I
cannot
bring
My
tongue

a
pace
Look

wounds
I
got
them
in
my
country
s
service
when
Some
certain
of
your
brethren
roar
d
and
ran
From
th
noise
of
our
own
drums
MENENIUS
O
me
the
gods
You
must
not
speak
of
that
You
must
desire
them
To
think
upon
you
CORIOLANUS
Think
upon
me
Hang

I
would
they
would
forget
me
like
the
virtues
Which
our
divines

MENENIUS
You

I

leave
you
Pray

you
In
wholesome
manner
Exit
Re

three
of

CORIOLANUS
Bid

You

Mine

CORIOLANUS
No

THIRD
CITIZEN
YOU
MUST
think
if

give
you
anything

hope
to
gain
by

CORIOLANUS
Well
then
I
pray
your
price
o
th
consulship
FIRST
CITIZEN
The
price
is
to
ask
it
kindly
CORIOLANUS
Kindly
sir
I
pray
let
me

I
have
wounds
to
show

odd
SECOND

An

no
matter
Exeunt
the
three
citizens
Re
enter
two
other
citizens
CORIOLANUS
Pray
you
now
if
it
may
stand
with
the
tune
of
your
voices
that
I
may
be
consul
I
have
here
the
customary
gown
FOURTH
CITIZEN
You
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
CORIOLANUS
Your
enigma
FOURTH
CITIZEN
You
have
been
a
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
a
rod
to
her
friends
You
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
CORIOLANUS
You
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
I
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
I
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
a
dearer
estimation
of
them
tis
a
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
I
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
That
is
sir
I
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountiful
to
the
desirers
Therefore
beseech
you
I
may
be
consul
FIFTH
CITIZEN
We
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
FOURTH
CITIZEN
You
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
CORIOLANUS
I
will
not
seal
your
knowledge
with
showing
them
I
will
make
much
of
your
voices
and
so
trouble
you
no
farther
BOTH
CITIZENS
The
gods
give
you
joy
sir
heartily
Exeunt
citizens
CORIOLANUS
Most
sweet
voices
Better
it
is
to
die
better
to
starve
Than
crave
the
hire
which
first
we
do
deserve
Why
in
this
wolvish
toge
should
I
stand
here
To
beg
of
Hob
and
Dick
that
do
appear
Their
needless
vouches
Custom
calls
me

What
custom
wills
in
all

The

lie
unswept
And

error
be

For

Rather

Let

BRUTUS
With

His

Will

No

SECOND
CITIZEN
Not

scornfully
He

His

SICINIUS
Why
so
he
did
I
am
sure
ALL
No
no
no

THIRD
CITIZEN
He
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
And
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
I
would
be
consul
says
he
aged
custom
But
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
Your
voices
therefore
When
we
granted
that
Here
was
I
thank
you
for
your
voices
Thank
you
Your
most
sweet
voices
Now
you
have
left
your
voices
I
have
no
further
with
you
Was
not
this
mockery
SICINIUS
Why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
see
t
Or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
To
yield
your
voices
BRUTUS
Could
you
not
have
told
him
As
you
were
lesson
d
when
he
had
no
power
But
was
a
petty
servant
to
the
state
He
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
Your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
I
th
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
A
place
of
potency
and
sway
o
th
state
If
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
Fast
foe
to
th
plebeii
your
voices
might
Be
curses
to
yourselves
You
should
have
said
That
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
Than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
Would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
Translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
Standing
your
friendly
lord
SICINIUS
Thus
to
have
said
As
you
were
fore
advis
d
had
touch
d
his
spirit
And
tried
his
inclination
from
him
pluck
d
Either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
As
cause
had
call
d
you
up
have
held
him
to
Or
else
it
would
have
gall
d
his
surly
nature
Which
easily
endures
not
article
Tying
him
to
aught
So
putting
him
to
rage
You
should
have
ta
en
th
advantage
of
his
choler
And
pass
d
him
unelected
BRUTUS
Did
you
perceive
He
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
When
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
That
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
When
he
hath
power
to
crush
Why
had
your
bodies
No
heart
among
you
Or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
Against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
SICINIUS
Have
you
Ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
Of
him
that
did
not
ask

Your

Get
you
hence
instantly

tell
those

They

chose
a
consul
that
will
from
them
take
Their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
Than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
As
therefore
kept
to
do
so
SICINIUS
Let
them
assemble
And
on
a
safer
judgment
all
revoke
Your
ignorant
election
Enforce
his
pride
And
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
With
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
How
in
his
suit
he
scorn
d
you
but
your
loves
Thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
Th
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
Which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
After
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
BRUTUS
Lay
A
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
labour
d
No
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
Cast
your
election
on
him
SICINIUS
Say
you
chose
him
More
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
By
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
Pre
occupied
with
what
you
rather
must
do
Than
what
you
should

you
against

To

Lay
the
fault
on
us
BRUTUS
Ay
spare
us
not
Say
we
read
lectures
to
you
How
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
How
long
continued
and
what
stock

springs

Twice

That

To

To

found
Scaling

That

Or
all
will
fall
in
broil
CORIOLANUS
Are
these
your
herd
Must
these
have
voices
that
can
yield
them
now
And
straight
disclaim
their
tongues
What
are
your
offices
You
being
their
mouths
why
rule
you
not
their
teeth
Have
you
not
set
them
on
MENENIUS
Be
calm
be
calm
CORIOLANUS
It
is
a
purpos
d
thing
and
grows
by
plot
To
curb
the
will
of
the
nobility
Suffer
t
and
live
with
such
as
cannot
rule
Nor
ever
will
be
rul
d
BRUTUS
Call
t
not
a

The
people
cry
you
mock
d
them
and
of
late
When
corn
was
given

gratis
you
repin
d
Scandal
d
the

call
d
them
Time
pleasers
flatterers
foes
to

CORIOLANUS
Why
this
was
known
before
BRUTUS
Not
to
them
all
CORIOLANUS
Have
you
inform
d
them
sithence
BRUTUS
How
I
inform
them
COMINIUS
You
are
like
to
do
such
business
BRUTUS
Not
unlike
Each
way
to
better
yours
CORIOLANUS
Why
then
should
I
be
consul
By
yond
clouds
Let
me
deserve
so
ill
as
you
and
make
me
Your
fellow
tribune
SICINIUS
You
show
too
much
of
that
For
which
the
people
stir
if
you
will
pass
To
where
you
are
bound
you
must
enquire
your
way
Which
you
are
out
of
with
a
gentler
spirit
Or
never
be
so
noble
as
a
consul
Nor
yoke
with
him
for
tribune
MENENIUS
Let
s
be
calm
COMINIUS
The
people
are
abus
d
set
on
This
palt
ring
Becomes
not
Rome
nor
has
Coriolanus
Deserved
this
so
dishonour
d
rub
laid
falsely
I
th
plain
way
of
his
merit
CORIOLANUS
Tell
me
of
corn
This
was
my
speech
and
I
will
speak
t
again
MENENIUS
Not
now
not
now
FIRST
SENATOR
Not
in
this
heat
sir
now
CORIOLANUS
Now
as
I
live
I
will
My
nobler
friends
I
crave
their
pardons
For
the
mutable
rank
scented
meiny
let
them
Regard
me
as
I
do
not
flatter
and
Therein
behold
themselves
I
say
again
In
soothing
them
we
nourish
gainst
our
Senate
The
cockle
of
rebellion
insolence
sedition
Which
we
ourselves
have
plough
d
for
sow
d
and
scatter
d
By
mingling
them
with
us
the
honour
d
number
Who
lack
not
virtue
no
nor
power
but
that
Which
they
have
given
to
beggars
MENENIUS
Well
no
more
FIRST
SENATOR
No
more
words
we
beseech
you
CORIOLANUS
How
no
more
As
for
my
country
I
have
shed
my
blood
Not
fearing
outward
force
so
shall
my
lungs
Coin
words
till
their
decay
against
those
measles
Which
we
disdain
should
tetter
us
yet
sought
The
very
way
to
catch
them
BRUTUS
You
speak
o
th
people
As
if
you
were
a
god
to
punish
not
A
man
of
their
infirmity
SICINIUS
Twere
well
We
let
the
people
know
t
MENENIUS
What
what
his
choler
CORIOLANUS
Choler
Were
I
as
patient
as
the
midnight
sleep
By
Jove
twould
be
my
mind
SICINIUS
It
is
a
mind
That
shall
remain
a
poison
where
it
is
Not
poison
any
further
CORIOLANUS
Shall
remain
Hear
you
this
Triton
of
the
minnows
Mark
you
His
absolute
shall
COMINIUS
Twas
from
the
canon
CORIOLANUS
Shall
O
good
but
most
unwise
patricians
Why
You
grave
but
reckless
senators
have
you
thus
Given
Hydra
here
to
choose
an
officer
That
with
his
peremptory
shall
being
but
The
horn
and
noise
o
th
monster
s
wants
not
spirit
To
say
he
ll
turn
your
current
in
a
ditch
And
make
your
channel
his
If
he
have
power
Then
vail
your
ignorance
if
none
awake
Your
dangerous
lenity
If
you
are
learn
d
Be
not
as
common
fools
if
you
are
not
Let
them
have
cushions
by
you
You
are
plebeians
If
they
be
senators
and
they
are
no
less
When
both
your
voices
blended
the
great
st
taste
Most
palates
theirs
They
choose
their
magistrate
And
such
a
one
as
he
who
puts
his
shall
His
popular
shall
against
a
graver
bench
Than
ever
frown
d
in
Greece
By
Jove
himself
It
makes
the
consuls
base
and
my
soul
aches
To
know
when
two
authorities
are
up
Neither
supreme
how
soon
confusion
May
enter
twixt
the
gap
of
both
and
take
The
one
by
th
other
COMINIUS
Well
on
to
th
market
place
CORIOLANUS
Whoever
gave
that
counsel
to
give
forth
The
corn
o
th
storehouse
gratis
as
twas
us
d
Sometime
in
Greece
MENENIUS
Well
well
no
more
of
that
CORIOLANUS
Though
there
the
people
had
more
absolute
pow
r
I
say
they
nourish
d
disobedience
fed
The
ruin
of
the
state
BRUTUS
Why
shall
the
people
give
One
that
speaks
thus
their
voice
CORIOLANUS
I
ll
give
my
reasons
More
worthier
than
their
voices
They
know
the
corn
Was
not
our
recompense
resting
well
assur
d
They
ne
er
did
service
for
t
being
press
d
to
th
war
Even
when
the
navel
of
the
state
was
touch
d
They
would
not
thread
the
gates
This
kind
of
service
Did
not
deserve
corn
gratis
Being
i
th
war
Their
mutinies
and
revolts
wherein
they
show
d
Most
valour
spoke
not
for
them
Th
accusation
Which
they
have
often
made
against
the
Senate
All
cause
unborn
could
never
be
the
native
Of
our
so
frank
donation
Well
what
then
How
shall
this
bosom
multiplied
digest
The
Senate
s
courtesy
Let
deeds
express
What
s
like
to
be
their
words
We
did
request
it
We
are
the
greater
poll
and
in
true
fear
They
gave
us
our
demands
Thus
we
debase
The
nature
of
our
seats
and
make
the
rabble
Call
our
cares
fears
which
will
in
time
Break
ope
the
locks
o
th
Senate
and
bring
in
The
crows
to
peck
the
eagles
MENENIUS
Come
enough
BRUTUS
Enough
with
over
measure
CORIOLANUS
No
take
more
What
may
be
sworn
by
both
divine
and
human
Seal
what
I
end
withal
This
double
worship
Where
one
part
does
disdain
with
cause
the
other
Insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
Cannot
conclude
but
by
the
yea
and
no
Of
general
ignorance
it
must
omit
Real
necessities
and
give
way
the
while
To
unstable
slightness
Purpose
so
barr
d
it
follows
Nothing
is
done
to
purpose
Therefore
beseech
you
You
that
will
be
less
fearful
than
discreet
That
love
the
fundamental
part
of
state
More
than
you
doubt
the
change
on
t
that
prefer
A
noble
life
before
a
long
and
wish
To
jump
a
body
with
a
dangerous
physic
That
s
sure
of
death
without
it
at
once
pluck
out
The
multitudinous
tongue
let
them
not
lick
The
sweet
which
is
their
poison
Your
dishonour
Mangles
true
judgment
and
bereaves
the
state
Of
that
integrity
which
should
become
t
Not
having
the
power
to
do
the
good
it
would
For
th
ill
which
doth
control
t
BRUTUS
Has
said
enough
SICINIUS
Has
spoken
like
a
traitor
and
shall
answer
As
traitors
do
CORIOLANUS
Thou
wretch
despite
o
erwhelm
thee
What
should
the
people
do
with
these
bald
tribunes
On
whom
depending
their
obedience
fails
To
the
greater
bench
In
a
rebellion
When
what
s
not
meet
but
what
must
be
was
law
Then
were
they
chosen
in
a
better
hour
Let
what
is
meet
be
said
it
must
be
meet
And
throw
their
power
i
th
dust
BRUTUS
Manifest
treason
