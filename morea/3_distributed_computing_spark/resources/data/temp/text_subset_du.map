A

And

Saba

All

With

The

As

When

Wherever

His

and
made
whole
With
very
easy
arguments
of
love
Which
now
the
manage
of
two
kingdoms
must
With
fearful
bloody
issue
arbitrate
KING
JOHN
Our
strong
possession
and
our
right
for
us
ELINOR
Your
strong
possession
much
more
than
your
right
Or
else
it
must
go
wrong
with
you
and
me
So
much
my
conscience
whispers
in
your
ear
Which
none
but
heaven
and
you
and
I
shall
hear
Enter
a
SHERIFF
ESSEX
My
liege
here
is
the
strangest
controversy
Come
from
the
country
to
be
judg
d
by
you
That
e
er
I
heard
Shall
I
produce
the
men
KING
JOHN
Let
them
approach
Exit
SHERIFF
Our
abbeys
and
our
priories
shall
pay
This
expedition
s
charge
Enter
ROBERT
FAULCONBRIDGE
and
PHILIP
his
bastard
brother
What
men
are
you
BASTARD
Your
faithful
subject
I
a
gentleman
Born
in
Northamptonshire
and
eldest
son
As
I
suppose
to
Robert
Faulconbridge
A
soldier
by
the
honour
giving
hand
Of
Coeur
de
lion
knighted
in
the
field
KING
JOHN
What
art
thou
ROBERT
The
son
and
heir
to
that
same
Faulconbridge
KING
JOHN
Is
that
the
elder
and
art
thou
the
heir
You
came
not
of
one
mother
then
it
seems
BASTARD
Most
certain
of
one
mother
mighty
king
That
is
well
known
and
as
I
think
one
father
But
for
the
certain
knowledge
of
that
truth
I
put
you
o
er
to
heaven
and
to
my
mother
Of
that
I
doubt
as
all
men
s
children
may
ELINOR
Out
on
thee
rude
man
Thou
dost
shame
thy
mother
And
wound
her
honour
with
this
diffidence
BASTARD
I
madam
No
I
have
no
reason
for
it
That
is
my
brother
s
plea
and
none
of
mine
The
which
if
he
can
prove
a
pops
me
out
At
least
from
fair
five
hundred
pound
a
year
Heaven
guard
my
mother
s
honour
and
my
land
KING
JOHN
A
good
blunt
fellow
Why
being
younger
born
Doth
he
lay
claim
to
thine
inheritance
BASTARD
I
know
not
why
except
to
get
the
land
But
once
he
slander
d
me
with
bastardy
But
whe
er
I
be
as
true
begot
or
no
That
still
I
lay
upon
my
mother
s
head
But
that
I
am
as
well
begot
my
liege
Fair
fall
the
bones
that
took
the
pains
for
me
Compare
our
faces
and
be
judge
yourself
If
old
Sir
Robert
did
beget
us
both
And
were
our
father
and
this
son
like
him
O
old
Sir
Robert
father
on
my
knee
I
give
heaven
thanks
I
was
not
like
to
thee
KING
JOHN
Why
what
a
madcap
hath
heaven
lent
us
here
ELINOR
He
hath
a
trick
of
Coeur
de
lion
s
face
The
accent
of
his
tongue
affecteth
him
Do
you
not
read
some
tokens
of
my
son
In
the
large
composition
of
this
man
KING
JOHN
Mine
eye
hath
well
examined
his
parts
And
finds
them
perfect
Richard
Sirrah
speak
What
doth
move
you
to
claim
your
brother
s
land
BASTARD
Because
he
hath
a
half
face
like
my
father
With
half
that
face
would
he
have
all
my
land
A
half
fac
d
groat
five
hundred
pound
a
year
ROBERT
My
gracious
liege
when
that
my
father
liv
d
Your
brother
did
employ
my
father
much
BASTARD
Well
sir
by
this
you
cannot
get
my
land
Your
tale
must
be
how
he
employ
d
my
mother
ROBERT
And
once
dispatch
d
him
in
an
embassy
To
Germany
there
with
the
Emperor
To
treat
of
high
affairs
touching
that
time
Th
advantage
of
his
absence
took
the
King
And
in
the
meantime
sojourn
d
at
my
father
s
Where
how
he
did
prevail
I
shame
to
speak
But
truth
is
truth
large
lengths
of
seas
and
shores
Between
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
As
I
have
heard
my
father
speak
himself
When
this
same
lusty
gentleman
was
got
Upon
his
death
bed
he
by
will
bequeath
d
His
lands
to
me
and
took
it
on
his
death
That
this
my
mother
s
son
was
none
of
his
And
if
he
were
he
came
into
the
world
Full
fourteen
weeks
before
the
course
of
time
Then
good
my
liege
let
me
have
what
is
mine
My
father
s
land
as
was
my
father
s
will
KING
JOHN
Sirrah
your
brother
is
legitimate
Your
father
s
wife
did
after
wedlock
bear
him
And
if
she
did
play
false
the
fault
was
hers
Which
fault
lies
on
the
hazards
of
all
husbands
That
marry
wives
Tell
me
how
if
my
brother
Who
as
you
say
took
pains
to
get
this
son
Had
of
your
father
claim
d
this
son
for
his
In
sooth
good
friend
your
father
might
have
kept
This
calf
bred
from
his
cow
from
all
the
world
In
sooth
he
might
then
if
he
were
my
brother
s
My
brother
might
not
claim
him
nor
your
father
Being
none
of
his
refuse
him
This
concludes
My
mother
s
son
did
get
your
father
s
heir
Your
father
s
heir
must
have
your
father
s
land
ROBERT
Shall
then
my
father
s
will
be
of
no
force
To
dispossess
that
child
which
is
not
his
BASTARD
Of
no
more
force
to
dispossess
me
sir
Than
was
his
will
to
get
me
as
I
think
ELINOR
Whether
hadst
thou
rather
be
a
Faulconbridge
And
like
thy
brother
to
enjoy
thy
land
Or
the
reputed
son
of
Coeur
de
lion
Lord
of
thy
presence
and
no
land
beside
BASTARD
Madam
an
if
my
brother
had
my
shape
And
I
had
his
Sir
Robert
s
his
like
him
And
if
my
legs
were
two
such
riding
rods
My
arms
such
eel
skins
stuff
d
my
face
so
thin
That
in
mine
ear
I
durst
not
stick
a
rose
Lest
men
should
say
Look
where
three
farthings
goes
And
to
his
shape
were
heir
to
all
this
land
Would
I
might
never
stir
from
off
this
place
I
would
give
it
every
foot
to
have
this
face
I
would
not
be
Sir
Nob
in
any
case
ELINOR
I
like
thee
well
Wilt
thou
forsake
thy
fortune
Bequeath
thy
land
to
him
and
follow
me
I
am
a
soldier
and
now
bound
to
France
BASTARD
Brother
take

Yet

fivepence

Madam
