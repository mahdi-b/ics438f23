Do
not
omit
the
heavy
offer
of
it
It
seldom
visits
sorrow
when
it
doth
It
is
a
comforter
ANTONIO
We
two
my
lord
Will
guard
your
person
while
you
take
your
rest
And
watch
your
safety
ALONSO
Thank
you
wondrous
heavy
ALONSO
sleeps
Exit
ARIEL
SEBASTIAN
What
a
strange
drowsiness
possesses
them
ANTONIO
It
is
the
quality
o
th
climate
SEBASTIAN
Why
Doth
it
not
then
our
eyelids
sink
I
find
not
Myself
dispos
d
to
sleep
ANTONIO
Nor
I
my
spirits
are
nimble
They
fell
together
all
as
by
consent
They
dropp
d
as
by
a
thunder
stroke
What
might
Worthy
Sebastian
O
what
might
No
more
And
yet
methinks
I
see
it
in
thy
face
What
thou
shouldst
be
th
occasion
speaks
thee
and
My
strong
imagination
sees
a
crown
Dropping
upon
thy
head
SEBASTIAN
What
art
thou
waking
ANTONIO
Do
you
not
hear
me
speak
SEBASTIAN
I
do
and
surely
It
is
a
sleepy
language
and
thou
speak
st
Out
of
thy
sleep
What
is
it
thou
didst
say
This
is
a
strange
repose
to
be
asleep
With
eyes
wide
open
standing
speaking
moving
And
yet
so
fast
asleep
ANTONIO
Noble
Sebastian
Thou
let
st
thy
fortune
sleep
die
rather
wink
st
Whiles
thou
art
waking
SEBASTIAN
Thou
dost
snore
distinctly
There
s
meaning
in
thy
snores
ANTONIO
I
am
more
serious
than
my
custom
you
Must
be
so
too
if
heed
me
which
to
do
Trebles
thee
o
er
SEBASTIAN
Well
I
am
standing
water
ANTONIO
I
ll
teach
you
how
to
flow
SEBASTIAN
Do
so
to
ebb
Hereditary
sloth
instructs
me
ANTONIO
O
If
you
but
knew
how
you
the
purpose
cherish
Whiles
thus
you
mock
it
how
in
stripping
it
You
more
invest
it
Ebbing
men
indeed
Most
often
do
so
near
the
bottom
run
By
their
own
fear
or
sloth
SEBASTIAN
Prithee
say
on
The
setting
of
thine
eye
and
cheek
proclaim
A
matter
from
thee
and
a
birth
indeed
Which
throes
thee
much
to
yield
ANTONIO
Thus
sir
Although
this
lord
of
weak
remembrance
this
Who
shall
be
of
as
little
memory
When
he
is
earth
d
hath
here
almost
persuaded
For
he
s
a
spirit
of
persuasion
only
Professes
to
persuade
the
King
his
son
s
alive
Tis
as
impossible
that
he
s
undrown
d
As
he
that
sleeps
here
swims
SEBASTIAN
I
have
no
hope
That
he
s
undrown
d
ANTONIO
O
out
of
that
no
hope
What
great
hope
have
you
No
hope
that
way
is
Another
way
so
high
a
hope
that
even
Ambition
cannot
pierce
a
wink
beyond
But
doubt
discovery
there
Will
you
grant
with
me
That
Ferdinand
is
drown
d
SEBASTIAN
He
s
gone
ANTONIO
Then
tell
me
Who
s
the
next
heir
of
Naples
SEBASTIAN
Claribel
ANTONIO
She
that
is
Queen
of
Tunis
she
that
dwells
Ten
leagues
beyond
man
s
life
she
that
from
Naples
Can
have
no
note
unless
the
sun
were
post
The
Man
i
th
Moon
s
too
slow
till
newborn

Be
rough
and
razorable
she
that
from
whom
We
all
were
sea
swallow
d
though
some
cast
again
And
by
that
destiny
to
perform
an
act
Whereof
what
s
past
is
prologue
what
to
come
In
yours
and
my
discharge
SEBASTIAN
What
stuff
is
this
How
say
you
Tis
true
my
brother
s
daughter
s
Queen
of
Tunis
So
is
she
heir
of
Naples
twixt
which
regions
There
is
some
space
ANTONIO
A
space
whose
ev
ry
cubit
Seems
to
cry
out
How
shall
that
Claribel
Measure
us
back
to
Naples
Keep
in
Tunis
And
let
Sebastian
wake
Say
this
were
death
That
now
hath
seiz

why
they
were
no
worse
Than
now
they
are
There

rule
Naples
As
well
as
he
that
sleeps
lords
that
can
prate
As
amply
and
unnecessarily
As
this
Gonzalo
I
myself
could
make
A
chough
of
as
deep
chat
O
that
you
bore
The
mind
that
I
do
What
a
sleep
were
this
For
your
advancement
Do
you
understand
me
SEBASTIAN
Methinks
I
do
ANTONIO
And
how
does
your
content
Tender
your
own
good
fortune
SEBASTIAN
I
remember
You
did
supplant
your
brother
Prospero
ANTONIO
True
And
look
how
well
my
garments
sit
upon
me
Much
feater
than
before
My
brother
s
servants
Were
then
my
fellows
now
they
are
my
men
SEBASTIAN
But
for
your
conscience
ANTONIO
Ay
sir
where
lies
that
If
twere
a
kibe
Twould
put
me
to
my
slipper
but
I
feel
not
This
deity
in
my
bosom
twenty
consciences
That
stand
twixt
me

Milan
candied
be
they
And
melt
ere

Here
lies
your
brother
No
better
than
the
earth
he
lies
upon
If
he
were
that
which
now
he
s
like
that

dead
Whom
I
with
this
obedient
steel
three
inches
of

Can

for

whiles

To

This

Sir
Prudence
who
Should

For

They

They

SEBASTIAN
Thy

Shall
be
my
precedent
as

Milan
I

Draw

One

They

ARIEL
My

For

GONZALO
What

matter
SEBASTIAN
Whiles
we
stood
here
securing
your
repose
Even
now
we
heard
a
hollow
burst
of
bellowing
Like
bulls
or
rather
lions
did
t
not
wake
you
It
struck
mine
ear
most
terribly
ALONSO
I
heard
nothing
ANTONIO
O
twas
a
din
to
fright
a
monster

To
make
an
earthquake
Sure
it
was
the
roar
Of
a
whole
herd
of
lions
ALONSO
Heard
you
this
Gonzalo
GONZALO
Upon
mine
honour
sir
I
heard
a
humming
And

a
strange
one

I
shak
d
you

and
cried
as
mine

I
saw
their
weapons

a
noise
That

verily
Tis

Or
that

Let

ALONSO
Lead

For

From

By

His

But

Fright

Out

For
every

Sometime

apes
that

And
after
bite
me
then
like
hedgehogs
which
Lie
tumbling
in
my
barefoot

Their

Do

Yond

Thunder
Alas

My

SCENE
1
Before
PROSPERO
S
cell
Enter
FERDINAND
hearing
a
log
FERDINAND
There
be
some
sports
are
painful
and
their
labour
Delight
in
them
sets
off
some
kinds
of
baseness
Are
nobly
undergone
and
most
poor
matters
Point
to
rich
ends
This
my
mean
task
Would
be
as
heavy
to
me
as
odious
but
The
mistress
which
I
serve
quickens
what
s
dead
And
makes
my
labours
pleasures
O
she
is
Ten
times
more
gentle
than
her
father
s
crabbed
And
he
s
compos
d
of
harshness
I
must
remove
Some
thousands
of
these
logs
and
pile
them
up
Upon
a
sore
injunction
my
sweet
mistress
Weeps
when
she
sees
me
work
and
says
such
baseness
Had
never
like
executor
I
forget
But
these
sweet
thoughts
do
even
refresh
my
labours
Most
busy
least
when
I
do
it
Enter
MIRANDA
and
PROSPERO
at
a
distance
unseen
MIRANDA
Alas
now
pray
you
Work
not
so
hard
I
would
the
lightning
had
Burnt
up
those
logs
that
you
are
enjoin
d
to
pile
Pray
set
it
down
and
rest
you
when
this
burns
Twill
weep
for
having
wearied
you
My
father
Is
hard
at
study
pray
now
rest
yourself
He
s
safe
for
these
three
hours
FERDINAND
O
most
dear
mistress
The
sun
will
set
before
I
shall
discharge
What
I
must
strive
to
do
MIRANDA
If
you
ll
sit
down
I
ll
bear
your
logs
the
while
pray
give
me
that
I
ll
carry
it
to
the
pile
FERDINAND
No
precious
creature
I
had
rather
crack
my
sinews
break
my
back
Than
you
should
such
dishonour
undergo
While
I
sit
lazy
by
MIRANDA
It
would
become
me
As
well
as
it
does
you
and
I
should
do
it
With
much
more
ease
for
my
good
will
is
to
it
And
yours
it
is
against
PROSPERO
Aside
Poor
worm
thou
art
infected
This
visitation
shows
it
MIRANDA
You
look
wearily
FERDINAND
No
noble
mistress
tis
fresh
morning
with
me
When
you
are
by
at
night
I
do
beseech
you
Chiefly
that
I
might
set
it
in
my
prayers
What
is
your
name
MIRANDA
Miranda
O
my
father
I
have
broke
your
hest
to
say
so
FERDINAND
Admir
d
Miranda
What
s
dearest
to
the
world
Full
many
a
lady
I
have
ey
d
with
best
regard
and
many
a
time
Th
harmony
of
their
tongues
hath
into
bondage
Brought
my
too
diligent
ear
for
several
virtues
Have
I
lik
d
several
women
never
any
With
so
full
soul
but
some
defect
in
her
Did
quarrel
with
the
noblest
grace
she
ow
d
And
put
it
to
the
foil
but
you
O
you
So
perfect
and
so
peerless
are
created
Of
every
creature
s
best
MIRANDA
I
do
not
know
One
of
my
sex
no
woman
s
face
remember
Save
from
my
glass
mine
own
nor
have
I
seen
More
that
I
may
call
men
than
you
good
friend
And
my
dear
father
How
features
are
abroad
I
am
skilless
of
but
by
my
modesty
The
jewel
in
my
dower
I
would
not
wish
Any
companion
in
the
world
but
you
Nor
can
imagination
form
a
shape
Besides
yourself
to
like
of
But
I
prattle
Something
too
wildly
and
my
father
s
precepts
I
therein
do
forget
FERDINAND
I
am
in
my
condition
A
prince
Miranda
I
do
think
a
king
I
would
not
so
and
would
no
more
endure
This
wooden
slavery
than
to
suffer
The
flesh
fly
blow
my
mouth
Hear
my
soul
speak
The
very
instant
that
I
saw
you
did
My
heart
fly
to
your
service
there
resides
To
make
me
slave
to
it
and
for
your
sake
Am
I
this
patient
log
man
MIRANDA
Do
you
love
me
FERDINAND
O
heaven
O
earth
bear
witness
to
this
sound
And
crown
what
I
profess
with
kind
event
If
I
speak
true
If
hollowly
invert
What
best
is
boded
me
to
mischief
I
Beyond
all
limit
of
what
else
i
th
world
Do
love
prize
honour
you
MIRANDA
I
am
a
fool
To
weep
at
what
I
am
glad
of
PROSPERO
Aside
Fair
encounter
Of
two
most
rare
affections
Heavens
rain
grace
On
that
which
breeds
between
em
FERDINAND
Wherefore
weep
you
MIRANDA
At
mine
unworthiness
that
dare
not
offer
What
I
desire
to
give
and
much
less
take
What
I
shall
die
to
want
But
this
is
trifling
And
all
the
more
it
seeks
to
hide
itself
The
bigger
bulk
it
shows
Hence
bashful
cunning
And
prompt
me
plain
and
holy
innocence
I
am
your
wife
if
you
will
marry
me
If
not
I
ll
die
your
maid
To
be
your
fellow
You
may
deny
me
but
I
ll
be
your
servant
Whether
you
will
or
no
FERDINAND
My
mistress

And

As
