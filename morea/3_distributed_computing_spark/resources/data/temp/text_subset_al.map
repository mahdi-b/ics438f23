great
spirit
gone
Thus
did
I
desire
it
What
our
contempts
doth
often
hurl
from
us
We
wish
it
ours
again
the
present
pleasure
By
revolution
low
ring
does
become
The
opposite
of
itself
She
s
good
being
gone
The
hand
could
pluck
her
back
that
shov
d
her
on
I
must
from
this
enchanting
queen
break
off
Ten
thousand
harms
more
than

know
My

doth
hatch
How
now
Enobarbus
Re
enter
ENOBARBUS
ENOBARBUS
What
s
your
pleasure
sir
ANTONY
I
must
with
haste
from
hence
ENOBARBUS
Why
then
we
kill
all
our
women
We
see
how
mortal
an
unkindness
is
to
them
if
they
suffer
our
departure
death
s
the
word
ANTONY
I
must
be
gone
ENOBARBUS
Under
a
compelling
occasion
let
women
die
It
were
pity
to
cast
them
away
for
nothing
though
between
them
and
a
great
cause
they
should
be
esteemed
nothing
Cleopatra
catching
but
the
least
noise
of
this
dies
instantly
I
have
seen
her
die
twenty
times
upon
far
poorer
moment
I
do
think
there
is
mettle
in
death
which
commits
some
loving
act
upon
her
she
hath
such
a
celerity
in
dying
ANTONY
She
is
cunning
past
man
s
thought
ENOBARBUS
Alack
sir
no
Her
passions
are
made
of
nothing
but
the
finest
part
of
pure
love
We
cannot
call
her
winds
and
waters
sighs
and
tears
they
are
greater
storms
and
tempests
than
almanacs
can
report
This
cannot
be
cunning
in
her
if
it
be
she
makes
a
show
r
of
rain
as
well
as
Jove
ANTONY
Would
I
had
never
seen
her
ENOBARBUS
O
Sir
you
had
then
left
unseen
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
which
not
to
have
been
blest
withal
would
have
discredited
your
travel
ANTONY
Fulvia
is
dead
ENOBARBUS
Sir
ANTONY
Fulvia
is
dead
ENOBARBUS
Fulvia
ANTONY
Dead
ENOBARBUS
Why
sir
give
the
gods
a
thankful
sacrifice
When
it
pleaseth
their
deities
to
take
the
wife
of
a
man
from
him
it
shows
to
man
the
tailors
of
the
earth
comforting
therein
that
when
old
robes
are
worn
out
there
are
members
to
make
new
If
there
were
no
more
women
but
Fulvia
then
had
you
indeed
a
cut
and
the
case
to
be
lamented
This
grief
is
crown
d
with
consolation
your
old
smock
brings
forth
a
new
petticoat
and
indeed
the
tears
live
in
an
onion
that
should
water
this
sorrow
ANTONY
The
business
she
hath
broached
in
the
state
Cannot
endure
my
absence
ENOBARBUS
And
the
business
you
have
broach
d
here
cannot
be
without
you
especially
that
of
Cleopatra
s
which
wholly
depends
on
your
abode
ANTONY
No
more
light
answers
Let
our
officers
Have
notice
what
we
purpose
I
shall
break
The
cause
of
our
expedience
to
the
Queen
And
get
her

to

For
not

The
death

him
sad
Say
I
am
dancing
if
in
mirth
report
That
I
am
sudden
sick
Quick
and
return
Exit
ALEXAS
CHARMIAN
Madam
methinks
if
you
did
love
him
dearly
You
do
not
hold
the
method
to
enforce
The
like
from
him
CLEOPATRA
What
should
I
do
I
do
not
CHARMIAN
In
each
thing
give
him
way
cross
him
in
nothing
CLEOPATRA
Thou
teachest
like
a
fool
the
way
to
lose
him
CHARMIAN
Tempt
him
not
so
too
far
I
wish
forbear
In
time
we
hate
that
which
we
often
fear
Enter
ANTONY
But
here
comes
Antony
CLEOPATRA
I
am
sick
and
sullen
ANTONY
I
am
sorry
to
give
breathing
to
my
purpose
CLEOPATRA
Help
me
away
dear
Charmian
I
shall
fall
It
cannot
be
thus
long
the
sides
of
nature
Will
not
sustain
it
ANTONY
Now
my
dearest
queen
CLEOPATRA
Pray
you
stand
farther
from
me
ANTONY
What
s
the
matter
CLEOPATRA
I
know
by
that
same
eye
there
s
some
good
news
What
says
the
married
woman
You
may
go
Would
she
had
never
given
you
leave
to
come
Let
her
not
say
tis
I
that
keep
you
here
I
have
no
power
upon
you
hers
you
are
ANTONY
The
gods
best
know
CLEOPATRA
O
never
was
there
queen
So
mightily
betray
d
Yet
at
the
first
I
saw
the
treasons
planted
ANTONY
Cleopatra
CLEOPATRA
Why
should
I
think
you
can
be
mine
and
true
Though
you
in
swearing
shake
the
throned
gods
Who
have
been
false
to
Fulvia
Riotous
madness
To
be
entangled
with
those
mouth
made
vows
Which
break
themselves
in
swearing
ANTONY
Most
sweet
queen
CLEOPATRA
Nay
pray
you
seek
no
colour
for
your
going
But
bid
farewell
and
go
When
you
sued
staying
Then
was
the
time
for
words
No
going
then
Eternity
was
in
our
lips
and
eyes
Bliss
in
our
brows
bent
none
our
parts
so
poor
But
was
a
race
of
heaven
They
are
so
still
Or
thou
the
greatest
soldier
of
the
world
Art
turn
d
the
greatest
liar
ANTONY
How
now
lady
CLEOPATRA
I
would
I
had
thy
inches
Thou
shouldst
know
There
were
a
heart
in
Egypt
ANTONY
Hear
me
queen
The
strong
necessity
of
time
commands
Our
services
awhile
but
my
full
heart
Remains
in
use
with
you
Our
Italy
Shines
o
er
with
civil
swords
Sextus
Pompeius
Makes
his
approaches
to
the
port
of
Rome
Equality
of
two
domestic
powers
Breed
scrupulous
faction
the
hated
grown
to
strength
Are
newly
grown
to
love
The
condemn
d
Pompey
Rich
in
his
father
s
honour
creeps
apace
Into
the
hearts
of
such
as
have
not
thrived
Upon
the
present
state
whose
numbers
threaten
And
quietness
grown
sick
of
rest
would
purge
By
any
desperate
change
My
more
particular
And
that
which
most
with
you
should
safe
my
going
Is
Fulvia
s
death
CLEOPATRA
Though
age
from
folly
could
not
give
me
freedom
It
does
from
childishness
Can
Fulvia
die
ANTONY
She
s
dead
my
Queen
Look
here
and
at
thy
sovereign
leisure
read
The
garboils
she
awak
d
At
the
last
best
See
when
and
where
she
died
CLEOPATRA
O
most
false
love
Where
be
the
sacred
vials
thou
shouldst
fill
With
sorrowful
water
Now
I
see
I
see
In
Fulvia
s
death
how
mine
receiv
d
shall
be
ANTONY
Quarrel
no
more
but
be
prepar
d
to
know
The
purposes
I
bear
which
are
or
cease
As
you
shall
give
th
advice
By
the
fire
That
quickens
Nilus
slime
I
go
from
hence
Thy
soldier
servant
making
peace
or
war
As
thou
affects
CLEOPATRA
Cut
my
lace
Charmian
come
But
let
it
be
I
am
quickly
ill
and
well
So
Antony
loves
ANTONY
My
precious
queen
forbear
And
give
true
evidence
to
his
love
which
stands
An
honourable
trial
CLEOPATRA
So
Fulvia
told
me
I
prithee
turn
aside
and
weep
for
her
Then
bid
adieu
to
me
and
say
the
tears
Belong
to
Egypt
Good
now
play
one
scene
Of
excellent
dissembling
and
let
it
look
Like
perfect
honour
ANTONY
You
ll
heat
my
blood
no
more
CLEOPATRA
You
can
do
better
yet
but
this
is
meetly
ANTONY
Now
by
my
sword
CLEOPATRA
And
target
Still
he
mends
But
this
is
not
the
best
Look
prithee
Charmian
How
this
Herculean
Roman
does
become
The
carriage
of
his
chafe
ANTONY
I
ll
leave
you
lady
CLEOPATRA
Courteous
lord
one
word
Sir
you
and
I
must
part
but
that
s
not
it
Sir
you
and
I
have
lov
d
but
there
s
not
it
That
you
know
well
Something
it
is
I
would
O
my
oblivion
is
a
very
Antony
And
I
am
all
forgotten
ANTONY
But
that
your
royalty
Holds
idleness
your
subject
I
should
take
you
For
idleness
itself
CLEOPATRA
Tis
sweating
labour
To
bear
such
idleness
so
near
the
heart
As
Cleopatra
this
But
sir
forgive
me
Since
my
becomings
kill
me
when
they
do
not
Eye
well
to
you
Your
honour
calls
you
hence
Therefore
be
deaf
to
my
unpitied
folly
And
all
the
gods
go
with
you
Upon
your
sword
Sit
laurel
victory
and
smooth
success
Be
strew
d
before
your
feet
ANTONY
Let
us
go
Come
Our
separation
so
abides
and
flies
That
thou
residing
here
goes
yet
with
me
And
I
hence
fleeting
here
remain
with
thee
Away
Exeunt
SCENE
IV
Rome
CAESAR
S
house
Enter
OCTAVIUS
CAESAR
reading
a
letter
LEPIDUS
and
their
train
CAESAR
You
may
see
Lepidus
and
henceforth
know
It
is
not
Caesar
s
natural
vice
to
hate
Our
great
competitor
From
Alexandria
This
is
the
news
he
fishes
drinks
and
wastes
The
lamps
of
night
in
revel
is
not
more
manlike
Than
Cleopatra
nor
the
queen
of
Ptolemy
More
womanly
than
he
hardly
gave
audience
or
Vouchsaf
d
to
think
he
had
partners
You
shall
find
there
A
man
who
is
the
abstract
of
all
faults
That
all
men
follow
LEPIDUS
I
must
not
think
there
are
Evils
enow
to
darken
all
his
goodness
His
faults
in
him
seem
as
the
spots
of
heaven
More
fiery
by
night
s
blackness
hereditary
Rather
than
purchas
d
what
he
cannot
change
Than
what
he
chooses
CAESAR
You
are
too
indulgent
Let
s
grant
it
is
not
Amiss
to
tumble
on
the
bed
of
Ptolemy
To
give
a
kingdom
for
a
mirth
to
sit
And
keep
the
turn
of
tippling
with
a
slave
To
reel
the
streets
at
noon
and
stand
the
buffet
With
knaves
that
smell
of
sweat
Say
this
becomes
him
