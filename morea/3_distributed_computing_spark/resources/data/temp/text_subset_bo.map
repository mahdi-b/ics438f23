true
PISANIO
Sir
as
I
think
CLOTEN
It
is
Posthumus
hand
I
know
t
Sirrah
if
thou
wouldst
not
be
a
villain
but
do
me
true
service
undergo
those
employments
wherein
I
should
have
cause
to
use
thee
with
a
serious
industry
that
is
what
villainy
soe
er
I
bid
thee
do
to
perform
it
directly
and
truly
I
would
think
thee
an
honest
man
thou
shouldst
neither
want
my
means
for
thy
relief
nor
my
voice
for
thy
preferment
PISANIO
Well
my
good
lord
CLOTEN
Wilt
thou
serve
me
For
since
patiently
and
constantly
thou
hast
stuck
to
the
bare
fortune
of
that
beggar
Posthumus
thou
canst
not
in
the
course
of
gratitude
but
be
a
diligent
follower
of
mine
Wilt
thou
serve
me
PISANIO
Sir
I

CLOTEN
Give

thy

wore

The

Let
it

my

Exit
CLOTEN
Meet
thee
at
Milford
Haven
I
forgot
to
ask
him
one
thing
I
ll
remember
t
anon
Even
there
thou
villain
Posthumus
will
I
kill
thee
I
would
these
garments
were
come
She
said
upon
a
time
the
bitterness
of
it
I
now
belch
from
my
heart
that
she
held
the
very
garment
of
Posthumus
in
more
respect
than
my
noble
and
natural
person
together
with
the
adornment
of
my
qualities
With
that
suit
upon
my
back
will
I
ravish
her
first
kill
him
and
in
her
eyes
There
shall
she
see
my
valour
which
will
then
be
a
torment
to
her
contempt
He
on
the
ground
my
speech
of
insultment
ended
on
his
dead
body
and
when
my
lust
hath
dined
which
as
I
say
to
vex
her
I
will
execute
in
the
clothes
that
she
so
prais
d
to
the
court
I
ll
knock
her
back
foot
her
home
again
She
hath
despis
d
me
rejoicingly
and
I
ll
be
merry
in
my
revenge
Re

the
clothes
Be
those

garments

How

CLOTEN
Bring
this
apparel
to
my
chamber
that

the
second

I

commanded
thee
The
third
is
that
thou
wilt
be
a
voluntary
mute
to
my
design
Be
but
duteous
and
true
preferment
shall
tender
itself
to
thee
My
revenge

Come

Why
should
his

not

fit
too
The
rather
saving
reverence
of

a
woman
s
fitness
comes
by
fits
Therein
I
must
play
the
workman
I
dare
speak
it
to
myself
for
it
is
not
vain
glory
for
a
man
and
his
glass
to
confer
in
his
own
chamber
I
mean
the
lines
of
my
body
are
as
well
drawn

his
no

loves
him

What
mortality
is
Posthumus
thy
head
which
now

shall
within

thy

all
this
done
spurn
her
home
to
her

who
may
haply
be
a
little
angry

my
so
rough
usage

My

Out

To
IMOGEN
Brother
stay
here
Are
we
not
brothers
IMOGEN
So
man
and
man
should
be
But
clay
and
clay
differs
in
dignity
Whose
dust
is
both
alike
I
am
very
sick
GUIDERIUS
Go
you
to
hunting
I
ll
abide
with
him
IMOGEN
So
sick
I
am
not
yet
I
am
not
well
But
not
so
citizen
a
wanton
as
To
seem
to
die
ere
sick
So
please
you
leave
me
Stick
to
your
journal
course
The
breach
of
custom
Is
breach
of
all
I
am
ill
but
your
being
by
me
Cannot
amend
me
society
is
no
comfort
To
one
not
sociable
I
am
not
very
sick
Since
I
can
reason
of
it
Pray
you
trust
me
here
I
ll
rob
none
but
myself
and
let
me
die
Stealing
so
poorly
GUIDERIUS
I
love
thee
I
have
spoke
it
How
much
the
quantity
the
weight
as
much
As
I
do
love
my
father
BELARIUS
What
how
how
ARVIRAGUS
If
it
be
sin
to
say
so
sir
I
yoke
me
In
my
good
brother
s
fault
I
know
not
why
I
love
this
youth
and
I
have
heard
you
say
Love

reason
s
without
reason
The
bier
at
door
And
a
demand
who
is
t
shall
die
I

say
My
father
not
this
youth
BELARIUS
Aside
O
noble
strain
O
worthiness
of
nature
breed
of
greatness
Cowards
father
cowards
and
base
things
sire
base
Nature
hath
meal
and
bran
contempt
and
grace
I
m
not
their
father

who
this
should
be
Doth
miracle

Tis
the
ninth
hour
o
th
morn
ARVIRAGUS
Brother
farewell
IMOGEN
I
wish
ye
sport
ARVIRAGUS
Your
health
To
BELARIUS
So
please
you
sir
IMOGEN
Aside
These
are
kind
creatures
Gods
what
lies
I
have
heard
Our
courtiers
say
all
s
savage
but
at
court
Experience
O
thou
disprov
st
report
Th
imperious
seas
breed
monsters
for
the
dish
Poor
tributary
rivers
as
sweet
fish
I
am
sick
still
heart
sick
Pisanio
I
ll
now
taste
of
thy
drug
Swallows
some
GUIDERIUS
I
could
not
stir
him
He
said
he
was
gentle
but
unfortunate
Dishonestly
afflicted
but
yet
honest
ARVIRAGUS
Thus
did
he
answer
me
yet
said
hereafter
I
might
know
more
BELARIUS
To
th
field
to
th
field
We
ll
leave
you
for
this
time
Go
in
and
rest
ARVIRAGUS
We
ll
not
be
long
away
BELARIUS
Pray
be
not
sick
For
you
must
be
our
huswife
IMOGEN
Well
or
ill
I
am
bound
to
you
BELARIUS
And
shalt
be
ever
Exit
IMOGEN
into
the
cave
This
youth
howe
er
distress
d
appears
he
hath
had
Good
ancestors
ARVIRAGUS
How
angel
like
he
sings
GUIDERIUS
But
his
neat
cookery
He
cut
our
roots
in
characters
And
sauc
d
our
broths
as
Juno
had
been
sick
And
he
her
dieter
ARVIRAGUS
Nobly
he
yokes
A
smiling
with
a
sigh
as
if
the
sigh
Was
that
it
was
for
not
being
such
a
smile
The
smile
mocking
the
sigh
that
it
would
fly
From
so
divine
a
temple
to
commix
With
winds
that
sailors
rail
at
GUIDERIUS
I
do
note
That
grief
and
patience
rooted
in
him
both
Mingle
their
spurs
together
ARVIRAGUS
Grow
patience
And
let
the
stinking
elder
grief
untwine
His
perishing
root
with
the
increasing
vine
BELARIUS
It
is
great
morning
Come
away
Who
s
there
Enter
CLOTEN
CLOTEN
I
cannot
find
those
runagates
that
villain
Hath
mock
d
me
I
am
faint
BELARIUS
Those
runagates
Means
he
not
us
I
partly
know
him
tis
Cloten
the
son
o
th
Queen
I
fear
some
ambush
I
saw
him
not
these
many
years
and
yet
I
know
tis
he
We
are
held
as
outlaws
Hence
GUIDERIUS
He
is
but
one
you
and
my
brother
search
What
companies
are
near
Pray
you
away
Let
me
alone
with
him
Exeunt
BELARIUS
and
ARVIRAGUS
CLOTEN
Soft
What
are
you
That
fly
me
thus
Some
villain
mountaineers
I
have
heard
of
such
What
slave
art
thou
GUIDERIUS
A
thing
More
slavish
did
I
ne
er
than
answering
A
slave
without
a
knock
CLOTEN
Thou
art
a
robber
A
law
breaker
a
villain
Yield
thee
thief
GUIDERIUS
To
who
To
thee
What
art
thou
Have
not
I
An
arm
as
big
as
thine
a
heart
as
big
Thy
words
I
grant
are
bigger
for
I
wear
not
My
dagger
in
my
mouth
Say
what
thou
art
Why
I
should
yield
to
thee
CLOTEN
Thou
villain
base
Know
st
me
not
by
my
clothes
GUIDERIUS
No
nor
thy
tailor
rascal
Who
is
thy
grandfather
he
made
those
clothes
Which
as
it
seems
make
thee
CLOTEN
Thou
precious
varlet
My
tailor
made
them
not
GUIDERIUS
Hence
then
and
thank
The
man
that
gave
them
thee
Thou
art
some
fool
I
am
loath
to
beat
thee
CLOTEN
Thou
injurious
thief
Hear
but
my
name
and
tremble
GUIDERIUS
What
s
thy
name
CLOTEN
Cloten
thou
villain
GUIDERIUS
Cloten
thou
double
villain
be
thy
name
I
cannot
tremble
at
it
Were
it
toad
or
adder
spider
Twould
move
me
sooner
CLOTEN
To
thy
further
fear
Nay
to
thy
mere
confusion
thou
shalt
know
I
am
son
to
th
Queen
GUIDERIUS
I
m
sorry
for
t
not
seeming
So
worthy
as
thy
birth
CLOTEN
Art
not
afeard
GUIDERIUS
Those
that
I
reverence
those
I
fear
the
wise
At
fools
I
laugh
not
fear
them
CLOTEN
Die
the
death
When
I
have
slain
thee
with
my
proper
hand
I
ll
follow
those
that
even
now
fled
hence
And
on
the
gates
of
Lud
s
Town
set
your
heads
Yield
rustic
mountaineer
Exeunt
fighting
Re
enter
BELARIUS
and
ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS
No
company
s
abroad
ARVIRAGUS
None
in
the
world
you
did
mistake
him
sure
BELARIUS
I
cannot
tell
long
is
it
since
I
saw
him
But
time
hath
nothing
blurr
d
those
lines
of
favour
Which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
And
burst
of
speaking
were
as
his
I
am
absolute
Twas
very
Cloten
ARVIRAGUS
In
this
place
we
left
them
I
wish
my
brother
make
good
time
with
him
You
say
he
is
so
fell
BELARIUS
Being
scarce
made
up
I
mean
to
man
he
had
not
apprehension
Or
roaring
terrors
for
defect
of
judgment
Is
oft
the
cease
of
fear
Re
enter
GUIDERIUS
with
CLOTEN
S
head
But
see
thy
brother
GUIDERIUS
This
Cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
There
was
no
money
in
t
Not
Hercules
Could
have
knock
d
out
his
brains
for
he
had
none
Yet
I
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
My
head
as
I
do
his
BELARIUS
What
hast
thou
done
GUIDERIUS
I
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
Cloten
s
head
Son
to
the
Queen
after
his
own
report
Who
call
d
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
With
his
own
single
hand
he
d
take
us
in
Displace
our
heads
where
thank
the
gods
they
grow
And
set
them
on
Lud
s
Town
BELARIUS
We
are
all
undone
GUIDERIUS
Why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
But
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
The
law
Protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
To
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
Play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
For
we
do
fear
the
law
What
company
Discover
you
abroad
BELARIUS
No
single
soul
Can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
an
safe
reason
He
must
have
some
attendants
Though
his
humour
Was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
From
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
Absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
rav
d
To
bring
him
here
alone
Although
perhaps
It
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
Cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
