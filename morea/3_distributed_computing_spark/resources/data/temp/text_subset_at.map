Charles
the
Duke
s
wrestler
here
to
speak
with
me
DENNIS
So
please
you
he
is
here
at
the
door
and
importunes
access
to
you
OLIVER
Call
him
in
Exit
DENNIS
Twill
be
a
good
way
and
to
morrow
the
wrestling
is
Enter
CHARLES
CHARLES
Good
morrow
to
your
worship
OLIVER
Good
Monsieur
Charles
What
s
the
new
news
at
the
new
court
CHARLES
There
s
no
news
at
the
court
sir
but
the
old
news
that
is
the
old
Duke
is
banished
by
his
younger
brother
the
new
Duke
and
three
or
four
loving
lords
have
put
themselves
into
voluntary
exile
with
him
whose
lands
and
revenues
enrich
the
new
Duke
therefore
he
gives
them
good
leave
to
wander
OLIVER
Can
you
tell
if
Rosalind
the
Duke
s
daughter
be
banished
with
her
father
CHARLES
O
no
for
the
Duke
s
daughter
her
cousin
so
loves
her
being
ever
from
their
cradles
bred
together
that
she
would
have
followed
her
exile
or
have
died
to
stay
behind
her
She
is
at
the
court
and
no
less
beloved
of
her
uncle
than
his
own
daughter
and
never
two
ladies
loved
as
they
do
OLIVER
Where
will
the
old
Duke
live
CHARLES
They
say
he
is
already
in
the
Forest
of
Arden
and
a
many
merry
men
with
him
and
there
they
live
like
the
old
Robin
Hood
of
England
They
say
many
young
gentlemen
flock
to
him
every
day
and
fleet
the
time
carelessly
as
they
did
in
the
golden
world
OLIVER
What
you
wrestle
to
morrow
before
the
new
Duke
CHARLES
Marry
do
I
sir
and
I
came
to
acquaint
you
with
a
matter
I
am
given
sir
secretly
to
understand
that
your
younger
brother
Orlando
hath
a
disposition
to
come
in
disguis
d
against
me
to
try
a
fall
To
morrow
sir
I
wrestle
for
my
credit
and
he
that
escapes
me
without
some
broken
limb
shall
acquit
him
well
Your
brother
is
but
young
and
tender
and
for
your
love
I
would
be
loath
to
foil
him
as
I
must
for
my
own
honour
if
he
come
in
therefore
out
of
my
love
to
you
I
came
hither
to
acquaint
you
withal
that
either
you
might
stay
him
from
his
intendment
or
brook
such
disgrace
well
as
he
shall
run
into
in
that
it
is
thing
of
his
own
search
and
altogether
against
my
will
OLIVER
Charles
I
thank
thee
for
thy
love
to
me
which
thou
shalt
find
I
will
most
kindly
requite
I
had
myself
notice
of
my
brother
s
purpose
herein
and
have
by
underhand
means
laboured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
is
resolute
I
ll
tell
thee
Charles
it
is
the
stubbornest
young
fellow
of
France
full
of
ambition
an
envious
emulator
of
every
man
s
good
parts
a
secret
and
villainous
contriver
against
me
his
natural
brother
Therefore
use
thy
discretion
I
had
as
lief
thou
didst
break
his
neck
as
his
finger
And
thou
wert
best
look
to
t
for
if
thou
dost
him
any
slight
disgrace
or
if
he
do
not
mightily
grace
himself
on
thee
he
will
practise
against
thee
by
poison
entrap
thee
by
some
treacherous
device
and
never
leave
thee
till
he
hath
ta
en
thy
life
by
some
indirect
means
or
other
for
I
assure
thee
and
almost
with
tears
I
speak
it
there
is
not
one
so
young
and
so
villainous
this
day
living
I
speak
but
brotherly
of
him
but
should
I
anatomize
him
to
thee
as
he
is
I
must
blush
and
weep
and
thou
must
look
pale
and
wonder
CHARLES
I
am
heartily
glad
I
came
hither
to
you
If
he
come
to
morrow
I
ll
give
him
his
payment
If
ever
he
go
alone
again
I
ll
never
wrestle
for
prize
more
And
so
God
keep
your
worship
Exit
OLIVER
Farewell
good
Charles
Now
will
I
stir
this
gamester
I
hope
I
shall
see
an
end
of
him
for
my
soul
yet
I
know
not
why
hates
nothing
more
than
he
Yet
he
s
gentle
never
school
d
and
yet
learned
full
of
noble
device
of
all
sorts
enchantingly
beloved
and
indeed
so
much
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
especially
of
my
own
people
who
best
know
him
that
I
am
altogether
misprised
But
it
shall
not
be
so
long
this
wrestler
shall
clear
all
Nothing
remains
but
that
I
kindle
the
boy
thither
which
now
I
ll
go
about

SCENE
II
A
lawn
before
the
DUKE
S
palace
Enter
ROSALIND
and
CELIA
CELIA
I
pray
thee
Rosalind
sweet
my
coz
be
merry
ROSALIND
Dear
Celia
I
show
more
mirth
than
I
am
mistress
of
and
would
you
yet
I
were
merrier
Unless
you
could
teach
me
to
forget
a
banished
father
you
must
not
learn
me
how
to
remember
any
extraordinary
pleasure
CELIA
Herein
I
see
thou
lov
st
me
not
with
the
full
weight
that
I
love
thee
If
my
uncle
thy
banished
father
had
banished
thy
uncle
the
Duke
my
father
so
thou
hadst
been
still
with
me
I
could
have
taught
my
love
to
take
thy
father
for
mine
so
wouldst
thou
if
the
truth
of
thy
love
to
me
were
so
righteously
temper
d
as
mine
is
to
thee
ROSALIND
Well
I
will
forget
the
condition
of
my
estate
to
rejoice
in
yours
CELIA
You
know
my
father
hath
no
child
but
I
nor
none
is
like
to
have
and
truly
when
he
dies
thou
shalt
be
his
heir
for
what
he
hath
taken
away
from
thy
father
perforce
I
will
render
thee
again
in
affection
By
mine
honour
I
will
and
when
I
break
that
oath
let
me
turn
monster
therefore
my
sweet
Rose
my
dear
Rose
be
merry
ROSALIND
From
henceforth
I
will
coz
and
devise
sports
Let
me
see
what
think
you
of
falling
in
love
CELIA
Marry
I
prithee
do
to
make
sport
withal
but
love
no
man
in
good
earnest
nor
no
further
in
sport
neither
than
with
safety
of
a
pure
blush
thou
mayst
in
honour
come
off
again
ROSALIND
What
shall
be
our
sport
then
CELIA
Let
us
sit
and
mock
the
good
housewife
Fortune
from
her
wheel
that
her
gifts
may
henceforth
be
bestowed
equally
ROSALIND
I
would
we
could
do
so
for
her
benefits
are
mightily
misplaced
and
the
bountiful
blind
woman
doth
most
mistake
in
her
gifts
to
women
CELIA
Tis
true
for
those
that
she
makes
fair
she
scarce
makes
honest
and
those
that
she
makes
honest
she
makes
very
ill
favouredly
ROSALIND
Nay
now
thou
goest
from
Fortune
s
office
to
Nature
s
Fortune
reigns
in
gifts
of
the
world
not
in
the
lineaments
of
Nature
Enter
TOUCHSTONE
CELIA
No
when
Nature
hath
made
a
fair
creature
may
she
not
by
Fortune
fall
into
the
fire
Though
Nature
hath
given
us
wit
to
flout
at
Fortune
hath
not
Fortune
sent
in
this
fool
to
cut
off
the
argument
ROSALIND
Indeed
there
is
Fortune
too
hard
for
Nature
when
Fortune
makes
Nature
s
natural
the
cutter
off
of
Nature
s
wit
CELIA
Peradventure
this
is
not
Fortune
s
work
neither
but
Nature
s
who
perceiveth
our
natural
wits
too
dull
to
reason
of
such
goddesses
and
hath
sent
this
natural
for
our
whetstone
for
always
the
dullness
of
the
fool
is
the
whetstone
of
the
wits
How
now
wit
Whither
wander
you
TOUCHSTONE
Mistress
you
must
come
away
to
your
father
CELIA
Were
you
made
the
messenger
TOUCHSTONE
No
by
mine
honour
but
I
was
bid
to
come
for
you
ROSALIND
Where
learned
you
that
oath
fool
TOUCHSTONE
Of
a
certain
knight
that
swore
by
his
honour
they
were
good
pancakes
and
swore
by
his
honour
the
mustard
was
naught
Now
I
ll
stand
to
it
the
pancakes
were
naught
and
the
mustard
was
good
and
yet
was
not
the
knight
forsworn
CELIA
How
prove
you
that
in
the
great
heap
of
your
knowledge
ROSALIND
Ay
marry
now
unmuzzle
your
wisdom
TOUCHSTONE
Stand
you
both
forth
now
stroke
your
chins
and
swear
by
your
beards
that
I
am
a
knave
CELIA
By
our
beards
if
we
had
them
thou
art
TOUCHSTONE
By
my
knavery
if
I
had
it
then
I
were
But
if
you
swear
by
that
that
not
you
are
not
forsworn
no
more
was
this
knight
swearing
by
his
honour
for
he
never
had
any
or
if
he
had
he
had
sworn
it
away
before
ever
he
saw
those
pancackes
or
that
mustard
CELIA
Prithee
who
is
t
that
thou
mean
st
TOUCHSTONE
One
that
old
Frederick
your
father
loves
CELIA
My
father
s
love
is
enough
to
honour
him
Enough
speak
no
more
of
him
you
ll
be
whipt
for
taxation
one
of
these
days
TOUCHSTONE
The
more
pity
that
fools
may
not
speak
wisely
what
wise
men
do
foolishly
CELIA
By
my
troth
thou
sayest
true
for
since
the
little
wit
that
fools
have
was
silenced
the
little
foolery
that
wise
men
have
makes
a
great
show
Here
comes
Monsieur
Le
Beau
Enter
LE
BEAU
ROSALIND
With
his
mouth
full
of
news
CELIA
Which
he
will
put
on
us
as
pigeons
feed
their
young
ROSALIND
Then
shall
we
be
news
cramm
d
CELIA
All
the
better
we
shall
be
the
more
marketable
Bon
jour
Monsieur
Le
Beau
What
s
the
news
LE
BEAU
Fair
Princess
you
have
lost
much
good
sport
CELIA
Sport
of
what
colour
LE
BEAU
What
colour
madam
How
shall
I
answer
you
ROSALIND
As
wit
and
fortune
will
TOUCHSTONE
Or
as
the
Destinies
decrees
CELIA
Well
said
that
was
laid
on
with
a
trowel
TOUCHSTONE
Nay
if
I
keep
not
my
rank
ROSALIND
Thou
losest
thy
old
smell
LE
BEAU
You
amaze
me
ladies
I
would
have
told
you
of
good
wrestling
which
you
have
lost
the
sight
of
ROSALIND
Yet
tell
us
the
manner
of
the
wrestling
LE
BEAU
I
will
tell
you
the
beginning
and
if
it
please
your
ladyships
you
may
see
the
end
for
the
best
is
yet
to
do
and
here
where
you
are
they
are
coming
to
perform
it
CELIA
Well
the
beginning
that
is
dead
and
buried
LE
BEAU
There
comes
an
old
man
and
his
three
sons
CELIA
I
could
match
this
beginning
with
an
old
tale
LE
BEAU
Three
proper
young
men
of
excellent
growth
and
presence
ROSALIND
With
bills
on
their
necks
Be
it
known
unto
all
men
by
these
presents
LE
BEAU
The
eldest
of
the
three
wrestled
with
Charles
the
Duke
s
wrestler
which
Charles
in
a
moment
threw
him
and
broke
three
of
his
ribs
that
there
is
little
hope
of
life
in
him
So
he
serv
d
the
second
and
so
the
third
Yonder
they
lie
the
poor
old
man
their
father
making
such
pitiful
dole
over
them
that
all
the
beholders
take
his
part
with
weeping
ROSALIND
Alas
TOUCHSTONE
But
what
is
the
sport
monsieur
that
the
ladies
have
lost
LE
BEAU
Why
this
that
I
speak
of
TOUCHSTONE
Thus
men
may
grow
wiser
every
day
It
is
the
first
time
that
ever
I
heard
breaking
of
ribs
was
sport
for
ladies
CELIA
Or
I
I
promise
thee
ROSALIND
But
is
there
any
else
longs
to
see
this
broken
music
in
his
sides
Is
there
yet
another
dotes
upon
rib
breaking
Shall
we
see
this
wrestling
cousin
LE
BEAU
You
must
if
you
stay
here
for
here
is
the
place
appointed
for
the
wrestling
and
they
are
ready
to
perform
it
CELIA
Yonder
sure
they
are
coming
Let
us
now
stay
and
see
it
Flourish
Enter
DUKE
FREDERICK
LORDS
ORLANDO
CHARLES
and
ATTENDANTS
FREDERICK
Come
on
since
the
youth
will
not
be
entreated
his
own
peril
on
his
forwardness
ROSALIND
Is
yonder
the
man
LE
BEAU
Even
he
madam
CELIA
Alas
he
is
too
young
yet
he
looks
successfully
FREDERICK
How
now
daughter
and
cousin
Are
you
crept
hither
to
see
the
wrestling
ROSALIND
Ay
my
liege
so
please
you
give
us
leave
FREDERICK
You
will
take
little
delight
in
it
I
can
tell
you
there
is
such
odds
in
the
man
In
pity
of
the
challenger
s
youth
I
would
fain
dissuade
him
but
he
will
not
be
entreated
Speak
to
him
ladies
see
if
you
can
move
him
CELIA
Call
him
hither
good
Monsieur
Le
Beau

for
you
ORLANDO
I
attend

all
respect
and
duty
ROSALIND
Young
man
have
you
challeng
d
Charles
the
wrestler
ORLANDO
No
fair
Princess
he
is
the
general
challenger
I
come
but
in
as
others
do
to
try
with
him
the
strength
of
my
youth
CELIA
Young
gentleman
your
spirits
are
too
bold
for
your
years
You
have
seen
cruel
proof
of
this
man
s
strength
if
you
saw
yourself
with
your
eyes
or
knew
yourself
with
your
judgment
the
fear
of
your
adventure
would
counsel
you
to
a
more
equal
enterprise
We
pray
you
for
your
own
sake
to
embrace
your
own
safety
and
give
over
this
attempt
ROSALIND
Do
young
sir
your
reputation
shall
not
therefore
be
misprised
we
will
make
it
our
suit
to
the
Duke
that
the
wrestling
might
not
go
forward
ORLANDO
I
beseech
you
punish
me
not
with
your
hard
thoughts
wherein
I
confess
me
much
guilty
to
deny
so
fair
and
excellent
ladies
any
thing
But
let
your
fair
eyes
and
gentle
wishes
go
with
me
to
my
trial
wherein
if
I
be
foil
d
there
is
but
one
sham
d
that
was
never
gracious
if
kill
d
but
one
dead
that
is
willing
to
be
so
I
shall
do
my
friends
no
wrong
for
I
have
none
to
lament
me
the
world
no
injury
for
in
it
I
have
nothing
only
in
the
world
I
fill
up
a
place
which
may
be
better
supplied
when
I
have
made
it
empty
ROSALIND
The
little
strength
that
I
have
I
would
it
were
with
you
CELIA
And
mine
to
eke
out
hers
ROSALIND
Fare
you
well
Pray
heaven
I
be
deceiv
d
in
you

Your
heart

Come
where

this
young
gallant
that
is
so
desirous
to
lie

his
mother
earth
ORLANDO
Ready
sir
but
his
will
hath
in
it
a
more
modest
working
FREDERICK
You
shall
try
but
one
fall
CHARLES
No
I
warrant
your
Grace
you
shall
not
entreat
him
to
a
second
that
have
so
mightily
persuaded
him
from
a
first
ORLANDO
You
mean
to
mock
me
after
you

not
have
mock

before
but
come

ways
ROSALIND
Now

Hadst

But

Exeunt

LE
BEAU
CELIA
Were
I

father
coz
would
I
do
this
ORLANDO
I
am
more
proud
to
be
Sir
Rowland
s
son
His
youngest
son
and
would
not
change
that
calling
To
be
adopted
heir
to
Frederick
ROSALIND
My
father
lov
d
Sir
Rowland
as
his
soul
And
all
the
world
was
of
my
father
s
mind
Had
I
before
known
this
young
man
his
son
I
should
have
given
him
tears
unto
entreaties
Ere
he
should
thus
have
ventur
d
CELIA
Gentle
cousin
Let
us
go
thank
him
and
encourage
him
My
father
s
rough
and
envious
disposition
Sticks
me
at
heart
Sir
you
have
well
deserv
d
If
you
do
keep
your
promises
in
love
But
justly
as
you
have
exceeded
all
promise
Your
mistress
shall
be
happy
ROSALIND
Gentleman
Giving
him
a
chain
from
her
neck
Wear
this
for
me
one
out
of
suits
with
fortune
That
could
give
more
but
that
her
hand
lacks
means
Shall
we
go
coz
CELIA
Ay
Fare
you
well
fair
gentleman
ORLANDO
Can
I
not
say
I
thank
you
My
better
parts
Are
all
thrown
down
and
that
which
here
stands
up
Is
but
a
quintain
a
mere
lifeless
block
ROSALIND
He
calls
us
back
My
pride
fell
with
my
fortunes
I
ll
ask
him
what
he
would
Did
you
call
sir
Sir
you
have
wrestled
well
and
overthrown
More
than
your
enemies
CELIA
Will
you
go
coz
ROSALIND
Have
with
you
Fare
you
well
Exeunt
ROSALIND
and
CELIA
ORLANDO
What
passion
hangs
these
weights
upon
my
tongue
I
cannot
speak
to
her
yet
she
urg
d
conference
O
poor
Orlando
thou
art
overthrown
Or
Charles
or
something
weaker
masters
thee
Re
enter
LE
BEAU
LE
BEAU
Good
sir
I
do
in
friendship
counsel
you
To
leave
this
place
Albeit
you
have
deserv
d
High
commendation
true
applause
and
love
Yet
such
is
now
the
Duke
s
condition
That
he
misconstrues
all
that
you
have
done
The
Duke
is
humorous
what
he
is
indeed
More
suits
you
to
conceive
than
I
to
speak
of
ORLANDO
I
thank
you
sir
and
pray
you
tell
me
this
Which
of
the
two
was
daughter
of
the
Duke
That
here
was
at
the
wrestling
LE
BEAU
Neither
his
daughter
if
we
judge
by
manners
But
yet
indeed
the
smaller
is
his
daughter
The
other
is
daughter
to
the
banish
d
Duke
And
here
detain
d
by
her
usurping
uncle
To
keep
his
daughter
company
whose
loves
Are
dearer
than
the
natural
bond
of
sisters
But
I
can
tell
you
that
of
late
this
Duke
Hath
ta
en
displeasure
gainst
his
gentle
niece
Grounded
upon
no
other
argument
But
that
the
people
praise
her
for
her
virtues
And
pity
her
for
her
good
father
s
sake
And
on
my
life
his
malice
gainst
the
lady
Will
suddenly
break
forth
Sir
fare
you
well
Hereafter
in
a
better
world
than
this
I
shall
desire
more
love
and
knowledge
of
you
ORLANDO
I
rest
much
bounden
to
you
fare
you
well
Exit
LE
BEAU
Thus
must
I
from
the
smoke
into
the
smother
From
tyrant
Duke
unto
a
tyrant
brother
But
heavenly
Rosalind
Exit
SCENE
III
The
DUKE
s
palace
Enter
CELIA
and
ROSALIND
CELIA
Why
cousin
why
Rosalind
Cupid
have
mercy
Not
a
word
ROSALIND
Not
one
to
throw
at
a
dog
CELIA
No
thy
words
are
too
precious
to
be
cast
away
upon
curs
throw
some
of
them
at
me
come
lame
me
with
reasons
ROSALIND
Then
there
were
two
cousins
laid
up
when
the
one
should
be
lam
d
with
reasons
and
the
other
mad
without
any
CELIA
But
is
all
this
for
your
father
ROSALIND
No
some
of
it
is
for
my
child
s
father
O
how
full
of
briers
is
this
working
day
world
CELIA
They
are
but
burs
cousin
thrown
upon
thee
in
holiday
foolery
if
we
walk
not
in
the
trodden
paths
our
very
petticoats
will
catch
them
ROSALIND
I
could
shake
them
off
my
coat
these
burs
are
in
my
heart
CELIA
Hem
them
away
ROSALIND
I
would
try
if
I
could
cry
hem
and
have
him
CELIA
Come
come
wrestle
with
thy
affections
ROSALIND
O
they
take
the
part
of
a
better
wrestler
than
myself
CELIA
O
a
good
wish
upon
you
You
will
try
in
time
in
despite
of
a
fall
But
turning
these
jests
out
of
service
let
us
talk
in
good
earnest
Is
it
possible
on
such
a
sudden
you
should
fall
into
so
strong
a
liking
with
old
Sir
Rowland
s
youngest
son
ROSALIND
The
Duke
my
father
lov
d
his
father
dearly
CELIA
Doth
it
therefore
ensue
that
you
should
love
his
son
dearly
By
this
kind
of
chase
I
should
hate
him
for
my
father
hated
his
father
dearly
yet
I
hate
not
Orlando
ROSALIND
No
faith
hate
him
not
for
my
sake
CELIA
Why
should
I
not
Doth
he
not
deserve
well
Enter
DUKE
FREDERICK
with
LORDS
ROSALIND
Let
me
love
him
for
that
and
do
you
love
him
because
I
do
Look
here
comes
the
Duke
CELIA
With
his
eyes
full
of
anger
FREDERICK
Mistress
dispatch
you
with
your
safest
haste
And
get
you
from
our
court
ROSALIND
Me
uncle
FREDERICK
You
cousin
Within
these
ten
days
if
that
thou
beest
found
So
near
our
public
court
as
twenty
miles
Thou
diest
for
it
ROSALIND
I
do
beseech
your
Grace
Let
me
the
knowledge
of
my
fault
bear
with
me
If
with
myself
I
hold
intelligence
Or
have
acquaintance
with
mine
own
desires
If
that
I
do
not
dream
or
be
not
frantic
As
I
do
trust
I
am
not
then
dear
uncle
Never
so
much
as
in
a
thought
unborn
Did
I
offend
your
Highness
FREDERICK
Thus
do
all
traitors
If
their
purgation
did
consist
in
words
They
are
as
innocent
as
grace
itself
Let
it
suffice
thee
that
I
trust
thee
not
ROSALIND
Yet
your
mistrust
cannot
make
me
a
traitor
Tell
me
whereon
the
likelihood
depends
FREDERICK
Thou
art
thy
father
s
daughter
there
s
enough
ROSALIND
SO
was
I
when
your
Highness
took
his
dukedom
So
was
I
when
your
Highness
banish
d
him
Treason
is
not
inherited
my
lord
Or
if
we
did
derive
it
from
our
friends
What
s
that
to
me
My
father
was
no
traitor
Then
good
my
liege
mistake
me
not
so
much
To
think
my
poverty
is
treacherous
CELIA
Dear
sovereign
hear
me
speak
FREDERICK
Ay
Celia
we
stay
d
her
for
your
sake
Else
had
she
with
her
father
rang
d
along
CELIA
I
did
not
then
entreat
to
have
her
stay
It
was
your
pleasure
and
your
own
remorse
I
was
too
young
that
time
to
value
her
But
now
I
know
her
If
she
be
a
traitor
Why
so
am
I
we
still
have
slept
together
Rose
at
an
instant
learn
d
play
d
eat
together
And
wheresoe
er
we
went
like
Juno
s
swans
Still
we
went
coupled
and
inseparable
FREDERICK
She
is
too
subtle
for
thee
and
her
smoothness
Her
very
silence
and
her
patience
Speak
to
the
people
and
they
pity
her
Thou
art
a
fool
She
robs
thee
of
thy
name
And
thou
wilt
show
more
bright
and
seem
more
virtuous
When
she
is
gone
Then
open
not
thy
lips
Firm
and
irrevocable
is
my
doom
Which
I
have
pass
d
upon
her
she
is
banish
d
CELIA
Pronounce
that
sentence
then
on
me
my
liege
I
cannot
live
out
of
her
company
FREDERICK
You
are
a
fool
You
niece
provide
yourself
If
you
outstay
the
time
upon
mine
honour
And
in
the
greatness
of
my
word
you
die
Exeunt
DUKE
and
LORDS
CELIA
O
my
poor
Rosalind
Whither
wilt
thou
go
Wilt
thou
change
fathers
I
will
give
thee
mine
I
charge
thee
be
not
thou
more
griev
d
than
I
am
ROSALIND
I
have
more
cause
CELIA
Thou
hast
not
cousin
Prithee
be
cheerful
Know
st
thou
not
the
Duke
Hath
banish
d
me
his
daughter
ROSALIND
That
he
hath
not
CELIA
No
hath
not
Rosalind
lacks
then
the
love
Which
teacheth
thee
that
thou
and
I
am
one
Shall
we
be
sund
red
Shall
we
part
sweet
girl
No
let
my
father
seek
another
heir
Therefore
devise
with
me
how
we
may
fly
Whither
to
go
and
what
to
bear
with
us
And
do
not
seek
to
take
your
charge
upon
you
To
bear
your
griefs
yourself
and
leave
me
out
For
by
this
heaven
now
at
our
sorrows
pale
Say
what
thou
canst
I
ll
go
along
with
thee
ROSALIND
Why
whither
shall
we
go
CELIA
To
seek
my
uncle
in
the
Forest
of
Arden
ROSALIND
Alas
what
danger
will
it
be
to
us
Maids
as
we
are
to
travel
forth
so
far
Beauty
provoketh
thieves
sooner
than
gold
CELIA
I
ll
put
myself
in
poor
and
mean
attire
And
with
a
kind
of
umber
smirch
my
face
The
like
do
you
so
shall
we
pass
along
And
never
stir
assailants
ROSALIND
Were
it
not
better
Because
that
I
am
more
than
common
tall
That
I
did
suit
me
all
points
like
a
man
A
gallant
curtle
axe
upon
my
thigh
A
boar
spear
in
my
hand
and
in
my
heart
Lie
there
what
hidden
woman
s
fear
there
will
We
ll
have
a
swashing
and
a
martial
outside
As
many
other
mannish
cowards
have
That
do
outface
it
with
their
semblances
CELIA
What
shall
I
call
thee
when
thou
art
a
man
ROSALIND
I
ll
have
no
worse
a
name
than
Jove
s
own
page
And
therefore
look
you
call
me
Ganymede
But
what
will
you
be
call
d
CELIA
Something
that
hath
a
reference
to
my
state
No
longer
Celia
but
Aliena
ROSALIND
But
cousin
what
if
we
assay
d
to
steal
The
clownish
fool
out
of
your
father
s
court
Would
he
not
be
a
comfort
to
our
travel
CELIA
He
ll
go
along
o
er
the
wide
world
with
me
Leave
me
alone
to
woo
him
Let
s
away
And
get
our
jewels
and
our
wealth
together
Devise
the
fittest
time
and
safest
way
To
hide
us
from
pursuit
that
will
be
made
After
my
flight
Now
go
we
in
content
To
liberty
and
not
to
banishment

I
The

Enter
DUKE
SENIOR
AMIENS
and
two
or
three
LORDS
like
foresters
DUKE
SENIOR
Now
my
co
mates
and
brothers
in
exile
Hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
Than
that
of
painted
pomp
Are
not
these
woods
More
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
Here
feel
we
not
the
penalty
of
Adam
The
seasons
difference
as
the
icy
fang
And
churlish
chiding
of
the
winter
s
wind
