Of
laughter
with
a
sigh
a
note
infallible
Of
breaking
honesty
Horsing
foot
on

Skulking
in
corners
Wishing
clocks
more
swift
Hours
minutes
noon
midnight
And
all
eyes
Blind
with
the
pin
and
web
but
theirs
theirs
only
That

this
nothing
Why
then
the

all
that

The

Bohemia

My

Good

Of

For

dangerous
LEONTES
Say

CAMILLO
No
no
my
lord
LEONTES
It
is
you
lie
you
lie
I
say
thou
liest
Camillo
and
I
hate
thee
Pronounce
thee
a
gross
lout
a
mindless
slave
Or
else
a
hovering
temporizer
that
Canst
with
thine
eyes
at
once
see
good
and
evil
Inclining
to
them
both
Were
my
wife
s
liver
Infected
as
her
life
she
would
not
live
The
running
of
one
glass
CAMILLO
Who
does
her
LEONTES
Why
he
that
wears
her
like
her
medal
hanging
About
his
neck
Bohemia
who
if
I
Had
servants
true
about
me
that
bare
eyes
To
see
alike
mine
honour
as
their
profits
Their
own
particular
thrifts
they
would
do
that
Which
should
undo
more
doing
Ay
and
thou
His
cupbearer
whom
I
from
meaner
form
Have
bench
d
and
rear
d
to
worship
who
mayst
see
Plainly
as
heaven
sees
earth
and
earth
sees
heaven
How
I
am
gall
d
mightst
bespice
a
cup
To
give
mine
enemy
a
lasting
wink
Which
draught
to
me
were
cordial
CAMILLO
Sir
my
lord
I
could
do
this
and
that
with
no
rash
potion
But
with
a
ling
ring
dram
that
should
not
work
Maliciously
like
poison
But
I
cannot
Believe
this
crack
to
be
in
my
dread
mistress
So
sovereignly
being
honourable
I
have
lov
d
thee
LEONTES
Make
that
thy
question
and
go
rot
Dost
think
I
am
so
muddy
so
unsettled
To
appoint
myself
in
this
vexation
sully
The
purity
and
whiteness
of
my
sheets
Which
to
preserve
is
sleep
which
being
spotted
Is
goads
thorns
nettles
tails
of
wasps
Give
scandal
to

o
th
Prince
my
son
Who
I
do

is
mine
and

as
mine
Without

Would

Could

CAMILLO
I
must
believe
you
sir
I
do
and
will
fetch
off
Bohemia
for
t
Provided
that
when
he

remov
d
your
Highness
Will
take
again
your
queen
as
yours
at

Even
for
your

and
thereby
for
sealing
The
injury

Known

LEONTES
Thou

Even
so
as

CAMILLO
My

Go

and

a
countenance
as
clear
As

Bohemia
And
with

cupbearer
If

Account

LEONTES
I

Exit
CAMILLO
O
miserable
lady
But
for
me
What
case
stand
I
in
I
must
be
the
poisoner
Of
good
Polixenes
and
my
ground
to
do
t
Is
the
obedience
to
a
master
one
Who
in
rebellion
with
himself
will
have
All
that
are
his
so
too
To
do
this
deed
Promotion

If
I
could
find
example
Of
thousands
that
had
struck
anointed
kings
And
flourish
d
after
I
d
not
do
t
but
since
Nor
brass
nor

Let

Forsake

To

To

Happy

Here

Methinks
My

Good
day
Camillo
CAMILLO
Hail
most
royal
sir
POLIXENES
What
is
the
news
i
th
court
CAMILLO
None
rare
my
lord
POLIXENES
The
King
hath
on
him
such
a
countenance
As
he
had
lost
some
province
and
a
region
Lov
d
as
he
loves
himself
even
now
I
met
him
With
customary
compliment
when
he
Wafting
his
eyes
to
th
contrary
and
falling
A
lip
of
much
contempt
speeds
from
me
So
leaves
me
to
consider
what
is
breeding
That
changes
thus
his
manners
CAMILLO
I
dare
not
know
my
lord
POLIXENES
How
dare
not
Do
not
Do
you
know
and
dare
not
Be
intelligent
to
me
Tis
thereabouts
For
to
yourself
what
you
do
know
you
must
And
cannot
say
you
dare
not
Good
Camillo
Your
chang
d
complexions
are
to
me
a
mirror
Which
shows
me
mine
chang

too
for
I
must
be
A
party
in
this
alteration
finding
Myself
thus
alter
d
with
t
CAMILLO
There
is
a
sickness
Which
puts
some
of
us
in
distemper
but
I
cannot
name
the
disease
and
it
is
caught
Of
you
that
yet
are
well
POLIXENES
How
caught
of
me
Make
me
not
sighted
like
the
basilisk
I
have
look
d
on
thousands
who
have
sped
the
better
By
my
regard
but
kill
d
none
so
Camillo
As
you
are
certainly
a
gentleman
thereto
Clerk
like
experienc
d
which
no
less
adorns
Our
gentry
than
our
parents
noble
names
In
whose
success
we
are
gentle
I
beseech
you
If
you

aught
which
does
behove

knowledge
Thereof
to

imprison

In

CAMILLO
I
may
not

POLIXENES
A
sickness
caught

me
and
yet
I
well
I
must
be

Dost
thou
hear
Camillo
I
conjure
thee
by
all
the
parts
of
man
Which
honour
does
acknowledge
whereof
the
least
Is
not
this
suit
of
mine
that
thou
declare
What
incidency
thou
dost
guess
of
harm
Is
creeping
toward
me
how
far
off
how
near
Which
way
to
be
prevented

If

how

CAMILLO
Sir
I
will
tell
you
Since
I
am
charg
d
in
honour
and
by
him
That
I
think
honourable
Therefore
mark
my
counsel
Which
must
be
ev

as
swiftly
followed
as
I
mean
to
utter
it
or
both
yourself
and
me
Cry
lost

so
goodnight
POLIXENES
On
good
Camillo
CAMILLO
I
am
appointed
him
to
murder
you
POLIXENES
By
whom
Camillo
CAMILLO
By
the
King
POLIXENES
For
what
CAMILLO
He
thinks
nay
with
all
confidence
he
swears
As
he
had
seen
t
or
been
an
instrument
To
vice
you
to
t
that
you
have
touch
d
his
queen
Forbiddenly
POLIXENES
O
then
my
best
blood
turn
To
an
infected
jelly
and
my
name
Be
yok
d
with
his
that
did
betray
the
Best
Turn
then
my
freshest
reputation
to
A
savour
that
may
strike
the
dullest
nostril
Where
I
arrive
and
my
approach
be
shunn
d
Nay
hated
too
worse
than
the
great
st
infection
That
e
er
was
heard
or
read
CAMILLO
Swear
his
thought
over
By
each
particular
star
in
heaven
and
By
all
their
influences
you
may
as
well
Forbid
the
sea
for
to
obey
the
moon
As
or
by
oath
remove
or
counsel
shake
The
fabric
of
his
folly
whose
foundation
Is
pil
d
upon
his
faith
and
will
continue
The
standing
of
his
body
POLIXENES
How
should
this
grow
CAMILLO
I
know
not
but
I
am
sure
tis
safer
to
Avoid
what
s
grown
than
question
how
tis
born
If
therefore
you
dare
trust
my
honesty
That
lies
enclosed
in
this
trunk
which
you
Shall
bear
along
impawn
d
away
to
night
Your
followers
I
will
whisper
to
the
business
And
will
by
twos
and
threes
at
several
posterns
Clear
them
o
th
city
For
myself
I
ll
put
My
fortunes
to
your
service
which
are
here
By
this
discovery
lost
Be
not
uncertain
For
by
the
honour
of
my
parents
I
Have
utt
red
truth
which
if
you
seek
to
prove
I
dare
not
stand
by
nor
shall
you
be
safer
Than
one
condemn
d
by
the
King
s
own
mouth
thereon
His
execution

POLIXENES
I
do
believe
thee
I
saw

Give

Be

thy

Still

My

My

Two

This
jealousy
Is
for

Must

Must

Behind

Saw

them
Even

LEONTES
How
blest
am
I
In
my
just
censure
in
my
true
opinion
Alack
for
lesser
knowledge
How
accurs
d
In
being
so
blest
There
may
be
in
the
cup
A
spider
steep
d
and
one
may
drink
depart
And
yet
partake
no
venom
for
his
knowledge
Is
not
infected
but
if
one
present
Th
abhorr
d
ingredient
to
his
eye
make
known
How
he
hath
drunk
he
cracks
his
gorge
his
sides
With
violent
hefts
I
have
drunk
and
seen
the
spider
Camillo
was
his
help
in
this
his
pander
There
is
a
plot
against
my
life
my
crown
All
s
true
that
is
mistrusted
That
false
villain
Whom
I
employ
d
was
pre
employ
d
by
him
He
has
discover
d
my
design
and
I
Remain
a
pinch
d
thing
yea
a
very
trick
For
them
to
play
at

How
came
the
posterns
So
easily
open
FIRST
LORD
By
his
great
authority
Which
often
hath
no
less
prevail
d
than
so
On
your
command
LEONTES
I
know
t
too
well
Give
me
the
boy
I
am
glad
you
did
not
nurse
him
Though
he
does
bear
some
signs
of
me
yet
you
Have
too
much
blood
in
him
HERMIONE
What
is
this
Sport
LEONTES
Bear
the
boy
hence
he
shall
not
come
about
her
Away
with
him
and
let
her
sport
herself
MAMILLIUS
is
led
out
With
that
she
s
big
with
for
tis
Polixenes
Has
made
thee
swell
thus
HERMIONE
But
I
d
say
he
had
not
And
I
ll
be
sworn
you
would
believe
my
saying
Howe
er
you
lean
to
th
nayward
LEONTES
You
my
lords
Look
on
her
mark
her
well
be
but
about
To
say
She
is
a
goodly
lady
and
The
justice
of
your
hearts
will
thereto
ad
Tis
pity
she
s
not
honest
honourable
Praise
her
but
for
this
her
without
door
form
Which
on
my
faith
deserves
high
speech
and
straight
The
shrug
the
hum
or
ha
these
petty
brands
That
calumny
doth
use
O
I
am
out
That
mercy
does
for
calumny
will
sear
Virtue
itself
these
shrugs
these
hum
s
and
ha
s
When
you
have
said
she
s
goodly
come
between
Ere
you
can
say
she
s
honest
But
be
t
known
From
him
that
has
most
cause
to
grieve
it
should
be
She
s
an
adultress
HERMIONE
Should
a
villain
say
so
The
most
replenish
d
villain
in
the
world
He
were
as
much
more
villain
you
my
lord
Do
but
mistake
LEONTES
You
have
mistook
my
lady
Polixenes
for
Leontes
O
thou
thing
Which
I
ll
not
call
a
creature
of
thy
place
Lest
barbarism
making
me
the
precedent
Should
a
like
language
use
to
all
degrees
And
mannerly
distinguishment
leave
out
Betwixt
the
prince
and
beggar
I
have
said
She
s
an
adultress
I
have
said
with
whom
More
she
s
a
traitor
and
Camillo
is
A
federary
with
her
and
one
that
knows
What
she
should
shame
to
know
herself
But
with
her
most
vile
principal
that
she
s
A
bed
swerver
even
as
bad
as
those
That
vulgars
give
bold
st
titles
ay
and
privy
To
this
their
late
escape
HERMIONE
No
by
my
life
Privy
to
none
of
this
How
will
this
grieve
you
When
you
shall
come
to
clearer
knowledge
that
You
thus
have
publish
d
me
Gentle
my
lord
You
scarce
can
right
me
throughly
then
to
say
You
did
mistake
LEONTES
No
if
I
mistake
In
those
foundations
which
I
build
upon
The
centre
is
not
big
enough
to
bear
A
school
boy
s
top
Away
with
her
to
prison
He
who
shall
speak
for
her
is
afar
off
guilty
But
that
he
speaks
HERMIONE
There
s
some
ill
planet
reigns
I
must

Good

To

Be

LEONTES
Why
what
need
we
Commune
with
you
of

rather
follow
Our
forceful
instigation
Our
prerogative
Calls
not
your
counsels
but
our
natural
goodness
Imparts
this
which
if
you

stupified
Or
seeming

Relish

The

Properly

I

You

tried

Without

Either

Added

Made

Well

Though

Give
