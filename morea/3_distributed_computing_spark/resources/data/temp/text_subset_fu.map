Pedro

Enter
Don
Pedro
Claudio
Benedick
Balthasar
and
John
the
Bastard
Pedro
Good
Signior
Leonato
are
you
come
to
meet
your
trouble
The
fashion
of
the
world
is
to
avoid
cost
and
you
encounter
it
Leon
Never
came
trouble
to
my
house
in
the
likeness
of
your
Grace
for
trouble
being
gone
comfort
should
remain
but
when
you
depart
from
me
sorrow
abides
and
happiness
takes
his
leave
Pedro
You
embrace
your
charge
too
willingly
I
think
this
is
your
daughter
Leon
Her
mother
hath
many
times
told
me
so
Bene
Were
you
in
doubt
sir
that
you
ask
d
her
Leon
Signior
Benedick
no
for
then
were
you
a
child
Pedro
You
have
it
full
Benedick
We
may
guess
by
this
what
you
are
being
a
man
Truly
the
lady
fathers
herself
Be
happy
lady
for
you
are
like
an
honourable
father
Bene
If
Signior
Leonato
be
her
father
she
would
not
have
his
head
on
her
shoulders
for
all
Messina
as
like
him
as
she
is
Beat
I
wonder
that
you
will
still
be
talking
Signior
Benedick
Nobody
marks
you
Bene
What
my
dear
Lady
Disdain
are
you
yet
living
Beat
Is
it
possible
Disdain
should
die
while
she
hath
such
meet
food
to
feed
it
as
Signior
Benedick
Courtesy
itself
must
convert
to
disdain
if
you
come
in
her
presence
Bene
Then
is
courtesy
a
turncoat
But
it
is
certain
I
am
loved
of
all
ladies
only
you
excepted
and
I
would
I
could
find
in
my
heart
that
I
had
not
a
hard
heart
for
truly
I
love
none
Beat
A
dear
happiness
to
women
They
would
else
have
been
troubled
with
a
pernicious
suitor
I
thank
God
and
my
cold
blood
I
am
of
your
humour
for
that
I
had
rather
hear
my
dog
bark
at
a
crow
than
a
man
swear
he
loves
me
Bene
God
keep
your
ladyship
still
in
that
mind
So
some
gentleman
or
other
shall
scape
a
predestinate
scratch
d
face
Beat
Scratching
could
not
make
it
worse
an
twere
such
a
face
as
yours
were
Bene
Well
you
are
a
rare
parrot
teacher
Beat
A
bird
of
my
tongue
is
better
than
a
beast
of
yours
Bene
I
would
my
horse
had
the
speed
of
your
tongue
and
so
good
a
continuer
But
keep
your
way
a
God
s
name
I
have
done
Beat
You
always
end
with
a
jade
s
trick
I
know
you
of
old
Pedro
That
is
the
sum
of
all
Leonato
Signior
Claudio
and
Signior
Benedick
my
dear
friend
Leonato
hath
invited
you
all
I
tell
him
we
shall
stay
here
at
the
least
a
month
and
he
heartly
prays
some
occasion
may
detain
us
longer
I
dare
swear
he
is
no
hypocrite
but
prays
from
his
heart
Leon
If
you
swear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
forsworn
To
Don
John
Let
me
bid
you
welcome
my
lord
Being
reconciled
to
the
Prince
your
brother
I
owe
you
all
duty
John
I
thank
you
I
am
not
of
many
words
but
I
thank
you
Leon
Please
it
your
Grace
lead
on
Pedro
Your
hand
Leonato
We
will
go
together
Exeunt
Manent
Benedick
and
Claudio
Claud
Benedick
didst
thou
note
the
daughter
of
Signior
Leonato
Bene
I
noted
her
not
but
I
look
d
on
her
Claud
Is
she
not
a
modest
young
lady
Bene
Do
you
question
me
as
an
honest
man
should
do
for
my
simple
true
judgment
or
would
you
have
me
speak
after
my
custom
as
being
a
professed
tyrant
to
their
sex
Claud
No
I
pray
thee
speak
in
sober
judgment
Bene
Why
i
faith
methinks
she
s
too
low
for
a
high
praise
too
brown
for
a
fair
praise
and
too
little
for
a
great
praise
Only
this
commendation
I
can
afford
her
that
were
she
other
than
she
is
she
were
unhandsome
and
being
no
other
but
as
she
is
I
do
not
like
her
Claud
Thou
thinkest
I
am
in
sport
I
pray
thee
tell
me
truly
how
thou
lik
st
her
Bene
Would
you
buy
her
that
you
enquire
after
her
Claud
Can
the
world
buy
such
a
jewel
Bene
Yea
and
a
case
to
put
it
into
But
speak
you
this
with
a
sad
brow
or
do
you
play
the
flouting
Jack
to
tell
us
Cupid
is
a
good
hare
finder
and
Vulcan
a
rare
carpenter
Come
in
what
key
shall
a
man
take
you
to
go
in
the
song
Claud
In
mine
eye
she
is
the
sweetest
lady
that
ever
I
look
d
on
Bene
I
can
see
yet
without
spectacles
and
I
see
no
such
matter
There
s
her
cousin
an
she
were
not
possess
d
with
a
fury
exceeds
her
as
much
in
beauty
as
the
first
of
May
doth
the
last
of
December
But
I
hope
you
have
no
intent
to
turn
husband
have
you
Claud
I
would
scarce
trust
myself
though
I
had
sworn
the
contrary
if
Hero
would
be
my
wife
Bene
Is
t
come
to
this
In
faith
hath
not
the
world
one
man
but
he
will
wear
his
cap
with
suspicion
Shall
I
never
see
a
bachelor
of
threescore
again
Go
to
i
faith
An
thou
wilt
needs
thrust
thy
neck
into
a
yoke
wear
the
print
of
it
and
sigh
away
Sundays
Enter
Don
Pedro
Look
Don
Pedro
is
returned
to
seek
you
Pedro
What
secret
hath
held
you
here
that
you
followed
not
to
Leonato
s
Bene
I
would
your
Grace
would
constrain
me
to
tell
Pedro
I
charge
thee
on
thy
allegiance
Bene
You
hear
Count
Claudio
I
can
be
secret
as
a
dumb
man
I
would
have
you
think
so
but
on
my
allegiance
mark
you
this
on
my
allegiance
he
is
in
love
With
who
Now
that
is
your
Grace
s
part
Mark
how
short
his
answer
is
With
Hero
Leonato
s
short
daughter
Claud
If
this
were
so
so
were
it
utt
red
Bene
Like
the
old
tale
my
lord
It
is
not
so
nor
twas
not
so
but
indeed
God
forbid
it
should
be
so
Claud
If
my
passion
change
not
shortly
God
forbid
it
should
be
otherwise
Pedro
Amen
if
you
love
her
for
the
lady
is
very
well
worthy
Claud
You
speak
this
to
fetch
me
in
my
lord
Pedro
By
my
troth
I
speak
my
thought
Claud
And
in
faith
my
lord
I
spoke
mine
Bene
And
by
my
two
faiths
and
troths
my
lord
I
spoke
mine
Claud
That
I
love
her
I
feel
Pedro
That
she
is
worthy
I
know
Bene
That
I
neither
feel
how
she
should
be
loved
nor
know
how
she
should
be
worthy
is
the
opinion
that
fire
cannot
melt
out
of
me
I
will
die
in
it
at
the
stake
Pedro
Thou
wast
ever
an
obstinate
heretic
in
the
despite
of
beauty
Claud
And
never
could
maintain
his
part
but
in
the
force
of
his
will
Bene
That
a
woman
conceived
me
I
thank
her
that
she
brought
me
up
I
likewise
give
her
most
humble
thanks
but
that
I
will
have
a
rechate
winded
in
my
forehead
or
hang
my
bugle
in
an
invisible
baldrick
all
women
shall
pardon
me
Because
I
will
not
do
them
the
wrong
to
mistrust
any
I
will
do
myself
the
right
to
trust
none
and
the
fine
is
for
the
which
I
may
go
the
finer
I
will
live
a
bachelor
Pedro
I
shall
see
thee
ere
I
die
look
pale
with
love
Bene
With
anger
with
sickness
or
with
hunger
my
lord
not
with
love
Prove
that
ever
I
lose
more
blood
with
love
than
I
will
get
again
with
drinking
pick
out
mine
eyes
with
a
ballad
maker
s
pen
and
hang
me
up
at
the
door
of
a
brothel
house
for
the
sign
of
blind
Cupid
Pedro
Well
if
ever
thou
dost
fall
from
this
faith
thou
wilt
prove
a
notable
argument
Bene
If
I
do
hang
me
in
a
bottle
like
a
cat
and
shoot
at
me
and
he
that
hits
me
let
him
be
clapp
d
on
the
shoulder
and
call
d
Adam
Pedro
Well
as
time
shall
try
In
time
the
savage
bull
doth
bear
the
yoke
Bene
The
savage
bull
may
but
if
ever
the
sensible
Benedick
bear
it
pluck
off
the
bull
s
horns
and
set
them
in
my
forehead
and
let
me
be
vilely
painted
and
in
such
great
letters
as
they
write
Here
is
good
horse
to
hire
let
them
signify
under
my
sign
Here
you
may
see
Benedick
the
married
man
Claud
If
this
should
ever
happen
thou
wouldst
be
horn
mad
Pedro
Nay
if
Cupid
have
not
spent
all
his
quiver
in
Venice
thou
wilt
quake
for
this
shortly
Bene
I
look
for
an
earthquake
too
then
Pedro
Well
you
will
temporize
with
the
hours
In
the
meantime
good
Signior
Benedick
repair
to
Leonato
s
commend
me
to
him
and
tell
him
I
will
not
fail
him
at
supper
for
indeed
he
hath
made
great
preparation
Bene
I
have
almost
matter
enough
in
me
for
such
an
embassage
and
so
I
commit
you
Claud
To
the
tuition
of
God
From
my
house
if
I
had
it
Pedro
The
sixth
of
July
Your
loving
friend
Benedick
Bene
Nay
mock
not
mock
not
The
body
of
your
discourse
is
sometime
guarded
with
fragments
and
the
guards
are
but
slightly
basted
on
neither
Ere
you
flout
old
ends
any
further
examine
your
conscience
And
so
I
leave
you
Exit
Claud
My
liege
your
Highness
now
may
do
me
good
Pedro
My
love
is
thine
to
teach
Teach
it
but
how
And
thou
shalt
see
how
apt
it
is
to
learn
Any
hard
lesson
that
may
do
thee
good
Claud
Hath
Leonato
any
son
my
lord
Pedro
No
child
but
Hero
she
s
his
only
heir
Dost
thou
affect
her
Claudio
Claud
O
my
lord
When
you
went
onward
on
this
ended
action
I
look
d
upon
her
with
a
soldier
s
eye
That
lik
d
but
had
a
rougher
task
in
hand
Than
to
drive
liking
to
the
name
of
love
But
now
I
am
return
d
and
that
war
thoughts
Have
left
their
places
vacant
in
their
rooms
Come
thronging
soft
and
delicate
desires
All
prompting
me
how
fair
young
Hero
is
Saying
I
lik
d
her
ere
I
went
to
wars
Pedro
Thou
wilt
be
like
a
lover
presently
And
tire
the
hearer
with
a
book
of
words
If
thou
dost
love
fair
Hero
cherish
it
And
I
will
break
with
her
and
with
her
father
And
thou
shalt
have
her
Wast
not
to
this
end
That
thou
began
st
to
twist
so
fine
a
story
Claud
How
sweetly
you
do
minister
to
love
That
know
love
s
grief
by
his
complexion
But
lest
my
liking
might
too
sudden
seem
I
would
have
salv
d
it
with
a
longer
treatise
Pedro
What
need
the
bridge
much
broader
than
the
flood
The
fairest
grant
is
the
necessity
Look
what
will
serve
is
fit
Tis
once
thou
lovest
And
I
will
fit
thee
with
the
remedy
I
know
we
shall
have
revelling
to
night
I
will
assume
thy
part
in
some
disguise
And
tell
fair
Hero
I
am
Claudio
And
in
her
bosom
I
ll
unclasp
my
heart
And
take
her
hearing
prisoner
with
the
force
And
strong
encounter
of
my
amorous
tale
Then
after
to
her
father
will
I
break
And
the
conclusion
is
she
shall
be
thine
In
practice
let
us
put
it
presently
Exeunt
Scene
II
A
room
in
Leonato
s
house
Enter
at
one
door
Leonato
and
at
another
door
Antonio
an
old
man
brother
to
Leonato
Leon
How
now
brother
Where
is
my
cousin
your
son
Hath
he
provided
this
music
Ant
He
is
very
busy
about
it
But
brother
I
can
tell
you
strange
news
that
you
yet
dreamt
not
of
Leon
Are
they
good
Ant
As
the
event
stamps
them
but
they
have
a
good
cover
they
show
well
outward
The
Prince
and
Count
Claudio
walking
in
a
thick
pleached
alley
in
mine
orchard
were
thus
much
overheard
by
a
man
of
mine
the
Prince
discovered
to
Claudio
that
he
loved
my
niece
your
daughter
and
meant
to
acknowledge
it
this
night
in
a
dance
and
if
he
found
her
accordant
he
meant
to
take
the
present
time
by
the
top
and
instantly
break
with
you
of
it
Leon
Hath
the
fellow
any
wit
that
told
you
this
Ant
A
good
sharp
fellow
I
will
send
for
him
and
question
him
yourself
Leon
No
no
We
will
hold
it
as
a
dream
till
it
appear
itself
but
I
will
acquaint
my
daughter
withal
that
she
may
be
the
better
prepared
for
an
answer
if
peradventure
this
be
true
Go
you
and
tell
her
of
it
Exit
Antonio
Enter
Antonio
s
Son
with
a
Musician
and
others
To
the
Son
Cousin
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
To
the
Musician
O
I
cry
you
mercy
friend
Go
you
with
me
and
I
will
use
your
skill
Good
cousin
have
a
care
this
busy
time
Exeunt
Scene
III
Another
room
in
Leonato
s
house
Enter
Sir
John
the
Bastard
and
Conrade
his
companion
Con
What
the
goodyear
my
lord
Why
are
you
thus
out
of
measure
sad
John
There
is
no
measure
in
the
occasion
that
breeds
therefore
the
sadness
is
without
limit
Con
You
should
hear
reason
John
And
when
I
have
heard
it
what
blessings
brings
it
Con
If
not
a
present
remedy
at
least
a
patient
sufferance
John
I
wonder
that
thou
being
as
thou
say
st
thou
art
born
under
Saturn
goest
about
to
apply
a
moral
medicine
to
a
mortifying
mischief
I
cannot
hide
what
I
am
I
must
be
sad
when
I
have
cause
and
smile
at
no
man
s
jests
eat
when
I
have
stomach
and
wait
for
no
man
s
leisure
sleep
when
I
am
drowsy
and
tend
on
no
man
s
business
laugh
when
I
am
merry
and
claw
no
man
in
his
humour
Con
Yea
but
you
must
not
make
the
full
show
of
this
till
you
may
do
it
without
controlment
You
have
of
late
stood
out
against
your
brother
and
he
hath
ta
en
you
newly
into
his
grace
where
it
is
impossible
you
should
take
true
root
but
by
the
fair
weather
that
you
make
yourself
It
is
needful
that
you
frame
the
season
for
your
own
harvest
John
I
had
rather
be
a
canker
in
a
hedge
than
a
rose
in
his
grace
and
it
better
fits
my
blood
to
be
disdain
d
of
all
than
to
fashion
a
carriage
to
rob
love
from
any
In
this
though
I
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
flattering
honest
man
it
must
not
be
denied
but
I
am
a
plain
dealing
villain
I
am
trusted
with
a
muzzle
and
enfranchis
d
with
a
clog
therefore
I
have
decreed
not
to
sing
in
my
cage
If
I
had
my
mouth
I
would
bite
if
I
had
my
liberty
I
would
do
my
liking
In
the
meantime
let
me
be
that
I
am
and
seek
not
to
alter
me
Con
Can
you
make
no
use
of
your
discontent
John
I
make
all
use
of
it
for
I
use
it
only
Enter
Borachio

to
build
mischief
on
What

for
a
fool
that
betroths
himself
to
unquietness

II
Scene
I
A
hall
in
Leonato
s
house
Enter
Leonato
Antonio
his
Brother
Hero
his
Daughter
and
Beatrice
his
Niece
and
a
Kinsman
also
Margaret
and
Ursula
Leon
Was
not
Count
John
here
at
supper
Ant
I
saw
him
not
Beat
How
tartly
that
gentleman
looks
I
never
can
see
him
but
I
am
heart
burn
d
an
hour
after
Hero
He
is
of
a
very
melancholy
disposition
Beat
He
were
an
excellent
man
that
were
made
just
in
the
midway
between
him
and
Benedick
The
one
is
too
like
an
image
and
says
nothing
and
the
other
too
like
my
lady
s
eldest
son
evermore
tattling
Leon
Then
half
Signior
Benedick
s
tongue
in
Count
John
s
mouth
and
half
Count
John
s
melancholy
in
Signior
Benedick
s
face
Beat
With
a
good
leg
and
a
good
foot
uncle
and
money
enough
in
his
purse
such
a
man
would
win
any
woman
in
the
world
if
a
could
get
her
good
will
Leon
By
my
troth
niece
thou
wilt
never
get
thee
a
husband
if
thou
be
so
shrewd
of
thy
tongue
Ant
In
faith
she
s
too
curst
Beat
Too
curst
is
more
than
curst
I
shall
lessen
God
s
sending
that
way
for
it
is
said
God
sends
a
curst
cow
short
horns
but
to
a
cow
too
curst
he
sends
none
Leon
So
by
being
too
curst
God
will
send
you
no
horns
Beat
Just
if
he
send
me
no
husband
for
the
which
blessing
I
am
at
him
upon
my
knees
every
morning
and
evening
Lord
I
could
not
endure
a
husband
with
a
beard
on
his
face
I
had
rather
lie
in
the
woollen
Leon
You
may
light
on
a
husband
that
hath
no
beard
Beat
What
should
I
do
with
him
dress
him
in
my
apparel
and
make
him
my
waiting
gentlewoman
He
that
hath
a
beard
is
more
than
a
youth
and
he
that
hath
no
beard
is
less
than
a
man
and
he
that
is
more
than
a
youth
is
not
for
me
and
he
that
is
less
than
a
man
I
am
not
for
him
Therefore
I
will
even
take
sixpence
in
earnest
of
the
berrord
and
lead
his
apes
into
hell
Leon
Well
then
go
you
into
hell
Beat
No
but
to
the
gate
and
there
will
the
devil
meet
me
like
an
old
cuckold
with
horns
on
his
head
and
say
Get
you
to
heaven
Beatrice
get
you
to
heaven
Here
s
no
place
for
you
maids
So
deliver
I
up
my
apes
and
away
to
Saint
Peter
for
the
heavens
He
shows
me
where
the
bachelors
sit
and
there
live
we
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
Ant
to
Hero
Well
niece
I
trust
you
will
be
rul
d
by
your
father
Beat
Yes
faith
It
is
my
cousin
s
duty
to
make
cursy
and
say
Father
as
it
please
you
But
yet
for
all
that
cousin
let
him
be
a
handsome
fellow
or
else
make
another
cursy
and
say
Father
as
it
please
me
Leon
Well
niece
I
hope
to
see
you
one
day
fitted
with
a
husband
Beat
Not
till
God
make
men
of
some
other
metal
than
earth
Would
it
not
grieve
a
woman
to
be
overmaster
d
with
a
piece
of
valiant
dust
to
make
an
account
of
her
life
to
a
clod
of
wayward
marl
No
uncle
I
ll
none
Adam
s
sons
are
my
brethren
and
truly
I
hold
it
a
sin
to
match
in
my
kinred
Leon
Daughter
remember
what
I
told
you
If
the
Prince
do
solicit
you
in
that
kind
you
know
your
answer
Beat
The
fault
will
be
in
the
music
cousin
if
you
be
not
wooed
in
good
time
If
the
Prince
be
too
important
tell
him
there
is
measure
in
everything
and
so
dance
out
the
answer
For
hear
me
Hero
wooing
wedding
and
repenting
is
as
a
Scotch
jig
a
measure
and
a
cinque
pace
the
first
suit
is
hot
and
hasty
like
a
Scotch
jig
and
full
as
fantastical
the
wedding
mannerly
modest
as
a
measure
full
of
state
and
ancientry
and
then
comes
Repentance
and
with
his
bad
legs
falls
into
the
cinque
pace
faster
and
faster
till
he
sink
into
his
grave
Leon
Cousin
you
apprehend
passing
shrewdly
Beat
I
have
a
good
eye

Pedro
Lady
will

walk
a
bout
with
your
friend
Hero
So
you
walk
softly
and
look
sweetly
and

nothing
I
am
yours
for
the
walk
and
especially
when
I
walk
away
Pedro
With
me
in
your
company
Hero
I
may
say
so
when
I
please
Pedro
And
when
please

so
Hero
When
I

My

Speak

Takes

Balth
Well
I
would
you
did
like
me
Marg
So
would
not
I

your
own
sake
for
I
have
many
ill
qualities
Balth
Which
is
one
Marg
I
say
my
prayers
aloud
Balth
I
love

better
The

Amen

Answer
clerk
Balth
No

words
The
clerk
is
answered
Takes
her
aside
Urs
I
know
you
well
enough
You
are
Signior
Antonio
Ant
At
a
word
I
am
not
Urs
I
know
you
by
the
waggling
of
your
head
Ant
To
tell
you
true
I
counterfeit
him
Urs
You
could
never
do
him
so
ill
well
unless
you
were
the
very
man
Here
s
his
dry
hand
up
and
down
You
are
he
you
are
he
Ant
At
a
word
I
am
not
Urs
Come
come
do
you
think
I
do
not
know
you
by
your
excellent
wit
Can
virtue
hide
itself
Go
to
mum
you
are
he
Graces
will
appear
and
there
s
an
end
They
step
aside
Beat
Will
you
not
tell
me
who
told
you
so
Bene
No
you
shall
pardon
me
Beat
Nor
will
you
not
tell
me
who
you
are
Bene
Not
now
Beat
That
I
was
disdainful
and
that
I
had
my
good
wit
out
of
the
Hundred
Merry
Tales
Well
this
was
Signior
Benedick
that
said
so
Bene
What
s
he
Beat
I
am
sure
you
know
him
well
enough
Bene
Not
I
believe
me
Beat
Did
he
never
make
you
laugh
Bene
I
pray
you
what
is
he
Beat
Why
he
is
the
Prince
s
jester
a
very
dull
fool
Only
his
gift
is
in
devising
impossible
slanders
None
but
libertines
delight
in
him
and
the
commendation
is
not
in
his
wit
but
in
his
villany
for
he
both
pleases
men
and
angers
them
and
then
they
laugh
at
him
and
beat
him
I
am
sure
he
is
in
the
fleet
I
would
he
had
boarded
me
Bene
When
I
know
the
gentleman
I
ll
tell
him
what
you
say
Beat
Do
do
He
ll
but
break
a
comparison
or
two
on
me
which
peradventure
not
marked
or
not
laugh
d
at
strikes
him
into
melancholy
and
then
there
s
a
partridge
wing
saved
for
the
fool
will
eat
no
supper
that
night
Music
We
must
follow
the
leaders
Bene
In
every
good
thing
Beat
Nay
if
they
lead
to
any
ill
I
will
leave
them
at
the
next
turning
Dance
Exeunt
all
but
Don
John
Borachio
and
Claudio
John
Sure
my
brother
is
amorous
on
Hero
and
hath
withdrawn
her
father
to
break
with
him
about
it
The
ladies
follow
her
and
but
one
visor
remains
Bora
And
that
is
Claudio
I
know
him
by
his
bearing
John
Are
you
not
Signior
Benedick
Claud
You
know
me
well
I
am
he
John
Signior
you
are
very
near
my
brother
in
his
love
He
is
enamour
d
on
Hero
I
pray
you
dissuade
him
from
her
she
is
no
equal
for
his
birth
You
may
do
the
part
of
an
honest
man
in
it
Claud
How
know
you
he
loves
her
John
I
heard
him
swear
his
affection
Bora
So
did
I
too
and
he
swore
he
would
marry
her
tonight
John
Come
let
us
to
the
banquet
Exeunt
Manet
Claudio
Claud
Thus
answer
I
in
name
of
Benedick
But
hear
these
ill
news
with
the
ears
of
Claudio
Unmasks
Tis
certain
so
The
Prince
wooes
for
himself
Friendship
is
constant
in
all
other
things
Save
in
the
office
and
affairs
of
love
Therefore
all
hearts
in
love
use
their
own
tongues
Let
every
eye
negotiate
for
itself
And
trust
no
agent
for
beauty
is
a
witch
Against
whose
charms
faith
melteth
into
blood
This
is
an
accident
of
hourly
proof
Which
I
mistrusted
not
Farewell
therefore
Hero
Enter
Benedick
unmasked
Bene
Count
Claudio
Claud
Yea
the
same
Bene
Come
will
you
go
with
me
Claud
Whither
Bene
Even
to
the
next
willow
about
your
own
business
County
What
fashion
will
you
wear
the
garland
of
about
your
neck
like
an
usurer
s
chain
or
under
your
arm
like
a
lieutenant
s
scarf
You
must
wear
it
one
way
for
the
Prince
hath
got
your
Hero
Claud
I
wish
him
joy
of
her
Bene
Why
that
s
spoken
like
an
honest
drovier
So
they
sell
bullocks
But
did
you
think
the
Prince
would
have
served
you
thus
Claud
I
pray
you
leave
me
Bene
Ho
now
you
strike
like
the
blind
man
Twas
the
boy
that
stole
your
meat
and
you
ll
beat
the
post
Claud
If
it
will
not
be
I
ll
leave
you
Exit
Bene
Alas
poor
hurt
fowl
now
will
he
creep
into
sedges
But
that
my
Lady
Beatrice
should
know
me
and
not
know
me
The
Prince
s
fool
Ha
it
may
be
I
go
under
that
title
because
I
am
merry
Yea
but
so
I
am
apt
to
do
myself
wrong
I
am
not
so
reputed
It
is
the
base
though
bitter
disposition
of
Beatrice
that
puts
the
world
into
her
person
and
so
gives
me
out
Well
I
ll
be
revenged
as
I
may
Enter
Don
Pedro
Pedro
Now
signior
where
s
the
Count
Did
you
see
him
Bene
Troth
my
lord
I
have
played
the
part
of
Lady
Fame
I
found
him
here
as
melancholy
as
a
lodge
in
a
warren
I
told
him
and
I
think
I
told
him
true
that
your
Grace
had
got
the
good
will
of
this
young
lady
and
I
off
red
him
my
company
to
a
willow
tree
either
to
make
him
a
garland
as
being
forsaken
or
to
bind
him
up
a
rod
as
being
worthy
to
be
whipt
Pedro
To
be
whipt
What
s
his
fault
Bene
The
flat
transgression
of
a
schoolboy
who
being
overjoyed
with
finding
a
bird
s
nest
shows
it
his
companion
and
he
steals
it
Pedro
Wilt
thou
make
a
trust
a
transgression
The
transgression
is
in
the
stealer
Bene
Yet
it
had
not
been
amiss
the
rod
had
been
made
and
the
garland
too
for
the
garland
he
might
have
worn
himself
and
the
rod
he
might
have
bestowed
on
you
who
as
I
take
it
have
stol
n
his
bird
s
nest
Pedro
I
will
but
teach
them
to
sing
and
restore
them
to
the
owner
Bene
If
their
singing
answer
your
saying
by
my
faith
you
say
honestly
