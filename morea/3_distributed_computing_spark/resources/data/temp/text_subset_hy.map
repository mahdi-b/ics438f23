Speak

That

of

Divide

When

ULYSSES
Troy
yet
upon
his
basis
had
been
down
And
the
great
Hector
s
sword
had
lack

a
master
But
for
these
instances
The
specialty
of
rule
hath
been
neglected
And
look
how
many
Grecian
tents
do
stand
Hollow
upon
this
plain
so
many
hollow
factions
When
that
the
general
is
not
like
the
hive
To
whom
the
foragers
shall
all
repair
What
honey
is
expected
Degree
being
vizarded
Th
unworthiest
shows
as
fairly

this

Observe
degree

and

Insisture
course
proportion

Office
and
custom
in

of

And
therefore

the

Sol
In

enthron

Amidst
the

whose

Corrects
the
ill
aspects
of

evil
And

the

Sans

to

But
when
the

In
evil
mixture
to
disorder
wander
What
plagues

what

what
mutiny
What
raging
of
the
sea
shaking
of

Commotion
in
the

Frights

Divert

The

Quite

O

Which

the

The

by

Take
but
degree
away
untune
that
string
And
hark
what
discord
follows
Each
thing
melts
In
mere
oppugnancy
the
bounded
waters
Should
lift
their
bosoms
higher
than
the
shores
And
make
a
sop
of
all
this

Strength
should
be
lord
of
imbecility
And
the
rude
son
should
strike
his
father
dead
Force
should
be
right
or
rather
right
and
wrong
Between
whose
endless
jar
justice
resides
Should
lose
their
names
and
so
should
justice
too
Then
everything
includes
itself
in
power
Power
into
will
will
into
appetite
And
appetite
an
universal
wolf
So
doubly
seconded
with
will
and
power
Must
make
perforce
an
universal
prey
And

eat
up

Great
Agamemnon
This

Of

Not

To

ULYSSES
The

The

of
our

Having
his

full
of
his
airy

Grows
dainty
of

Lies
mocking
our

with

Patroclus
Upon

Breaks
scurril

awkward

Sometime

Agamemnon
Thy
topless
deputation
he
puts
on
And
like
a
strutting
player
whose
conceit
Lies
in
his
hamstring
and
doth
think
it
rich
To
hear
the
wooden
dialogue
and
sound
Twixt
his

and
the
scaffoldage
Such
to
be
pitied
and
o

At

From

laughs

Cries

Now
play

Patroclus
Arming

And
then
forsooth
the
faint

Must

to
cough

And
with

fumbling

As

Makes
factious
feasts

of

Bold
as

Thersites
A

To

How

ULYSSES

call
it
cowardice
Count

Forestall

When

on

Of

the

weight
Why

Or

By

bid

Modest

Sir
you

call

Aeneas
AENEAS
Ay

that

AGAMEMNON
What

I
pray
you
AENEAS
Sir
pardon
tis
for
Agamemnon

AGAMEMNON
He
hears
nought
privately
that
comes
from
Troy
AENEAS
Nor
I
from
Troy
come
not
to
whisper
with
him
I
bring
a
trumpet
to
awake
his
ear
To
set
his
sense
on
the
attentive
bent
And
then
to
speak
AGAMEMNON
Speak
frankly
as

It

AENEAS
Trumpet
blow

Send
thy
brass

lazy

every
Greek
of

let
him
know
What
Troy
means
fairly
shall
be
spoke
aloud
Sound
trumpet
We
have
great
Agamemnon
here
in
Troy
A
prince
called
Hector
Priam
is
his
father
Who
in
this
dull
and
long
continued
truce
Is
resty
grown
he
bade
me
take
a
trumpet
And
to
this
purpose
speak
Kings
princes
lords
If
there
be
one
among
the
fair
st
of
Greece
That
holds
his
honour
higher
than
his
ease
That
seeks
his
praise
more
than
he
fears
his
peril
That
knows
his
valour
and
knows
not
his
fear
That
loves
his
mistress
more
than
in
confession
With
truant
vows
to
her
own
lips
he
loves
And
dare
avow
her
beauty
and
her
worth
In
other
arms
than
hers
to
him
this
challenge
Hector
in
view
of
Troyans
and
of
Greeks
Shall
make
it
good
or
do
his
best
to
do
it
He
hath
a
lady
wiser
fairer
truer
Than
ever
Greek
did
couple
in
his
arms
And
will
to
morrow
with
his
trumpet
call
Mid
way
between
your
tents
and
walls
of
Troy
To
rouse
a
Grecian
that
is
true
in
love
If
any
come
Hector
shall
honour
him
If
none
he
ll
say
in
Troy
when
he
retires
The
Grecian
dames
are
sunburnt
and
not
worth
The
splinter
of
a
lance
Even
so
much
AGAMEMNON
This
shall
be
told
our
lovers
Lord
Aeneas
If
none
of
them
have
soul
in
such
a
kind
We
left
them
all
at
home
But
we
are
soldiers
And
may
that
soldier
a
mere
recreant
prove
That
means
not
hath
not
or
is
not
in
love
If
then
one
is
or
hath
or
means
to
be
That
one
meets
Hector
if
none
else
I
am

NESTOR
Tell
him
of
Nestor
one
that
was
a
man
When
Hector
s
grandsire
suck

He
is
old
now
But
if
there
be
not
in
our
Grecian
mould
One
noble
man
that
hath
one
spark
of
fire
To
answer
for
his
love
tell
him
from
me
I
ll
hide
my
silver
beard
in
a
gold
beaver
And
in
my
vantbrace
put
this
wither
d
brawn
And
meeting
him
will
tell
him
that
my
lady
Was
fairer
than
his
grandame
and
as
chaste
As
may
be
in
the
world
His
youth
in
flood
I
ll
prove
this
truth
with
my
three
drops
of
blood
AENEAS
Now
heavens
forfend
such
scarcity
of
youth
ULYSSES
Amen
AGAMEMNON
Fair
Lord
Aeneas
let
me
touch
your
hand
To
our
pavilion
shall
I
lead
you
first
Achilles
shall
have
word
of
this
intent
So
shall
each
lord
of
Greece
from
tent
to
tent
Yourself
shall
feast
with
us
before
you
go
And
find
the
welcome
of
a
noble
foe
Exeunt
all
but
ULYSSES
and
NESTOR
ULYSSES
Nestor
NESTOR
What
says
Ulysses
ULYSSES
I
have
a
young
conception
in

Be
you
my

bring

to
some
shape
NESTOR
What
is

ULYSSES
This
tis
Blunt

The
seeded
pride
That
hath
to
this
maturity
blown

In

Achilles
must

now
be
cropp
d
Or
shedding
breed
a
nursery
of

To
overbulk

all
NESTOR
Well
and
how
ULYSSES
This
challenge
that
the
gallant
Hector
sends
However
it
is
spread
in
general
name
Relates
in
purpose
only
to
Achilles
NESTOR
True
The
purpose
is
perspicuous
even
as
substance
Whose
grossness
little
characters
sum
up
And
in
the
publication
make
no
strain
But
that
Achilles
were
his
brain
as
barren
As
banks
of
Libya
though
Apollo
knows
Tis
dry
enough
will
with
great
speed
of
judgment
Ay
with
celerity
find
Hector
s
purpose
Pointing
on
him
ULYSSES
And
wake
him
to
the
answer
think
you
NESTOR
Why
tis
most
meet
Who
may
you
else
oppose
That
can
from
Hector
bring
those
honours
off
If
not
Achilles
Though
t
be
a
sportful
combat
Yet
in
this
trial
much
opinion
dwells
For
here
the
Troyans
taste
our
dear
st
repute
With
their
fin
st
palate
and
trust
to
me
Ulysses
Our
imputation
shall
be
oddly
pois

In
this
vile
action
for
the
success
Although
particular
shall
give
a
scantling
Of
good
or
bad
unto
the
general
And
in
such
indexes
although
small
pricks
To
their
subsequent
volumes
there
is
seen
The
baby
figure
of
the
giant
mas
Of

at

It
is

He
that
meets
Hector
issues
from
our
choice
And
choice
being
mutual
act
of
all
our
souls
Makes
merit
her
election
and
doth
boil
As

Out

What

To

In
no

working

ULYSSES
Give
pardon
to
my
speech
Therefore
tis
meet
Achilles
meet
not
Hector
Let
us
like
merchants
show
our
foulest
wares
And
think
perchance
they
ll
sell
if
not

lustre
Of
the
better
yet
to

shall
show
the
better
By
showing
the
worst

Do
not
consent
That
ever
Hector
and
Achilles

For
both
our
honour
and
our
shame
in
this
Are
dogg

two
strange
followers
NESTOR
I
see
them
not

are

ULYSSES
What
glory
our
Achilles
shares
from
Hector
Were
he
not
proud
we
all
should
wear
with
him
But
he
already
is
too
insolent
And
it
were
better
parch
in
Afric
sun
Than
in
the
pride
and
salt
scorn
of
his
eyes
Should
he
scape
Hector

If

Why

our
main

crush
In

man
No
make

And
by
device
let
blockish
Ajax
draw
The
sort
to
fight
with
Hector
Among
ourselves
Give
him
allowance
for
the
better
man
For
that
will
physic
the
great
Myrmidon
Who
broils
in
loud
applause
and
make

His

prouder
than

THERSITES
Thou
