Signior
Lucentio
this
is
the
pointed
day
That
Katherine
and
Petruchio
should
be
married
And
yet
we
hear
not
of
our
son
in
law
What
will
be
said
What
mockery
will
it
be
To
want
the
bridegroom
when
the
priest
attends
To
speak
the
ceremonial
rites
of
marriage
What
says
Lucentio
to
this
shame
of
ours
KATHERINA
No
shame
but
mine
I
must
forsooth
be
forc

To
give
my
hand

against
my
heart
Unto
a
mad
brain
rudesby
full
of
spleen
Who
woo
d
in
haste
and
means
to
wed
at
leisure
I
told
you
I
he
was
a
frantic
fool
Hiding
his
bitter
jests
in
blunt
behaviour
And
to
be
noted
for
a
merry
man
He
ll
woo
a
thousand
point
the
day
of
marriage
Make
friends
invited
and
proclaim
the
banns
Yet
never
means
to
wed
where
he
hath
woo
d
Now
must
the
world
point
at
poor
Katherine
And
say
Lo
there
is
mad
Petruchio
s
wife
If
it
would
please
him
come

marry
her
TRANIO
Patience
good
Katherine

Baptista

Upon

Petruchio

well
Whatever
fortune
stays
him

his
word
Though
he

blunt
I
know
him
passing
wise
Though
he
be
merry

BIANCA

BAPTISTA
Go
girl
I
cannot
blame
thee
now

For

Much

Not

As
I
wish
you
were
PETRUCHIO
Were
it
better
I
should
rush
in
thus
But
where
is
Kate
Where
is
my
lovely
bride
How
does
my
father
Gentles
methinks
you
frown
And
wherefore
gaze
this
goodly
company
As
if
they
saw
some
wondrous
monument
Some
comet
or
unusual
prodigy
BAPTISTA
Why
sir
you
know
this
is
your
wedding
day
First
were
we
sad
fearing
you
would
not
come
Now
sadder
that
you
come
so
unprovided
Fie
doff
this
habit
shame
to
your
estate
An
eye
sore
to
our
solemn
festival
TRANIO
And
tell
us
what
occasion
of
import
Hath
all
so
long
detain
d
you
from
your
wife
And
sent
you
hither
so
unlike
yourself
PETRUCHIO
Tedious
it
were
to
tell
and
harsh
to
hear
Sufficeth
I
am
come
to
keep
my
word
Though
in
some
part
enforced
to
digress
Which
at
more
leisure
I
will
so
excuse
As
you
shall
well
be
satisfied
withal
But
where
is
Kate
I
stay
too
long
from
her
The
morning
wears
tis
time
we
were
at
church
TRANIO
See
not
your
bride
in
these
unreverent
robes
Go
to
my
chamber
put
on
clothes
of
mine
PETRUCHIO
Not
I
believe
me
thus
I
ll
visit
her
BAPTISTA
But
thus
I
trust
you
will
not
marry
her
PETRUCHIO
Good
sooth
even
thus
therefore
ha
done
with
words
To
me
she
s
married
not
unto
my
clothes
Could
I
repair
what
she
will
wear
in
me
As
I
can
change
these
poor
accoutrements
Twere
well
for
Kate
and
better
for
myself
But
what
a
fool
am
I
to
chat
with
you
When
I
should
bid
good
morrow
to
my
bride
And
seal
the
title
with
a
lovely
kiss
Exeunt
PETRUCHIO
and
PETRUCHIO
TRANIO
He
hath
some
meaning
in
his
mad
attire
We
will
persuade
him
be
it
possible
To
put
on
better
ere
he
go
to
church

I

after
him

Exeunt

But
to

Her

liking
which
to
bring
to
pass
As
I
before
imparted
to
your
worship
I
am
to
get
a
man
whate
er
he
be
It
skills
not
much
we
ll
fit
him
to
our
turn
And
he
shall
be
Vincentio
of
Pisa
And
make
assurance
here
in
Padua
Of
greater
sums
than
I
have
promised
So
shall
you
quietly
enjoy
your
hope
And
marry
sweet
Bianca
with
consent
LUCENTIO
Were
it
not
that
my
fellow
schoolmaster
Doth
watch
Bianca
s
steps
so
narrowly
Twere
good
methinks
to
steal
our
marriage
Which
once
perform
d
let
all
the
world
say
no
I
ll
keep
mine
own
despite
of
all
the
world

by
degrees
we
mean
to
look
into
And
watch
our
vantage
in
this
business
We

the
greybeard
Gremio
The
narrow
prying

The

All

Signior

GREMIO
As
willingly

I
came
from

TRANIO
And

the
bride
and
bridegroom
coming
home
GREMIO
A
bridegroom
say
you
Tis
a
groom
indeed
A
grumbling
groom
and
that
the
girl
shall
find
TRANIO
Curster
than
she
Why
tis
impossible
GREMIO
Why
he
s
a
devil

devil
a
very
fiend
TRANIO
Why
she
s
a
devil
a
devil
the
devil

dam
GREMIO
Tut
she
s
a
lamb
a
dove
a
fool
to
him
I
ll
tell
you
Sir
Lucentio
when
the
priest
Should
ask
if
Katherine
should
be
his
wife
Ay
by
gogs
wouns
quoth
he
and
swore
so
loud
That
all
amaz
d
the
priest
let
fall
the
book
And
as
he
stoop
d
again
to
take
it
up
This
mad
brain
d
bridegroom
took
him
such
a
cuff
That
down
fell
priest
and
book
and
book
and
priest
Now
take
them
up
quoth
he
if
any
list
TRANIO
What
said
the
wench
when
he
rose
again
GREMIO
Trembled
and
shook
for
why
he
stamp
d
and
swore
As
if
the
vicar
meant
to
cozen
him
But
after
many
ceremonies
done
He
calls
for
wine
A
health
quoth
he
as
if
He
had
been
abroad
carousing
to
his
mates
After
a
storm
quaff
d
off
the
muscadel
And
threw
the
sops
all
in
the
sexton
s
face
Having
no
other
reason
But
that
his
beard
grew
thin
and
hungerly
And
seem
d
to
ask
him
sops
as
he
was
drinking
This
done
he
took
the
bride
about
the
neck
And
kiss
d
her
lips
with
such
a
clamorous
smack
That
at
the
parting
all
the
church
did
echo
And
I
seeing
this
came
thence
for
very
shame
And
after
me
I
know
the
rout
is
coming
Such
a
mad
marriage
never
was
before
Hark
hark
I
hear
the
minstrels
