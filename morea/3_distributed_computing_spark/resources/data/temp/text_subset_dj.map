Broach

revenge
Brother

So

KING
HENRY
alone
KING
HENRY
This
battle
fares
like
to
the
morning
s
war
When
dying
clouds
contend
with
growing
light
What
time
the
shepherd
blowing
of
his
nails
Can
neither
call
it
perfect
day
nor
night
Now
sways
it
this
way
like
a
mighty
sea
Forc
d
by
the
tide
to
combat
with
the
wind
Now
sways
it
that
way
like
the
selfsame
sea
Forc
d
to
retire
by
fury
of
the
wind
Sometime
the
flood
prevails
and
then
the
wind
Now
one
the
better
then
another
best
Both
tugging
to
be
victors
breast
to
breast
Yet
neither
conqueror
nor
conquered
So
is
the
equal
poise
of
this
fell
war
Here
on
this
molehill
will
I
sit
me
down
To
whom
God
will
there
be
the
victory
For
Margaret
my
queen
and
Clifford
too
Have
chid
me
from
the
battle
swearing
both
They
prosper
best
of
all
when
I
am
thence
Would
I
were
dead
if
God
s
good
will
were
so
For
what
is
in
this
world
but
grief
and
woe
O
God
methinks
it
were
a
happy
life
To
be
no
better
than
a
homely
swain
To
sit
upon
a
hill
as
I
do
now
To
carve
out
dials
quaintly
point
by
point
Thereby
to
see
the
minutes
how
they
run
How
many
makes
the
hour
full
complete
How
many
hours
brings
about
the
day
How
many
days
will
finish
up
the
year
How
many
years
a
mortal
man
may
live
When
this
is
known
then
to
divide
the
times
So
many
hours
must
I
tend
my
flock
So
many
hours
must
I
take
my
rest
So
many
hours
must
I
contemplate
So
many
hours
must
I
sport
myself
So
many
days
my
ewes
have
been
with
young
So
many
weeks
ere
the
poor
fools
will
can
So
many
years
ere
I
shall
shear
the
fleece
So
minutes
hours
days
months
and
years
Pass
d
over
to
the
end
they
were
created
Would
bring
white
hairs
unto
a
quiet
grave
Ah
what
a
life
were
this
how
sweet
how
lovely
Gives
not
the
hawthorn
bush
a
sweeter
shade
To
shepherds
looking
on
their
silly
sheep
Than
doth
a
rich
embroider
d

To

O

All

Is
far
beyond
a

His

forth
But
set
his
murd
ring
knife
unto
the
root
From
whence
that
tender
spray
did
sweetly
spring
I
mean
our
princely
father
Duke
of
York
WARWICK
From
off
the
gates
of
York
fetch
down
the
head
Your
father
s
head
which
Clifford
placed
there
Instead
whereof
let
this
supply
the
room
Measure
for
measure
must
be
answered
EDWARD
Bring
forth
that
fatal
screech
owl
to
our
house
That
nothing
sung
but
death
to
us
and
ours
Now
death
shall
stop
his
dismal
threat
ning
sound
And
his
ill
boding
tongue
no
more
shall
speak
WARWICK
I
think
his
understanding
is
bereft
Speak
Clifford
dost
thou
know
who
speaks
to
thee
Dark
cloudy
death
o
ershades
his
beams
of
life
And
he
nor
sees
nor
hears
us
what
we
say
RICHARD
O
would
he
did
and
so
perhaps
he
doth
Tis
but
his
policy
to
counterfeit
Because
he
would
avoid
such
bitter
taunts
Which
in
the
time
of
death
he
gave
our
father
GEORGE
If
so
thou
think
st
vex
him
with
eager
words
RICHARD
Clifford
ask
mercy
and
obtain
no
grace
EDWARD
Clifford
repent
in
bootless
penitence
WARWICK
Clifford
devise
excuses
for
thy
faults
GEORGE
While
we
devise
fell
tortures
for
thy
faults
RICHARD
Thou
didst
love
York
and
I
am
son
to
York
EDWARD
Thou
pitied
st
Rutland
I
will
pity
thee
GEORGE
Where
s
Captain
Margaret
to
fence
you
now
WARWICK
They
mock
thee
Clifford
swear
as
thou
wast
wont
RICHARD
What
not
an
oath
Nay
then
the
world
goes
hard
When
Clifford
cannot
spare
his
friends
an
oath
I
know
by
that
he
s
dead
and
by
my
soul
If
this
right
hand
would
buy
two
hours
life
That
I
in
all
despite
might
rail
at
him
This
hand
should
chop
it
off
and
with
the
issuing
blood
Stifle
the
villain
whose
unstanched
thirst
York
and
young
Rutland
could
not
satisfy
WARWICK
Ay
but
he
s
dead
Off
with
the
traitor
s
head
And
rear
it
in
the
place
your
father
s
stands
And
now
to
London
with
triumphant
march
There
to
be
crowned
England
s
royal
King
From
whence
shall
Warwick
cut
the
sea
to
France
And
ask
the
Lady
Bona
for
thy
queen
So
shalt
thou
sinew
both
these
lands
together
And
having
France
thy
friend
thou
shalt
not
dread
The
scatt
red
foe
that
hopes
to
rise
again
For
though
they
cannot
greatly
sting
to
hurt
Yet
look
to
have
them
buzz
to
offend
thine
ears
First
will
I
see
the
coronation
And
then
to
Brittany
I
ll
cross
the
sea
To
effect
this
marriage
so
it
please
my
lord
EDWARD
Even
as
thou
wilt
sweet
Warwick
let
it
be
For
in
thy
shoulder
do
I
build
my
seat
And
never
will
I
undertake
the
thing
Wherein
thy
counsel
and
consent
is
wanting
Richard
I
will
create
thee
Duke
of
Gloucester
And
George
of
Clarence
Warwick
as
ourself
Shall
do
and
undo
as
him
pleaseth
best
RICHARD
Let
me
be
Duke
of
Clarence
George
of
Gloucester
For
Gloucester
s
dukedom
is
too
ominous
WARWICK
Tut
that
s
a
foolish
observation
Richard
be
Duke
of
Gloucester
Now
to
London
To
see
these
honours
in
possession

III
SCENE
I
A
chase
in
the
north
of
England
Enter
two
KEEPERS
with
cross
bows
in
their
hands
FIRST
KEEPER
Under
this
thick
grown
brake
we
ll
shroud
ourselves
For
through
this
laund
anon
the
deer
will
come
And
in
this
covert
will
we
make
our
stand
Culling
the
principal
of
all
the
deer
SECOND
KEEPER
I
ll
stay
above
the
hill
so
both
may
shoot
FIRST
KEEPER
That
cannot
be
the
noise
of
thy
cross
bow
Will
scare
the
herd
and
so
my
shoot
is
lost
Here
stand
we
both
and
aim
we
at
the
best
And
for
the
time
shall
not
seem
tedious
I
ll
tell
thee
what
befell
me
on
a
day
In
this
self
place
where
now
we
mean
to
stand
SECOND
KEEPER
Here
comes
a
man
let
s
stay
till
he
be
past
Enter
KING
HENRY
disguised
with
a
prayer
book
KING
HENRY
From
Scotland
am
I
stol
n
even
of
pure
love
To
greet
mine
own
land
with
my
wishful
sight
No
Harry
Harry
tis
no
land
of
thine
Thy
place
is
fill
d
thy
sceptre
wrung
from
thee
Thy
balm
wash
d
off
wherewith
thou
wast
anointed
No
bending
knee
will
call
thee
Caesar
now
No
humble
suitors
press
to
speak
for
right
No
not
a
man
comes
for
redress
of
thee
For
how
can
I
help
them
and
not
myself
FIRST
KEEPER
Ay
here
s
a
deer
whose
skin
s
a
keeper
s
fee
This
is
the
quondam
King
let
s
seize
upon
him
KING
HENRY
Let
me
embrace
thee
sour
adversity
For
wise
men
say
it
is
the
wisest
course
SECOND
KEEPER
Why
linger
we
let
us
lay
hands
upon
him
FIRST
KEEPER
Forbear
awhile
we
ll
hear
a
little
more
KING
HENRY
My
Queen
and
son
are
gone
to
France
for
aid
And
as
I
hear
the
great
commanding
Warwick
Is
thither
gone
to
crave
the
French
King
s
sister
To
wife
for
Edward
If
this
news
be
true
Poor
queen
and
son
your
labour
is
but
lost
For
Warwick
is
a
subtle
orator
And
Lewis
a
prince
soon
won
with
moving
words
By
this
account
then
Margaret
may
win
him
For
she
s
a
woman
to
be
pitied
much
Her
sighs
will
make
a
batt
ry
in
his
breast
Her
tears
will
pierce
into
a
marble
heart
The
tiger
will
be
mild
whiles
she
doth
mourn
And
Nero
will
be
tainted
with
remorse
To
hear
and
see
her
plaints
her
brinish
tears
Ay
but
she
s
come
to
beg
Warwick
to
give
She
on
his
left
side
craving
aid
for
Henry
He
on
his
right
asking
a
wife
for
Edward
She
weeps
and
says
her
Henry
is
depos
d
He
smiles
and
says
his
Edward
is
install
d
That
she
poor
wretch
for
grief
can
speak
no
more
Whiles
Warwick
tells
his
title
smooths
the
wrong
Inferreth
arguments
of
mighty
strength
And
in
conclusion
wins
the
King
from
her
With
promise
of
his
sister
and
what
else
To
strengthen
and
support
King
Edward
s
place
O
Margaret
thus
twill
be
and
thou
poor
soul
Art
then
forsaken
as
thou
went
st
forlorn
SECOND
KEEPER
Say
what
art
thou
that
talk
st
of
kings
and
queens
KING
HENRY
More
than
I
seem
and
less
than
I
was
born
to
A
man
at
least
for
less
I
should
not
be
And
men
may
talk
of
kings
and
why
not
I
SECOND
KEEPER
Ay
but
thou
talk
st
as
if
thou
wert
a
king
KING
HENRY
Why
so
I
am
in
mind
and
that
s
enough
SECOND
KEEPER
But
if
thou
be
a
king
where
is
thy
crown
KING
HENRY
My
crown
is
in
my
heart
not
on
my
head
Not
deck
d
with
diamonds
and
Indian
stones
Not
to
be
seen
My
crown
is
call
d
content
A
crown
it
is
that
seldom
kings
enjoy
SECOND
KEEPER
Well
if
you
be
a
king
crown
d
with
content
Your
crown
content
and
you
must
be
contented
To
go
along
with
us
for
as
we
think
You
are
the
king
King
Edward
hath
depos
d
And
we
his
subjects
sworn
in
all
allegiance
Will
apprehend
you
as
his
enemy
KING
HENRY
But
did
you
never
swear
and
break
an
oath
SECOND
KEEPER
No
never
such
an
oath
nor
will
not
now
KING
HENRY
Where
did
you
dwell
when
I
was
King
of
England
SECOND
KEEPER
Here
in
this
country
where
we
now
remain
KING
HENRY
I
was
anointed
king
at
nine
months
old
My
father
and
my
grandfather
were
kings
And
you
were
sworn
true
subjects
unto
me
And
tell
me
then
have
you
not
broke
your
oaths
FIRST
KEEPER
No
For
we
were
subjects
but
while
you
were
king
KING
HENRY
Why
am
I
dead
Do
I
not
breathe
a
man
Ah
simple
men
you
know
not
what
you
swear
Look
as
I
blow
this
feather
from
my
face
And
as
the
air
blows
it
to
me
again
Obeying
with
my
wind
when
I
do
blow
And
yielding
to
another
when
it
blows
Commanded
always
by
the
greater
gust
Such
is
the
lightness
of
you
common
men
But
do
not
break
your
oaths
for
of
that
sin
My
mild
entreaty
shall
not
make
you
guilty
Go
where
you
will
the
King
shall
be
commanded
And
be
you
kings
command
and
I
ll
obey
FIRST
KEEPER
We
are
true
subjects
to
the
King
King
Edward
KING
HENRY
So
would
you
be
again
to
Henry
If
he
were
seated
as
King
Edward
is
FIRST
KEEPER
We
charge
you
in
God
s
name
and
the
King

To
go
with
us
unto
the
officers
