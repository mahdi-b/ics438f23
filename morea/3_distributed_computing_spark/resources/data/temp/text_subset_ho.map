FLAMINIUS
Faith

I

Nothing

Alas
good
lord
a
noble

Many

I

told
him

to
him
of

Every

This

Unto

When

A

Enter
Lucius
with
three
STRANGERS
LUCIUS
Who
the
Lord
Timon
He
is
my
very
good
friend
and
an
honourable
gentleman
FIRST
STRANGER
We
know
him
for
no
less
though
we
are
but
strangers
to
him
But
I
can
tell
you
one
thing
my
lord
and
which
I
hear
from
common
rumours
now
Lord
Timon
s
happy
hours
are
done
and
past
and
his
estate
shrinks
from
him
LUCIUS
Fie
no
do
not
believe
it
he
cannot
want
for
money
SECOND
STRANGER
But
believe
you
this
my
lord
that
not
long
ago
one
of
his
men
was
with
the
Lord
Lucullus
to
borrow
so
many
talents
nay
urg
d
extremely
for
t
and
showed
what
necessity
belong
d
to
t
and
yet
was
denied
LUCIUS
How
SECOND
STRANGER
I
tell
you
denied
my
lord
LUCIUS
What
a
strange
case
was
that
Now
before
the
gods
I
am
asham
d
on
t
Denied
that
honourable
man
There
was
very
little
honour
show
d
in
t
For
my
own
part
I
must
needs
confess
I
have
received
some
small
kindnesses
from
him
as
money
plate
jewels
and
such
like
trifles
nothing
comparing
to
his
yet
had
he
mistook
him
and
sent
to
me
I
should
ne
er
have
denied
his
occasion
so
many
talents
Enter
SERVILIUS
SERVILIUS
See
by

Servilius
You
are
kindly

sir
Fare
thee
well
commend
me
to
thy
honourable
virtuous
lord
my
very
exquisite
friend
SERVILIUS
May
it
please
your
honour
my
lord
hath
sent
LUCIUS
Ha
What
has
he
sent
I
am
so
much
endeared
to
that
lord
he
s
ever
sending
How
shall
I
thank
him
think
st
thou
And
what
has
he
sent
now
SERVILIUS
Has
only
sent
his
present
occasion
now
my
lord
requesting
your
lordship
to
supply
his
instant
use
with
so
many
talents
LUCIUS
I
know
his
lordship
is
but
merry
with
me
He
cannot
want
fifty
five
hundred
talents
SERVILIUS
But
in
the
mean
time
he
wants
less
my
lord
If
his
occasion
were
not
virtuous
I
should
not
urge
it
half
so
faithfully
LUCIUS
Dost
thou
speak
seriously
Servilius
SERVILIUS
Upon
my
soul
tis
true
sir
LUCIUS
What
a
wicked
beast
was
I
to
disfurnish
myself
against
such
a
good
time
when
I
might
ha
shown
myself
honourable
How
unluckily
it
happ
ned
that
I
should
purchase
the
day
before
for
a
little
part
and
undo
a
great
deal
of
honour
Servilius
now
before
the
gods
I
am
not
able
to
do
the
more
beast
I
say
I
was
sending
to
use
Lord
Timon
myself
these
gentlemen
can
witness
but
I
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
Athens
I
had
done
t
now
Commend
me
bountifully
to
his
good
lordship
and
I
hope
his
honour
will
conceive
the
fairest
of
me
because
I
have
no
power
to
be
kind
And
tell
him
this
from
me
I
count
it
one
of
my
greatest
afflictions
say
that
I
cannot
pleasure
such
an
honourable
gentleman
Good
Servilius
will
you
befriend
me
so
far
as
to
use
mine
own
words
to
him
SERVILIUS
Yes
sir
I
shall
LUCIUS
I
ll
look
you
out
a
good
turn
Servilius
Exit
SERVILIUS
True
as
you
said
Timon
is
shrunk
indeed
And
he
that

once
denied
will
hardly
speed
Exit
FIRST
STRANGER
Do
you
observe
this
Hostilius
SECOND
STRANGER
Ay
too
well
FIRST
STRANGER
Why
this
is
the
world
s
soul
and
just
of
the
same
piece
Is
every
flatterer
s
spirit
Who
can
call
him
his
friend
That
dips
in
the
same
dish
For
in
my
knowing
Timon
has
been
this
lord
s
father
And
kept
his
credit
with
his
purse
Supported
his
estate
nay
Timon
s
money
Has
paid
his
men
their
wages
He
ne
er
drinks
But
Timon
s
silver
treads
upon
his
lip
And
yet
O
see
the
monstrousness
of
man
When
he
looks
out
in
an
ungrateful
shape
He
does
deny
him
in
respect
of
his
What
charitable
men
afford
to
beggars
THIRD
STRANGER
Religion
groans
at
it
FIRST
STRANGER
For
mine
own
part
I
never
tasted
Timon
in
my
life
Nor
came
any
of
his
bounties
over
me
To
mark
me
for
his
friend
yet
I
protest
For
his
right
noble
mind
illustrious
virtue
And
honourable
carriage
Had
his
necessity
made
use
of
me
I
would
have
put
my
wealth
into
donation
And
the
best
half
should
have
return
d
to
him
So
much
I
love
his
heart
But
I
perceive
Men
must
learn
now
with
pity
to
dispense
For
policy
sits
above
conscience

My

How
Have

Has
Ventidius
and
Lucullus
denied
him
And
does
he
send

Three
Humh
It

little
love
or
judgment
in

Must
I
be
his
last

His

Thrice

over
Must

Has
much
disgrac
d
me
in

I
m
angry
at
him
That
might
have
known
my
place
I
see
no
sense
for
t
But
his
occasions
might
have
woo
d
me
first
For
in
my
conscience
I
was
the
first
man
That
e

received
gift
from
him
And
does
he
think
so
backwardly
of
me
now
That
I
ll
requite
it
last
No
So
it
may
prove
an
argument
of
laughter
To
th
rest

I
mongst
lords
be
thought
a
fool
I
d
rather
than
the
worth
of
thrice

Had
sent

such
a

himself

and
I
cannot
think
but
in
the
end
the
villainies
of
man
will
set
him
clear
How
fairly
this
lord
strives
to
appear
foul
Takes
virtuous
copies
to
be
wicked
like
those
that
under
hot
ardent
zeal
would
set
whole
realms
on
fire
Of
such
a
nature
is
his
politic
love
This
was
my

Save

SCENE
V
The
Senate
House
Enter
three
SENATORS
at
one
door
ALCIBIADES
meeting
them
with
attendants
FIRST
SENATOR
My
lord
you
have
my
voice
to
t
the
fault
s
bloody
Tis
necessary
he
should
die
Nothing
emboldens
sin
so
much
as
mercy
SECOND
SENATOR
Most
true
the
law
shall
bruise
him
ALCIBIADES
Honour
health
and
compassion
to
the
Senate
FIRST
SENATOR
Now
Captain
ALCIBIADES
I
am
an
humble
suitor
to
your
virtues
For
pity
is
the
virtue
of
the
law
And
none
but
tyrants
use
it
cruelly
It
pleases
time
and
fortune
to
lie
heavy
Upon
a
friend
of
mine
who
in
hot
blood
Hath
stepp
d
into
the
law
which
is
past
depth
To
those
that
without
heed
do
plunge
into
t
He
is
a
man
setting
his
fate
aside
Of
comely
virtues
Nor
did
he
soil
the
fact
with
cowardice
An
honour
in
him
which
buys
out
his
fault
But
with
a
noble
fury
and
fair
spirit
Seeing
his
reputation
touch
d
to
death
He
did
oppose
his
foe
And
with
such
sober
and
unnoted
passion
He
did
behove
his
anger
ere
twas
spent
As
if
he
had
but
prov
d
an
argument
FIRST
SENATOR
You
undergo
too
strict
a
paradox
Striving
to
make
an
ugly
deed
look
fair
Your
words
have
took
such
pains
as
if
they
labour
d
To
bring
manslaughter
into
form
and
set
Quarrelling
upon
the
head
of
valour
which
indeed
Is
valour
misbegot
and
came
into
the
world
When
sects
and
factions
were
newly
born
He
s
truly
valiant
that
can
wisely
suffer
The
worst
that
man
can
breathe
And
make
his
wrongs
his
outsides
To
wear
them
like
his
raiment
carelessly
And
ne
er
prefer
his
injuries
to
his
heart
To
bring
it
into
danger
If
wrongs
be
evils
and
enforce
us
kill
What
folly
tis
to
hazard
life
for
ill
ALCIBIADES
My
lord
FIRST
SENATOR
You
cannot
make
gross
sins
look
clear
To
revenge
is
no
valour
but
to
bear
ALCIBIADES
My
lords
then
under
favour
pardon
me
If
I
speak
like
a
captain
Why
do
fond
men
expose
themselves
to
battle
And
not
endure
all
threats
Sleep
upon
t
And
let
the
foes
quietly
cut
their
throats
Without
repugnancy
If
there
be
Such
valour
in
the
bearing
what
make
we
Abroad
Why
then
women
are
more
valiant
That
stay
at
home
if
bearing
carry
it
And
the
ass
more
captain
than
the
lion
the
fellow
Loaden
with
irons
wiser
than
the
judge
If
wisdom
be
in
suffering
O
my
lords
As
you
are
great
be
pitifully
good
Who
cannot
condemn
rashness
in
cold
blood
To
kill
I
grant
is
sin
s
extremest
gust
But
in
defence
by
mercy
tis
most
just
To
be
in
anger
is
impiety
But
who
is
man
that
is
not
angry
Weigh
but
the
crime
with
this
SECOND
SENATOR
You
breathe
in
vain
ALCIBIADES
In
vain
His
service
done
At
Lacedaemon
and
Byzantium
Were
a
sufficient
briber
for
his
life
FIRST
SENATOR
What
s
that
ALCIBIADES
Why
I
say
my
lords
has
done
fair
service
And
slain
in
fight
many
of
your
enemies
How
full
of
valour
did
he
bear
himself
In
the
last
conflict
and
made
plenteous
wounds
SECOND
SENATOR
He
has
made
too
much
plenty
with
em
He
s
a
sworn
rioter
he
has
a
sin
that
often
Drowns
him
and
takes
his
valour
prisoner
If
there
were
no
foes
that
were
enough
To
overcome
him
In
that
beastly
fury
He
has
been
known
to
commit
outrages
And
cherish
factions
Tis
inferr
d
to
us
His
days
are
foul
and
his
drink
dangerous
FIRST
SENATOR
He
dies
ALCIBIADES
Hard
fate
He
might
have
died
in
war
My
lords
if
not
for
any
parts
in
him
Though
his
right
arm
might
purchase
his
own
time
And
be
in
debt
to
none
yet
more
to
move
you
Take
my
deserts
to
his
and
join
em
both
And
for
I
know
your
reverend
ages
love
Security
I
ll
pawn
my
victories
all
My
honours
to
you
upon
his
good
returns
If
by
this
crime
he
owes
the
law
his
life
Why
let
the
war
receive
t
in
valiant
gore
For
law
is
strict
and
war
is
nothing
more
FIRST
SENATOR
We
are
for
law
he
dies
Urge
it
no
more
On
height
of
our
displeasure
Friend
or
brother
He
forfeits
his
own
blood
that
spills
another
ALCIBIADES
Must
it
be
so
It
must
not
be
My
lords
I
do
beseech
you
know
me
SECOND
SENATOR
How
ALCIBIADES
Call
me
to
your
remembrances
THIRD
SENATOR
What
ALCIBIADES
I
cannot
think
but
your
age
has
forgot
me
It
could
not
else
be
I
should
prove
so
base
To
sue
and
be
denied
such
common
grace
My
wounds
ache
at
you
FIRST
SENATOR
Do
you
dare
our
anger
Tis
in
few
words
but
spacious
in
effect
We
banish
thee
for
ever
ALCIBIADES
Banish
me
Banish
your
dotage
Banish
usury
That
makes
the
Senate
ugly
FIRST
SENATOR
If
after
two
days
shine
Athens
contain
thee
Attend
our
weightier
judgment
And
not
to
swell
our
spirit
He
shall
be
executed
presently
Exeunt
SENATORS
ALCIBIADES
Now
the
gods
keep
you
old
enough
that
you
may
live
Only
in
bone
that
none
may
look
on
you
I
m
worse
than
mad
I
have
kept
back
their
foes
While
they
have
told
their
money
and
let
out
Their
coin
upon
large
interest
I
myself
Rich
only
in
large
hurts
All
those
for
this
Is
this
the
balsam
that
the
usuring
Senate
Pours
into
captains
wounds
Banishment
It
comes
not
ill
I
hate
not
to
be
banish
d
It
is
a
cause
worthy
my
spleen
and
fury
That
I
may
strike
at
Athens
I
ll
cheer
up
My
discontented
troops
and
lay
for
hearts
Tis
honour
with
most
lands
to
be
at
odds
Soldiers
should
brook
as
little
wrongs
as
gods
Exit

several
doors
FIRST
LORD
The
good
time
of
day
to
you
sir
SECOND
LORD
I
also
wish
it
to
you
I
think
this
honourable
lord
did
but
try
us
this
other
day
FIRST
LORD
Upon
that
were
my
thoughts
tiring
when
we
encount
red
I
hope
it
is
not
so
low
with
him
as
he
made
it
seem
in
the
trial
of
his
several
friends
SECOND
LORD
It
should
not
be
by
the
persuasion
of
his
new
feasting
FIRST
LORD
I
should
think
so
He
hath
sent
me
an
earnest
inviting
which
many
my
near
occasions
did
urge
me
to
put
off
but
he
hath
conjur
d
me
beyond
them
and
I
must
needs
appear
SECOND
LORD
In
like
manner
was
I
in
debt
to
my
importunate
business
but
he
would
not
hear
my
excuse
I
am
sorry
when
he
sent
to
borrow
of
me
that
my
provision
was
out
FIRST
LORD
I
am
sick
of
that
grief
too
as
I
understand
how
all
things
go
SECOND
LORD
Every
man
here
s
so
What
would
he
have
borrowed
of
you
FIRST
LORD
A
thousand
pieces
SECOND
LORD
A
thousand
pieces

What

FIRST
LORD
Ever

hearing
well
of
your
lordship
SECOND
LORD
The
swallow
follows

summer

willing
than

your
lordship
TIMON
Aside
Nor
more
willingly
leaves
winter
such
summer
birds
are
men
Gentlemen
our
dinner
will
not
recompense
this
long
stay
feast
your
ears
with
the
music
awhile
if
they
will
fare
so
harshly
o
th
trumpet

sound

shall

presently
FIRST
LORD
I
hope
it
remains
not
unkindly
with
your
lordship
that
I
return
d
you
an
empty
messenger
TIMON
O
sir
let
it
not
trouble
you
SECOND
LORD
My
noble
lord
TIMON
Ah
my
good
friend
what
cheer
SECOND
LORD
My
most
honourable
lord
I
am
e
en
sick
of
shame
that
when
your
lordship
this
other
day
sent
to
me
I
was
so
unfortunate
a
beggar
TIMON
Think
not
on
t
sir
SECOND
LORD
If
you
had
sent
but
two
hours
before
TIMON
Let
it
not
cumber
your
better
remembrance
The
banquet
brought
in
Come
bring
in
all
together
SECOND
LORD
All

LORD
Royal
