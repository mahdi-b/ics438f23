Gloucester

To

Where

All

I

Peasant

When

hill
Edg
You

Look

Methinks

Horrible
steep
Hark

you
hear

Glou
No

Edg
Why
then
your
other

grow
imperfect
By
your

anguish

So
may
it

Methinks

In

But
in

Methinks

Come
on
sir
here
s
the
place
Stand
still
How
fearful
And
dizzy
tis
to
cast
one
s
eyes
so
low
The
crows
and
choughs
that
wing
the
midway
air
Show
scarce
so
gross
as
beetles
Halfway
down
Hangs
one
that
gathers
sampire
dreadful
trade
Methinks
he
seems
no
bigger
than
his
head
The
fishermen
that
walk
upon
the
beach
Appear
like
mice

yond
tall
anchoring
bark
Diminish
d
to
her
cock
her
cock
a
buoy
Almost
too
small
for
sight
The
murmuring
surge
That
on
th
unnumb
red
idle
pebble
chafes
Cannot
be
heard
so
high
I
ll
look
no
more
Lest
my
brain
turn
and
the
deficient
sight
Topple
down
headlong
Glou
Set
me
where
you
stand
Edg
Give
me
your
hand
You
are
now
within
a
foot
Of
th
extreme
verge
For
all
beneath
the
moon
Would
I
not
leap
upright
Glou
Let
go
my
hand
Here
friend
is
another
purse

Well

Fairies

Prosper

Go

Bid

hear
thee
going
Edg
Now
fare
ye
well
good

Glou
With
all
my

Edg

Why
I
do
trifle
thus
with
his
despair
Is
done
to
cure
it
Glou
O
you
mighty
gods
He
kneels
This
world
I
do
renounce
and
in
your
sights
Shake
patiently
my
great
affliction
off
If
I
could
bear
it
longer
and
not
fall
To
quarrel
with
your
great
opposeless
wills
My
snuff
and
loathed
part
of
nature
should
Burn
itself
out
If
Edgar
live
O
bless
him
Now
fellow
fare
thee
well
He
falls
forward
and
swoons
Edg
Gone
sir
farewell
And
yet
I
know
not
how
conceit
may
rob
The
treasury
of
life
when
life
itself
Yields
to
the
theft
Had
he
been
where
he
thought
By
this
had
thought
been
past
Alive

dead
Ho
you
sir
friend
Hear
you
sir
Speak
Thus
might
he
pass
indeed
Yet
he
revives
What
are
you
sir
Glou
Away
and
let
me
die

Hadst
thou

but
gossamer
feathers

So
many
fadom
down

Thou

Hast

Ten
masts

the

Which
thou
hast
perpendicularly
fell
Thy
life
is
a
miracle
Speak
yet
again
Glou
But
have
I
fall
n

no
Edg
From
the
dread
summit
of
this
chalky
bourn
Look
up
a
height
The
shrill
gorg
d
lark
so
far
Cannot
be
seen
or

Do
but
look
up
Glou
Alack
I
have
no
eyes
Is
wretchedness
depriv
d
that
benefit
To
end
itself
by
death
Twas
yet
some
comfort
When
misery
could
beguile
the
tyrant
s
rage
And
frustrate
his
proud
will
Edg
Give
me
your
arm
Up
so
How
is

Feel
you

legs
You
stand
Glou
Too
well
too
well
Edg
This
is
above
all
strangeness
Upon
the
crown
o
th
cliff
what
thing
was
that
Which
parted
from
you
Glou
A
poor
unfortunate
beggar
Edg
As
I
stood
here

his
eyes
Were
two
full
moons

had
a
thousand
noses
Horns

Think

Of

Henceforth

Affliction

Enough

That
