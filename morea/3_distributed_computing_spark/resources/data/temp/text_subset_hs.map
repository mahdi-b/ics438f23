thine
That
saidst

O

One

TITUS
These
words
are
razors
to
my

heart
SATURNINUS
And
therefore
lovely
Tamora
Queen
of
Goths
That
like
the
stately
Phoebe
mongst

Dost
overshine

Behold
I

And
will
create

Emperess

Speak
Queen
of

dost
thou
applaud

And
here
I
swear
by
all
the
Roman
gods
Sith
priest
and
holy
water
are
so
near
And
tapers
burn
so
bright
and
everything
In

Or

And
here

If
Saturnine

She

A

Sent

conquered
There

rites
Exeunt

but
TITUS
TITUS
I
am
not
bid

Dishonoured

Re

LUCIUS
QUINTUS

MARTIUS
MARCUS
O
Titus
see
O
see
what
thou
hast
done
In
a
bad
quarrel
slain
a
virtuous
son
TITUS
No
foolish
Tribune
no
no
son
of
mine
Nor
thou
nor
these
confederates
in
the
deed
That
hath
dishonoured
all
our
family
Unworthy
brother
and
unworthy
sons
LUCIUS
But
let
us
give
him
burial
as
becomes
Give
Mutius
burial
with
our
bretheren
TITUS
Traitors
away
He
rests
not
in
this
tomb
This
monument
five
hundred
years
hath
stood
Which
I
have
sumptuously
re
edified
Here
none
but
soldiers
and
Rome
s
servitors
Repose
in
fame
none
basely
slain
in
brawls
Bury
him
where
you
can
he
comes
not
here
MARCUS
My
lord
this
is
impiety
in
you
My
nephew
Mutius
deeds
do
plead
for
him
He
must
be
buried
with
his
bretheren
QUINTUS
MARTIUS
And
shall
or
him
we
will
accompany
TITUS
And
shall
What
villain
was
it
spake
that
word
QUINTUS
He
that
would
vouch
it
in
any
place
but
here
TITUS
What
would
you
bury
him
in
my
despite
MARCUS
No
noble
Titus
but
entreat
of
thee
To
pardon
Mutius
and
to
bury
him
TITUS
Marcus
even
thou
hast
struck
upon
my
crest
And
with
these
boys
mine
honour
thou
hast
wounded
My
foes
I
do
repute
you
every
one
So
trouble
me
no
more
but
get
you
gone
MARTIUS
He
is
not
with
himself
let
us
withdraw
QUINTUS
Not
I
till
Mutius
bones
be
buried
The
BROTHER
and
the
SONS
kneel
MARCUS
Brother
for
in
that
name
doth
nature
plead
QUINTUS
Father
and
in
that
name
doth

speak
TITUS
Speak
thou
no
more
if
all
the
rest
will
speed
MARCUS
Renowned
Titus
more
than
half
my
soul
LUCIUS
Dear

MARCUS
Suffer
thy
brother
Marcus
to
inter
His
noble
nephew
here
in
virtue

nest
That
died
in
honour
and
Lavinia
s
cause
Thou
art
a
Roman
be
not
barbarous
The
Greeks
upon
advice
did
bury
Ajax
That
slew
himself
and
wise
Laertes
son
Did
graciously
plead
for
his
funerals
Let
not
young
Mutius
then
that
was
thy
joy
Be
barr
d
his
entrance
here
TITUS
Rise
Marcus
rise
The
dismal
st
day
is
this
that
e
er
I
saw
To
be
dishonoured
by
my
sons
in
Rome
Well
bury
him
and
bury
me
the
next
They
put
MUTIUS
in
the
tomb
LUCIUS
There
lie
thy
bones
sweet
Mutius
with
thy
friends
Till
we
with
trophies
do
adorn
thy
tomb
ALL
Kneeling
No
man

tears
for
noble
Mutius
He
lives
in

that
died
in

MARCUS
My
lord
to
step
out
of
these
dreary
dumps
How
comes
it
that
the
subtle
Queen
of
Goths
Is
of
a
sudden
thus
advanc

in
Rome
TITUS
I
know
not
Marcus
but
I
know
it
is
Whether
by
device
or
no
the
heavens
can
tell
Is
she
not
then
beholding
to
the
man
That
brought
her
for
this
high
good
turn
so
far
MARCUS
Yes
and
will
nobly
him
remunerate
Flourish
Re
enter
the
EMPEROR
TAMORA
and
her
two
SONS
with
the
MOOR
at
one
door
at
the
other
door
BASSIANUS
and
LAVINIA
with
others
SATURNINUS
So
Bassianus
you
have
play
d
your
prize
God
give
you
joy
sir
of
your
gallant
bride
BASSIANUS
And
you
of
yours
my
lord
I
say
no
more
Nor
wish
no
less
and
so
I
take
my
leave
SATURNINUS
Traitor
if
Rome
have
law
or
we
have
power
Thou
and
thy
faction
shall
repent
this
rape
BASSIANUS
Rape
call
you
it
my
lord
to
seize
my
own
My
true
betrothed
love
and
now
my
wife
But
let
the
laws
of
Rome
determine
all
Meanwhile
am
I
possess
d
of
that
is
mine
SATURNINUS
Tis
good
sir
You
are
very
short
with
us
But
if
we
live
we
ll
be
as
sharp
with
you
BASSIANUS
My
lord
what
I
have
done
as
best
I
may
Answer
I
must
and
shall
do
with
my
life
Only
thus
much
I
give
your
Grace
to
know
By
all
the
duties
that
I
owe
to
Rome
This
noble
gentleman
Lord
Titus
here
Is
in
opinion
and
in
honour
wrong
d
That
in
the
rescue
of
Lavinia
With
his
own
hand
did
slay
his
youngest
son
In
zeal
to
you
and
highly
mov
d
to
wrath
To
be
controll
d
in
that
he
frankly
gave
Receive
him
then
to
favour
Saturnine
That
hath
express
d
himself
in
all
his
deeds
A
father
and
a
friend
to
thee
and
Rome
TITUS
Prince
Bassianus
leave
to
plead
my
deeds
Tis
thou
and
those
that
have
dishonoured
me
Rome
and
the
righteous
heavens
be
my
judge
How
I
have
lov
d
and
honoured
Saturnine
TAMORA
My
worthy
lord
if
ever
Tamora
Were
gracious
in
those
princely
eyes
of
thine
Then
hear
me
speak
indifferently
for
all
And
at
my
suit
sweet
pardon
what
is
past
SATURNINUS
What
madam
be
dishonoured
openly
And
basely
put
it
up
without
revenge
TAMORA
Not
so
my
lord
the
gods
of
Rome
forfend
I
should
be
author
to
dishonour
you
But
on
mine
honour
dare
I
undertake
For
good
Lord
Titus
innocence
in
all
Whose
fury
not
dissembled
speaks
his
griefs
Then
at
my
suit
look
graciously
on
him
Lose
not
so
noble
a
friend
on
vain
suppose
Nor
with
sour
looks
afflict
his
gentle
heart
Aside
to
SATURNINUS
My
lord
be
rul
d
by
me
be
won
at
last
Dissemble
all
your
griefs
and
discontents
You
are
but
newly
planted
in
your
throne
Lest
then
the
people
and
patricians
too
Upon
a
just
survey
take
Titus
part
And
so
supplant
you
for
ingratitude
Which
Rome
reputes
to
be
a
heinous
sin
Yield
at
entreats
and
then
let
me
alone
I
ll
find
a
day
to
massacre
them
all
And
raze
their
faction
and
their
family
The
cruel
father
and
his
traitorous
sons
To
whom
I
sued
for
my
dear
son
s
life
And
make
them
know
what
tis
to
let
a
queen
Kneel
in
the
streets
and
beg
for
grace
in
vain
Come
come
sweet
Emperor
come
Andronicus
Take
up
this
good
old
man

cheer
the
heart
That
dies

Enter
AARON
AARON
Now
climbeth
Tamora
Olympus

Safe
out
of
Fortune
s
shot
and
sits
aloft
Secure
of
thunder
s
crack
or
lightning
flash
Advanc
d
above
pale
envy
s
threat
ning
reach
As
when
the
golden
sun
salutes
the
morn
And
having
gilt
the
ocean
with
his
beams
Gallops
the
zodiac
in
his
glistening
coach
And
overlooks
the
highest
peering
hills
So
Tamora
Upon
her
wit
doth
earthly
honour
wait
And
virtue
stoops
and
trembles
at
her
frown
Then
Aaron
arm
thy
heart
and
fit
thy
thoughts
To
mount
aloft
with
thy
imperial
mistress
And
mount
her
pitch
whom
thou
in
triumph
long
Hast
prisoner
held
fett
red
in
amorous
chains
And
faster
bound
to
Aaron
s
charming
eyes
Than
is
Prometheus
tied
to
Caucasus
Away
with
slavish
weeds
and
servile
thoughts
I
will
be
bright
and
shine
in
pearl
and
gold
To
wait
upon
this
new
made
emperess
To
wait

I
To
wanton
with
this
queen
This
goddess
this
Semiramis
this
nymph
This
siren
that
will
charm
Rome
s
Saturnine
And
see
his
shipwreck

Hullo
what
storm
is
this
Enter
CHIRON
and
DEMETRIUS
braving
DEMETRIUS
Chiron
thy

wants
wit
thy

wants

And

I
am

And
may
for
aught

CHIRON
Demetrius
thou
dost
over

And
so
in
this
to
bear
me
down
with
braves
Tis
not
the
difference
of
a
year
or
two
Makes
me
less
gracious
or
thee
more
fortunate
I
am
as
able
and
as
fit
as
thou
To
serve
and
to
deserve
my
mistress
grace
And
that
my
sword
upon
thee
shall
approve
And
plead
my

Why
boy
although

Gave
you

Are
you

Why
how

So
near

Emperor
s
palace
dare
ye
draw
And
maintain
such
a
quarrel
openly
Full
well
I
wot
the
ground
of
all
this
grudge
I
would
not

The

Nor
would

Be
so
dishonoured

Away

Now
by
the
gods

warlike
Goths

This
pretty
brabble
will
undo
us
all
Why
lords
and
think
you
not
how
dangerous
It
is
to
jet
upon
a
prince
s
right
What
is
Lavinia
then
become
so
loose
Or
Bassianus
so
degenerate
That
for
her
love
such
quarrels
may
be
broach

Without

Young

AARON
Why
are
ye
mad
or
know
ye
not
in
Rome
How
furious
and
impatient
they
be
And
cannot
brook
competitors
in

I
tell

you

plot

By

Than

easy
it
is
Of
a

to
steal

we
know
Though
Bassianus
be
the
Emperor
s
brother
Better
than
he
have
worn
Vulcan

AARON
Aside
Ay

as

Saturninus

DEMETRIUS
Then
why
should
he
despair
that

With

What

not
thou
full
often
struck
a
doe
And
borne

Would

ado
Why
hark

hark

and
are
you
such
fools
To
square
for

Would
it

That

Faith

Nor

AARON
For

Tis
policy
and
stratagem
must
do
That
you

so
must
you
resolve
That
what
you
cannot
as
you
would
achieve
You
must
perforce
accomplish
as
you
may
Take
this
of

Lucrece
was
not

chaste
Than
this
Lavinia
Bassianus
love
A
speedier
course
than
ling
ring
languishment
Must
we
pursue
and
I
have
found
the
path
My
lords
a
solemn
hunting
is
in
hand
There
will
the
lovely
Roman
ladies
troop
The
forest
walks
are
wide
and
spacious
And
many
unfrequented
plots
there
are
Fitted
by
kind
for
rape
and
villainy
Single
you
thither
then
this
dainty
doe
And
strike
her
home
by
force
if
not
by
words
This
way
or
not
at
all
stand
you
in
hope
Come
come
our
Empress
with
her
sacred
wit
To
villainy
and
vengeance
consecrate
Will
we
acquaint
with
all
what
we
intend
And
she
shall
file
our
engines
with
advice
That
will
not
suffer
you
to
square
yourselves
But
to
your
wishes
height
advance
you
both
The
Emperor
s
court
is
like
the
house
of
Fame
The
palace
full
of
tongues
of
eyes
and
ears
The
woods
are
ruthless
dreadful
deaf
and
dull
There
speak
and
strike
brave
boys
and
take
your
turns
There
serve
your
lust
shadowed
from
heaven
s
eye
And
revel
in
Lavinia
s
treasury
CHIRON
Thy

smells
of
no

ANDRONICUS
and
his
three
sons
LUCIUS
QUINTUS

making
a
noise
with
hounds
and
horns
and
MARCUS
TITUS
The
hunt
is
up
the
morn
is
bright
and
grey
The
fields
are
fragrant
and
the
woods
are
green
Uncouple
here
and
let
us
make
a
bay
And
wake
the
Emperor
and
his
lovely
bride
And
rouse
the
Prince
and
ring
a
hunter
s
peal
That
all
the
court
may
echo
with
the
noise
Sons
let
it
be
your
charge
as
it
is
ours
To
attend
the
Emperor
s
person
carefully
I
have
been
troubled
in
my
sleep
this
night
But
dawning
day
new
comfort
hath
inspir

Here
a
cry
of
hounds
and
wind

in
a
peal
Then
enter
SATURNINUS
TAMORA
BASSIANUS
LAVINIA
CHIRON
DEMETRIUS
and
their
attendants
Many
good
morrows
to
your
Majesty
Madam
to
you
as
many
and
as
good
I
promised
your
Grace
a
hunter

peal
SATURNINUS
And
you
have
rung
it
lustily
my
lords
Somewhat
too
early
for

BASSIANUS

LAVINIA
I
say
no
I
have
been
broad

Will
rouse
the
proudest
panther
in
the
chase
And
climb
the
highest
promontory
top
TITUS
And
I
have
horse
will
follow
where
the

Makes

like
swallows

Chiron

Exeunt
SCENE
III
A
lonely
part
of
the
forest
Enter
AARON
alone
with
a
bag
of
gold
AARON
He
that
had
wit
would
think
that
I
had
none
To
bury
so
much
gold
under
a
tree
And
never
after
to
inherit
it
Let
him
that
thinks
of
me
so
abjectly
Know
that
this
gold
must
coin
a
stratagem
Which
cunningly
effected
will
beget
A
very
excellent
piece
of
villainy
And
so
repose
sweet
gold
for
their
unrest
Hides
the
gold
That
have
their
alms
out
of
the
Empress
chest
Enter
TAMORA
alone
to
the
Moor
TAMORA
My
lovely
Aaron
wherefore
look
st
thou
sad
When
everything
does
make
a
gleeful
boast
The
birds
chant
melody
on
every
bush
The
snakes
lie
rolled
in
the
cheerful
sun
The
green
leaves
quiver
with
the
cooling
wind
And
make
a
chequer
d
shadow
on
the
ground
Under
their
sweet
shade
Aaron
let
us
sit
And
while
the
babbling
echo
mocks
the
hounds
Replying
shrilly
to
the
well
tun
d
horns
As
if
a
double
hunt
were
heard
at
once
Let
us
sit
down
and
mark
their
yellowing
noise
And
after
conflict
such
as
was
suppos
d
The
wand
ring
prince
and
Dido
once
enjoyed
When
with
a
happy
storm
they
were
surpris
d
And
curtain
d
with
a
counsel
keeping
cave
We
may
each
wreathed
in
the
other
s
arms
Our
pastimes
done
possess
a
golden
slumber
Whiles
hounds
and
horns
and
sweet
melodious
birds
Be
unto
us
as
is
a
nurse
s
song
Of
lullaby
to
bring
her
babe
asleep
AARON
Madam
though
Venus
govern
your
desires
Saturn
is
dominator
over
mine
What
signifies
my
deadly
standing
eye
My
silence
and
my
cloudy
melancholy
My
fleece
of
woolly
hair
that
now
uncurls
Even
as
an
adder
when
she
doth
unroll
To
do
some
fatal
execution
No
madam
these
are
no
venereal
signs
Vengeance
is
in
my
heart
death
in
my
hand
Blood
and
revenge
are
hammering
in
my
head
Hark
Tamora
the
empress
of
my
soul
Which
never
hopes
more
heaven
than
rests
in
thee
This
is
the
day
of
doom
for
Bassianus
His
Philomel
must
lose
her
tongue
to
day
Thy
sons
make
pillage
of
her
chastity
And
wash
their
hands
in
Bassianus
blood
