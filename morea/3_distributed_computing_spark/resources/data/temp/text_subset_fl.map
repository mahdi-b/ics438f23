Hang

I

not

the

these

Ay

If
he
should
intend
this

what

more
of

let
it
lie
on

I
do
not
misdoubt
my

Well

long
lov
d
her

I
protest
to
you
bestowed
much
on
her
followed
her
with
a
doting
observance
engross
d
opportunities
to
meet
her
fee
d
every
slight
occasion
that
could
but
niggardly
give
me
sight
of
her
not
only
bought
many
presents
to
give
her
but
have
given
largely
to
many
to
know
what
she
would
have
given
briefly
I
have
pursu
d
her
as
love
hath
pursued
me
which
hath
been
on
the
wing
of
all
occasions
But
whatsoever
I
have
merited
either
in
my
mind
or
in
my
means
meed
I
am
sure
I
have
received
none
unless
experience
be
a
jewel
that
I
have
purchased
at
an
infinite
rate
and
that
hath
taught
me
to
say
this
Love
like
a
shadow
flies
when
substance
love
pursues
Pursuing

that
flies

flying
what
pursues

that
I
have
lost
my
edifice

what
purpose
have
you
unfolded
this
to
me
FORD
When

enlargeth
her
mirth

far
that

shrewd
construction
made
of

FALSTAFF
O

Believe
it
for
you
know
it
There
is
money
spend
it
spend

spend
all
I
have
only
give
me
so
much
of

in

lay
an
amiable
siege
to
the
honesty
of
this
Ford

use
your

win
her
to
consent
to

FALSTAFF
Would
it
apply
well
to
the
vehemency

I
should
win
what

would
enjoy
Methinks
you
prescribe
to
yourself
very
preposterously
FORD
O
understand
my
drift
She
dwells
so
securely
on
the
excellency
of
her
honour
that
the
folly
of
my
soul
dares
not
present
itself
she
is
too
bright
to
be
look
d
against
Now
could
I
come
to
her
with
any
detection
in
my
hand
my
desires
had
instance
and
argument
to
commend
themselves
I
could
drive
her
then
from
the
ward
of
her
purity
her
reputation
her
marriage
vow
and
a
thousand
other
her
defences
which
now
are
too
too
strongly
embattl
d
against
me
What
