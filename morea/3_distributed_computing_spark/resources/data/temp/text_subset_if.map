CLOWN
Wit
an
t
be
thy
will
put
me
into
good
fooling
Those
wits
that
think
they
have
thee
do
very
oft
prove
fools
and
I
that
am
sure
I
lack
thee
may
pass
for
a
wise
man
For
what
says
Quinapalus
Better
a
witty
fool
than
a
foolish
wit
God
bless
thee
lady
OLIVIA
Take
the
fool
away
CLOWN
Do
you
not
hear
fellows
Take
away
the
lady
OLIVIA
Go
to
y
are
a
dry
fool
I
ll
no
more
of
you
Besides
you
grow
dishonest
CLOWN
Two
faults
madonna
that
drink
and
good
counsel
will
amend
for
give
the
dry
fool
drink
then
is
the
fool
not
dry
Bid
the
dishonest
man
mend
himself
if
he
mend
he
is
no
longer
dishonest
if
he
cannot
let
the
botcher
mend
him
Anything
that
s
mended
is
but
patch
d
virtue
that
transgresses
is
but
patch
d
with
sin
and
sin
that
amends
is
but
patch
d
with
virtue
If
that
this
simple
syllogism
will
serve
so
if
it
will
not
what
remedy
As
there
is
no
true
cuckold
but
calamity
so
beauty
s
a
flower
The
lady
bade
take
away
the
fool
therefore
I
say
again
take
her
away
OLIVIA
Sir
I
bade
them
take
away
you
CLOWN
Misprision
in
the
highest
degree
Lady
Cucullus
non
facit
monachum
that
s
as
much
to
say
as
I
wear
not
motley
in
my
brain
Good

me
leave
to
prove
you
a
fool
OLIVIA
Can

CLOWN
Dexteriously

OLIVIA
Good

death
CLOWN

hell
madonna
OLIVIA
I
know
his
soul
is
in
heaven
fool
CLOWN
The
more
fool
madonna
to
mourn
for
your
brother
s
soul
being
in
heaven
Take
away
the
fool
gentlemen
OLIVIA
What
think

of
this
fool
Malvolio
Doth

MALVOLIO
Yes

shall
do
till
the
pangs
of
death
shake
him
Infirmity
that
decays
the
wise
doth
ever
make
the
better
fool
CLOWN
God
send
you
sir
a
speedy
infirmity
for
the
better
increasing
your
folly
Sir
Toby
will
be
sworn
that
I
am
no
fox
but
he
will
not
pass
his
word
for
twopence
that
you

no
fool
OLIVIA
How
say
you
to
that
Malvolio
MALVOLIO
I
marvel
your
ladyship
takes
delight
in
such
a
barren
rascal
I
saw
him
put
down
the
other
day
with
an
ordinary
fool
that
has
no
more
brain
than
a
stone
Look
you
now
he
s
out
of
his
guard
already
unless
you
laugh
and
minister
occasion
to
him
he
is
gagg

I
protest
I
take
these
wise
men
that
crow
so
at
these
set
kind
of
fools
no
better
than
the
fools
zanies
OLIVIA
O
you
are
sick
of
self
love
Malvolio
and
taste
with
a
distemper
d
appetite
To
be
generous
guiltless
and
of
free
disposition
is
to
take
those
things
for
bird
bolts
that
you
deem
cannon
bullets
There
is
no
slander
in
an
allow
d
fool
though
he
do
nothing
but
rail
nor
no
railing
in
known
discreet
man
though
he
do

I
told

What

He

OLIVIA
Tell

MALVOLIO
Has

told
so

Of

ill
manner
he

OLIVIA
Of
what
personage
and
years
is
he
MALVOLIO
Not
yet
old
enough
for
a
man
nor
young
enough
for
a
boy
as
a
squash

tis
a
peascod
or
a
codling
when
tis
almost
an
apple
tis
with
him
in
standing
water
between
boy
and
man
He
is
very
well

very
shrewishly
one

OLIVIA
Speak

me
I
shall
answer
for
her
Your
will
VIOLA
Most
radiant
exquisite
and
unmatchable
beauty
I
pray
you
tell
me
if
this
be
the
lady
of
the
house
for
I
never
saw
her
I
would
be
loath
to
cast
away
my
speech
for
besides
that
it
is
excellently
well
penn
d
I
have
taken
great
pains
to
con
it
Good
beauties
let
me
sustain
no
scorn
I
am
very
comptible
even
to
the
least
sinister
usage
OLIVIA
Whence
came
you
sir
VIOLA
I
can
say
little
more
than
I
have
studied
and
that
question
s
out
of
my
part
Good
gentle
one
give
me
modest
assurance
if
you
be
the
lady
of
the
house
that
I
may
proceed
in
my
speech
OLIVIA
Are
you
a
comedian
VIOLA
No
my
profound
heart
and
yet
by
the
very
fangs
of
malice
I
swear
I
am
not
that
I
play
Are
you
the
lady
of
the
house
OLIVIA
If
I
do
not
usurp
myself
I
am
VIOLA
Most
certain
if
you
are
she
you
do
usurp
yourself
for
what
is
yours
to
bestow
is
not
yours
to
reserve
But
this
is
from
my
commission
I
will
on
with
my
speech
in
your
praise
and
then
show
you
the
heart
of
my
message
OLIVIA
Come
to
what
is
important
in
t
I
forgive
you
the
praise
VIOLA
Alas
I
took
great
pains
to
study
it
and
tis
poetical
OLIVIA
It
is
the
more
like
to
be
feigned
I
pray
you
keep
it
in
I
heard
you
were
saucy
at
my
gates
and
allow
d
your
approach
rather
to
wonder
at
you
than
to
hear
you
If
you
be
not
mad
be
gone
if
you
have
reason
be
brief
tis
not
that
time
of
moon
with
me
to
make
one
in
so
skipping
dialogue
MARIA
Will
you
hoist
sail
sir
Here
lies
your
way
VIOLA
No
good
swabber
I
am
to
hull
here
a
little
longer
Some
mollification
for
your
giant
sweet
lady
OLIVIA
Tell
me
your
mind
VIOLA
I
am
a
messenger
OLIVIA
Sure
you
have
some
hideous
matter
to
deliver
when
the
courtesy
of
it
is
so
fearful
Speak
your
office
VIOLA
It
alone
concerns
your
ear
I
bring
no
overture
of
war
no
taxation
of
homage
I
hold
the
olive
in
my
hand
my
words
are
as
full
of
peace
as
matter
OLIVIA
Yet
you
began
rudely
What
are
you
What
would
you
VIOLA
The
rudeness
that
hath
appear
d
in
me
have
I
learn
d
from
my
entertainment
What
I
am
and
what
I
would
are
as
secret
as
maidenhead
to
your
cars
divinity
to
any
other
s
profanation
OLIVIA
Give
us
the
place
alone
we
will
hear
this
divinity
Exeunt
MARIA
and
ATTENDANTS
Now
sir
what
is
your
text
VIOLA
Most
sweet
lady
OLIVIA
A
comfortable
doctrine
and
much
may
be
said
of
it
Where
lies
your
text
VIOLA
In
Orsino
s
bosom
OLIVIA
In
his
bosom
In
what
chapter
of
his
bosom
VIOLA
To
answer
by
the
method
in
the
first
of
his
heart
OLIVIA
O
I
have
read
it
it
is
heresy
Have
you
no
more
to
say
VIOLA
Good
madam
let
me
see
your
face
OLIVIA
Have
you
any
commission
from
your
lord
to
negotiate
with
my
face
You

out
of
your
text
but
we
will
draw
the
curtain
and
show
you
the
picture
Unveiling
Look

a
one
I

If
you

these
graces
to
the
grave
And

OLIVIA
O

I
will
not
be
so
hard
hearted
I
will
give

of
my

Were

VIOLA
I

too
proud
But

My

love
Could

The

OLIVIA
How
does
he
love
me
VIOLA
With
adorations
fertile
tears
With
groans
that
thunder
love
with
sighs
of
fire
OLIVIA
Your
lord
does
know
my
mind
I
cannot
love
him
Yet
I
suppose
him
virtuous

him
noble
Of

and
stainless
youth
In

And
in

A
gracious

He
might
have
took
his
answer
long
ago
VIOLA
If
I
did
love
you
in
my
master

flame
With
such
a
suff
ring
such
a
deadly
life
In
your
denial
I
would
find
no
sense
I
would
not
understand
it
OLIVIA
Why
what
would
you
VIOLA
Make
me
a
willow
cabin
at
your
gate
And
call
upon
my
soul
within
the
house
Write
loyal
cantons
of
contemned
love
And
sing
them
loud
even
in
the
dead
of
night
Halloo
your
name
to
the
reverberate
hals
And
make
the
babbling
gossip
of
the
air
Cry
out
Olivia
O
you
should
not
rest
Between
the
elements
of
air
and
earth
But
you
should

Get

SCENE
I
The

coast
Enter
ANTONIO
and
SEBASTIAN
ANTONIO
Will
you
stay
no
longer
nor
will
you
not
that
I
go
with
you
SEBASTIAN
By
your
patience
no
My
stars
shine
darkly
over
me
the
malignancy
of
my
fate
might
perhaps
distemper
yours
therefore
I
shall
crave
of
you
your
leave
that
I
may
bear
my
evils
alone
It
were
a
bad
recompense
for
your
love
to
lay
any
of
them
on
you
ANTONIO
Let
me
know
of
you
whither
you
are
bound
SEBASTIAN
No
sooth
sir
my
determinate
voyage
is
mere
extravagancy
But
I
perceive
in
you
so
excellent
a
touch
of
modesty
that
you
will
not
extort
from
me
what
I
am
willing
to
keep
in
therefore
it
charges
me
in
manners
the
rather
to
express
myself
You
must
know
of
me
then
Antonio
my
name
is
Sebastian
which
I
call
d
Roderigo
my
father
was
that
Sebastian
of
Messaline
whom
I
know
you

Invites
