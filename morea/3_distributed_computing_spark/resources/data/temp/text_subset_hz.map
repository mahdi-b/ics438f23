The

To

Let

Since

about
this

Every

Hath

If

To

Had

The

TROILUS
Fie
fie
my

Weigh
you
the
worth
and
honour
of
a
king
So
great
as
our
dread
father
s
in
a
scale
Of
common
ounces
Will
you
with
counters
sum
The
past
proportion
of
his
infinite
And
buckle
in
a
waist
most
fathomless
With
spans
and
inches
so
diminutive
As
fears

Fie
for
godly
shame
HELENUS
No
marvel
though
you
bite
so
sharp
at
reasons
You
are
so
empty
of
them
Should
not
our
father
Bear
the
great
sway
of
his
affairs
with
reasons
Because
your
speech
hath
none

tells
him
so
TROILUS
You

brother
priest
You

Here

You

an

You

perilous
And
reason
flies
the
object
of
all
harm
Who
marvels
then
when
Helenus
beholds
A
Grecian
and
his
sword
if
he
do
set
The
very
wings
of
reason
to
his
heels
And
fly
like
chidden
Mercury
from
Jove
Or
like

Nay
if
we
talk

Let

shut

Manhood

Should

With

Reason

Make

HECTOR
Brother
she

doth
cost
The

TROILUS
What

aught

HECTOR
But
value
dwells
not
in
particular
will
It
holds
his
estimate
and
dignity
As
well
wherein
tis
precious
of
itself
As
in
the
prizer
Tis
mad
idolatry
To
make
the

greater

And

To

Without

TROILUS
I

Is

My

enkindled

Two

twixt
the

shores
Of

and
judgment
how

Although

The

There
can

To

When

We

Because

It

Paris
should
do
some
vengeance
on
the
Greeks
Your

with
full

benied

The

And

And
for

the
Greeks
held
captive
He
brought
a
Grecian
queen
whose
youth

Wrinkles
Apollo

Why
keep
we
her
The

Is

Why
she
is

Whose

HECTOR
Now
youthful
Troilus
do
not
these
high
strains
Of
divination

Some
touches

is
your

So
madly
hot
that
no
discourse
of

Nor
fear
of

success
in
a

Can
qualify

TROILUS
Why
brother
Hector
We
may
not
think
the
justness
of
each
act
Such
and
no
other
than
event
doth
form
it
Nor
once
deject
the
courage
of
our
minds
Because
Cassandra

mad
Her
brain
sick
raptures
Cannot
distaste
the
goodness
of
a
quarrel
Which
hath
our

honours
all
engag

To
make
it
gracious
For
my
private
part
I
am
no
more
touch

all
Priam

sons
And
Jove
forbid
there
should
be
done
amongst

Such
things
as
might
offend
the

spleen
To
fight
for
and
maintain
PARIS
Else
might
the
world
convince
of
levity
As
well
my
undertakings
as
your
counsels
But
I
attest
the
gods
your
full
consent
Gave
wings
to
my
propension
and
cut
of
All
fears
attending
on
so
dire
a
project
For
what
alas
can
these
my
single
arms
What
propugnation
is
in
one
man
s
valour
To
stand
the
push
and
enmity
of
those
This
quarrel
would
excite
Yet
I
protest
Were
I
alone
to
pass
the
difficulties
And
had
as
ample
power
as
I
have
will
Paris
should
ne
er
retract
what
he
hath
done
Nor
faint
in
the
pursuit
PRIAM
Paris
you
speak
Like
one
besotted
on
your
sweet
delights
You
have
the
honey
still
but
these
the
gall
So
to
be
valiant
is
no
praise
at
all
PARIS
Sir
I
propose
not
merely
to
myself
The
pleasures
such
a
beauty
brings
with
it
But
I
would
have
the
soil
of
her
fair
rape
Wip
d
off
in
honourable
keeping
her
What
treason
were
it
to
the
ransack
d
queen
Disgrace
to
your
great
worths
and
shame
to
me
Now
to
deliver
her
possession
up
On
terms
of
base
compulsion
Can
it
be
That
so
degenerate
a
strain
as
this
Should
once
set
footing
in
your
generous
bosoms
There
s
not
the
meanest
spirit
on
our
party
Without
a
heart
to
dare
or
sword
to
draw
When
Helen
is
defended
nor
none
so
noble
Whose
life
were
ill
bestow
d
or
death
unfam
d
Where
Helen
is
the
subject
Then
I
say
Well
may
we
fight
for
her
whom
we
know
well
The
world
s
large
spaces
cannot
parallel
HECTOR
Paris
and
Troilus
you
have
both
said
well
And
on
the
cause
and
question
now
in
hand
Have
gloz
d
but
superficially
not
much
Unlike
young
men
whom
Aristode
thought
Unfit
to
hear
moral
philosophy
The
reasons
you
allege
do
more
conduce
To
the
hot
passion
of
distemp
red
blood
Than
to
make
up
a
free
determination
Twixt
right
and
wrong
for
pleasure
and
revenge
Have
ears
more
deaf
than
adders
to
the
voice
Of
any
true
decision
Nature
craves
All
dues
be
rend
red
to
their
owners
Now
What
nearer
debt
in
all
humanity
Than
wife
is
to
the
husband
If
this
law
Of
nature
be
corrupted
through
affection
And
that
great
minds
of
partial
indulgence
To
their
benumbed
wills
resist
the
same
There
is
a
law
in
each
well
order
d
nation
To
curb
those
raging
appetites
that
are
Most
disobedient
and
refractory
If
Helen
then
be
wife
to
Sparta
s
king
As
it
is
known
she
is
these
moral
laws
Of
nature
and
of
nations
speak
aloud
To
have
her
back
return
d
Thus
to
persist
In
doing
wrong
extenuates
not
wrong
But
makes
it
much
more
heavy
Hector
s
opinion
Is
this
in
way
of
truth
Yet
ne
er
the
less
My
spritely
brethren
I
propend
to
you
In
resolution
to
keep
Helen
still
For
tis
a
cause
that
hath
no
mean
dependence
Upon
our
joint
and
several
dignities
TROILUS
Why
there
you
touch
d
the
life
of
our
design
Were
it
not
glory
that
we
more
affected
Than
the
performance
of
our
heaving
spleens
I
would
not
wish
a
drop
of
Troyan
blood
Spent
more
in
her
defence
But
worthy
Hector
She
is
a
theme
of
honour
and
renown
A
spur
to
valiant
and
magnanimous
deeds
Whose
present
courage
may
beat
down
our
foes
And
fame
in
time
to
come
canonize
us
For
I
presume
brave
Hector
would
not
lose
So
rich
advantage
of
a
promis
d
glory
As
smiles
upon
the
forehead
of
this
action
For
the
wide
world
s
revenue
HECTOR
I
am
yours
You
valiant
offspring
of
great
Priamus
I
have
a
roisting
challenge
sent
amongst
The
dull
and
factious
nobles
of
the
Greeks
Will
strike
amazement
to
their
drowsy
spirits
I

their
great

Whilst
emulation

THERSITES
How

Thersites
What
lost

the
labyrinth
of
thy
fury
Shall
the
elephant
Ajax
carry
it
thus
He
beats
me
and
I
rail
at
him
O
worthy
satisfaction
Would
it
were
otherwise
that
I
could
beat
him
whilst
he
rail

at
me
Sfoot
I
ll
learn
to
conjure
and
raise
devils
but
I

see
some
issue
of
my
spiteful
execrations
Then
there

Achilles
a
rare
engineer
If
Troy
be
not
taken
till
these
two
undermine
it
the
walls
will
stand
till
they
fall
of
themselves
O
thou
great
thunder
darter
of
Olympus
forget
that
thou
art
Jove
the
king
of
gods
and
Mercury
lose
all
the
serpentine
craft
of
thy
caduceus
if
ye
take
not
that
little
little
less
than
little
wit
from
them
that
they

short
arm
d
ignorance

scarce
it
will
not
in
circumvention
deliver
a
fly
from
a
spider
without
drawing
their
massy
irons
and
cutting
the
web
After

vengeance

the
Neapolitan

that
methinks
is
the
curse
depending

If

Heaven

Agamemnon

Achilles
Achilles

Thersites

Why

ACHILLES
Come
Patroclus
I

Come
in

Thersites
Exit
THERSITES
Here
is
such
patchery
such
juggling
and
such
knavery
All
the
argument
is
a
whore

a
cuckold
a

quarrel
to
draw
emulous

that
we

He
shent
our

and
we
lay
by
Our

Let

be

We
dare
not

Or
know

PATROCLUS
I
shall
say
so

We

him
at
the
opening

He
is
not
sick

Yes
lion
sick
sick
of
proud
heart
You
may
call
it
melancholy
if
you
will
favour

but
by
my
head
tis
pride
But
why
why
Let

show

a
cause
A

Takes
AGAMEMNON
aside
NESTOR
What

Ajax

ULYSSES
Achilles
hath

No

that

his

Achilles
NESTOR
All
the
better
their
fraction
is
more
our
wish

But
it
was

could
disunite

The
amity

may
easily
untie
Re

PATROCLUS
Here

Patroclus
NESTOR
No
Achilles
with
him
ULYSSES
The
elephant
hath
joints
but
none
for
courtesy
his
legs
are
legs
for
necessity

for
flexure
PATROCLUS
Achilles
bids
me
say
he
is
much
sorry
If
any
thing
more
than
your
sport
and
pleasure
Did
move
your
greatness
and
this
noble
state
To
call
upon
him
he
hopes
it
is
no
other
But
for
your
health
and
your
digestion
sake
An
after
dinner
s
breath
AGAMEMNON
Hear
you
Patroclus
We
are
too
well
acquainted
with
these
answers
But
his
evasion
wing
d
thus
swift
with
scorn
Cannot
outfly
our
apprehensions
Much
attribute
he
hath
and
much
the
reason
Why
we
ascribe
it
to
him
Yet
all
his
virtues
Not
virtuously
on
his
own
part
beheld
Do
in
our
eyes
begin
to
lose
their
gloss
Yea
like
fair
