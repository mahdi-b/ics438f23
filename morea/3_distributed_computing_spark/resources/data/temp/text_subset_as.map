And
show
me
to
the
shouting
varletry
Of
censuring
Rome
Rather
a
ditch
in
Egypt
Be
gentle
grave
unto
me
Rather
on
Nilus
mud
Lay
me
stark
nak
d
and
let
the
water
flies
Blow
me
into
abhorring
Rather
make
My
country
s
high
pyramides
my
gibbet
And
hang
me
up
in
chains
PROCULEIUS
You
do
extend
These
thoughts
of
horror
further
than
you
shall
Find
cause
in
Caesar
Enter
DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA
Proculeius
What
thou
hast
done
thy
master
Caesar
knows
And
he
hath
sent
for
thee
For
the
Queen
I
ll
take
her
to
my
guard
PROCULEIUS
So
Dolabella
It
shall
content
me
best
Be
gentle
to
her
To
CLEOPATRA
To
Caesar
I
will
speak
what
you
shall
please
If
you
ll
employ
me
to
him
CLEOPATRA
Say
I
would
die
Exeunt
PROCULEIUS
and
soldiers
DOLABELLA
Most
noble
Empress
you
have
heard
of
me
CLEOPATRA
I
cannot
tell
DOLABELLA
Assuredly
you
know
me
CLEOPATRA
No
matter
sir
what
I
have
heard
or
known
You
laugh
when
boys
or
women
tell
their
dreams
Is
t
not
your
trick
DOLABELLA
I
understand
not
madam
CLEOPATRA
I
dreamt
there
was
an
Emperor
Antony
O
such
another
sleep
that
I
might
see
But
such
another
man
DOLABELLA
If
it
might
please
ye
CLEOPATRA
His
face
was
as
the
heav
ns
and
therein
stuck
A
sun
and
moon
which
kept
their
course
and
lighted
The
little
O
the
earth
DOLABELLA
Most
sovereign
creature
CLEOPATRA
His
legs
bestrid
the
ocean
his
rear
d
arm
Crested
the
world
His
voice
was
propertied
As
all
the
tuned
spheres
and
that
to
friends
But
when
he
meant
to
quail
and
shake
the
orb
He
was
as
rattling
thunder
For
his
bounty
There
was
no
winter
in
t
an
autumn
twas
That
grew
the
more
by
reaping
His
delights
Were
dolphin
like
they
show
d
his
back
above
The
element
they
liv
d
in
In
his
livery
Walk
d
crowns
and
crownets
realms
and
islands
were
As
plates
dropp
d
from
his
pocket
DOLABELLA
Cleopatra
CLEOPATRA
Think
you
there
was
or
might
be
such
a
man
As
this
I
dreamt
of
DOLABELLA
Gentle
madam
no
CLEOPATRA
You
lie
up
to
the
hearing
of
the
gods
But
if
there
be
nor
ever
were
one
such
It
s
past
the
size
of
drearning
Nature
wants
stuff
To
vie
strange
forms
with
fancy
yet
t
imagine
An
Antony
were
nature
s
piece
gainst
fancy
Condemning
shadows
quite
DOLABELLA
Hear
me
good
madam
Your
loss
is
as
yourself
great
and
you
bear
it
As
answering
to
the
weight
Would
I
might
never
O
ertake
pursu
d
success
but
I
do
feel
By
the
rebound
of
yours
a
grief
that
smites
My
very
heart
at
root
CLEOPATRA
I
thank
you
sir
Know
you
what
Caesar
means
to
do
with
me
DOLABELLA
I
am
loath
to
tell
you
what
I
would
you
knew
CLEOPATRA
Nay
pray
you
sir
DOLABELLA
Though
he
be
honourable
CLEOPATRA
He
ll
lead
me
then
in
triumph
DOLABELLA
Madam
he
will
I
know

Flourish
Within
Make

Arise

CLEOPATRA
Sir
the
gods
Will
have
it
thus
my
master
and
my
lord
I
must
obey
CAESAR
Take
to
you
no
hard
thoughts
The
record
of
what
injuries
you
did
us
Though
written
in
our
flesh
we
shall
remember
As
things
but
done
by
chance
CLEOPATRA
Sole
sir
o
th
world
I
cannot
project
mine
own
cause
so
well
To
make
it
clear
but
do
confess
I
have
Been
laden
with
like
frailties
which
before
Have
often
sham
d
our
sex
CAESAR
Cleopatra
know
We
will
extenuate
rather
than
enforce
If
you
apply
yourself
to
our
intents
Which
towards
you
are
most
gentle
you
shall
find
A
benefit
in
this
change
but
if
you
seek
To
lay
on
me
a
cruelty
by
taking
Antony
s
course
you
shall
bereave
yourself
Of
my
good
purposes
and
put
your
children
To
that
destruction
which
I
ll
guard
them
from
If
thereon
you
rely
I
ll
take
my
leave
CLEOPATRA
And
may
through
all
the
world
Tis
yours
and
we
Your
scutcheons
and
your
signs
of
conquest
shall
Hang
in
what
place
you
please
Here
my
good
lord
CAESAR
You
shall
advise
me
in
all
for
Cleopatra
CLEOPATRA
This
is
the
brief
of
money
plate
and
jewels
I
am
possess
d
of
Tis
exactly
valued
Not
petty
things
admitted
Where

Seleucus
SELEUCUS
Here
madam
CLEOPATRA
This
is
my
treasurer
let
him
speak
my
lord
Upon
his
peril
that
I
have
reserv
d
To
myself
nothing
Speak
the
truth
Seleucus
SELEUCUS
Madam
I
had
rather
seal
my
lips
than
to
my
peril
Speak
that
which
is
not
CLEOPATRA
What
have
I
kept
back
SELEUCUS
Enough
to
purchase
what
you
have
made
known
CAESAR
Nay
blush
not
Cleopatra
I
approve
Your
wisdom
in
the
deed
CLEOPATRA
See
Caesar
O
behold
How
pomp
is
followed
Mine
will
now
be
yours
And
should
we
shift
estates
yours
would
be
mine
The
ingratitude
of
this
Seleucus
does
Even
make
me
wild
O
slave
of
no
more
trust
Than
love
that
s
hir
d
What
goest
thou
back
Thou
shalt
Go
back
I
warrant
thee
but
I
ll
catch
thine
eyes
Though
they
had
wings
Slave
soulless
villain
dog
O
rarely
base
CAESAR
Good
Queen
let
us
entreat
you
CLEOPATRA
O
Caesar
what
a
wounding
shame
is
this
That
thou
vouchsafing
here
to
visit
me
Doing
the
honour
of
thy
lordliness
To
one
so
meek
that
mine
own
servant
should
Parcel
the
sum
of
my
disgraces
by
Addition
of
his
envy
Say
good
Caesar
That
I
some
lady
trifles
have
reserv
d
Immoment
toys
things
of
such
dignity
As
we
greet
modern
friends
withal
and
say
Some
nobler
token
I
have
kept
apart
For
Livia
and
Octavia
to
induce
Their
mediation
must
I
be
unfolded
With
one
that
I
have
bred
The
gods
It
smites
me
Beneath
the
fall
I
have
To
SELEUCUS
Prithee
go
hence
Or
I
shall
show
the
cinders
of
my
spirits
Through
th
ashes
of
my
chance
Wert
thou
a
man
Thou
wouldst
have
mercy
on
me
CAESAR
Forbear
Seleucus
Exit
SELEUCUS
CLEOPATRA
Be
it
known
that
we
the
greatest
are
misthought
For
things
that
others
do
and
when
we
fall
We
answer
others
merits
in
our
name
Are
therefore
to
be
pitied
CAESAR
Cleopatra
Not
what
you

nor
what
acknowledg
d
Put

i
th
roll
of

Still

t
yours
Bestow
it
at
your
pleasure
and
believe
Caesar
s
no
merchant
to
make
prize
with
you
Of
things
that
merchants
sold
Therefore

Make
not

No

For
we

to

you
as
Yourself

Feed

To

Their

Exit

A
noise

Wherefore
s
this
noise
Enter
a
GUARDSMAN
GUARDSMAN
Here
is
a
rural
fellow
That
will
not
be
denied
your
Highness
presence
He
brings
you
figs
CLEOPATRA
Let
him
come
in
Exit
GUARDSMAN
What
poor
an
instrument
May
do
a
noble
deed
He
brings
me
liberty
My
resolution
s
plac
d
and
I
have
nothing
Of
woman
in
me
Now
from
head
to
foot
I
am
marble
constant
now
the
fleeting
moon
No
planet
is
of

Re
enter
GUARDSMAN
and
CLOWN
with
a
basket
GUARDSMAN
This
is
the
man
CLEOPATRA
Avoid
and
leave
him
Exit
GUARDSMAN
Hast
thou
the
pretty
worm
of
Nilus
there
That
kills
and
pains
not
CLOWN
Truly
I
have
him
But
I
would
not
be
the
party
that
should
desire
you
to
touch
him
for
his
biting
is
immortal
those
that
do
die
of
it
do
seldom
or
never
recover
CLEOPATRA
Remember
st
thou
any
that
have
died
on
t
CLOWN
Very
many
men
and
women
too
I
heard
of
one
of
them
no
longer
than
yesterday
a
very
honest
woman
but
something
given
to
lie
as
a
woman
should
not
do
but
in
the
way
of
honesty
how
she
died
of
the
biting
of
it
what
pain
she
felt
truly
she
makes
a
very
good
report
o
th
worm
But
he
that
will
believe
all
that
they
say
shall
never
be
saved
by
half
that
they
do
But
this
is
most
falliable
the
worm
s
an
odd
worm
CLEOPATRA
Get
thee
hence
farewell
CLOWN
I
wish
you
all
joy
of
the
worm
Sets
down
the
basket
CLEOPATRA
Farewell
CLOWN
You
must
think
this
look
you
that
the
worm
will
do
his
kind
CLEOPATRA
Ay
ay
farewell
CLOWN
Look
you
the
worm
is
not
to
be
trusted
but
in
the
keeping
of
wise
people
for
indeed
there
is
no
goodness
in
the
worm
CLEOPATRA
Take
thou
no
care
it
shall
be
heeded
CLOWN
Very
good
Give
it
nothing
I
pray
you
for
it
is
not
worth
the
feeding
CLEOPATRA
Will
it
eat
me
CLOWN
You
must
not
think
I
am
so
simple
but
I
know
the
devil
himself
will
not
eat
a
woman
I
know
that
a
woman
is
a
dish
for
the
gods
if
the
devil
dress
her
not
But
truly
these
same
whoreson
devils
do
the
gods
great
harm
in
their
women
for
in
every
ten
that
they
make
the
devils
mar
five
CLEOPATRA
Well
get
thee
gone
farewell
CLOWN
Yes
forsooth
I
wish
you
joy
o
th
worm
Exit
Re
enter
IRAS
with
a
robe

c
CLEOPATRA
Give
me
my
robe
put
on
my
crown
I
have
Immortal
longings
in
me
Now
no
more
The
juice
of
Egypt

Yare
yare

Iras
quick
Methinks
I
hear
Antony
call
I
see
him
rouse
himself
To
praise
my
noble
act
I
hear
him
mock
The
luck
of
Caesar
which
the
gods
give
men
To
excuse
their
after
wrath
Husband
I
come
Now
to
that
name
my

my

I

the

Dost

If
thus
thou

can
so
gently
part
The
stroke
of

is
as

Which
hurts

Dost

If

It

CHARMIAN
Dissolve
thick
cloud
and
rain
that
I
may
say
The
gods
themselves
do
weep
CLEOPATRA
This
proves
me
base
If
she
first
meet
the
curled
Antony
He
ll
make
demand
of
her
and
spend
that
kiss
Which
is
my
heaven
to

Come
thou
mortal

To

to

With

Of

Poor

Be

SCENE
I
Orchard
of
OLIVER
S
house
Enter
ORLANDO
and
ADAM
ORLANDO
As
I
remember
Adam
it
was
upon
this
fashion
bequeathed
me
by
will
but
poor
a
thousand
crowns
and
as
thou
say
st
charged
my
brother
on
his
blessing
to
breed
me
well
and
there
begins
my
sadness
My
brother
Jaques
he
keeps
at
school
and
report
speaks
goldenly
of
his
profit
For
my
part
he
keeps
me
rustically
at
home
or
to
speak
more
properly
stays
me
here
at
home
unkept
for
call
you
that
keeping
for
a
gentleman
of
my
birth
that
differs
not
from
the
stalling
of
an
ox
His
horses
are
bred
better
for
besides
that
they
are
fair
with
their
feeding
they
are
taught
their
manage
and
to
that
end
riders
dearly
hir
d
but
I
his
brother
gain
nothing
under
him
but
growth
for
the
which
his
animals
on
his
dunghills
are
as
much
bound
to
him
as
I
Besides
this
nothing
that
he
so
plentifully
gives
me
the
something
that
nature
gave
me
his
countenance
seems
to
take
from
me
He
lets
me
feed
with
his
hinds
bars
me
the
place
of
a
brother
and
as
much
as
in
him
lies
mines
my
gentility
with
my
education
This
is
it
Adam
that
grieves
me
and
the
spirit
of
my
father
which
I
think
is
within
me
begins
to
mutiny
against
this
servitude
I
will
no
longer
endure
it
though
yet
I
know
no
wise
remedy
how
to
avoid
it
Enter
OLIVER
ADAM
Yonder
comes
my
master
your
brother
ORLANDO
Go
apart
Adam
and
thou
shalt
hear
how
he
will
shake
me
up
ADAM
retires
OLIVER
Now
sir
what
make
you
here
ORLANDO
Nothing
I
am
not
taught
to
make
any
thing
OLIVER
What
mar
you
then
sir
ORLANDO
Marry
sir
I
am
helping
you
to
mar
that
which
God
made
a
poor
unworthy
brother
of
yours
with
idleness
OLIVER
Marry
sir
be
better
employed
and
be
nought
awhile
ORLANDO
Shall
I
keep
your
hogs
and
eat
husks
with
them
What
prodigal
portion
have
I
spent
that
I
should
come
to
such
penury
OLIVER
Know
you
where
you
are
sir
ORLANDO
O
sir
very
well
here
in
your
orchard
OLIVER
Know
you
before
whom
sir
ORLANDO
Ay
better
than
him
I
am
before
knows
me
I
know
you
are
my
eldest
brother
and
in
the
gentle
condition
of
blood
you
should
so
know
me
The
courtesy
of
nations
allows
you
my
better
in
that
you
are
the
first
born
but
the
same
tradition
takes
not
away
my
blood
were
there
twenty
brothers
betwixt
us
I
have
as
much
of
my
father
in
me
as
you
albeit
I
confess
your
coming
before
me
is
nearer
to
his
reverence
OLIVER
What
boy
Strikes
him
ORLANDO
Come
come
elder
brother
you
are
too
young
in
this
OLIVER
Wilt
thou
lay
hands
on
me
villain
ORLANDO
I
am
no
villain
I
am
the
youngest
son
of
Sir
Rowland
de
Boys
He
was
my
father
and
he
is
thrice
a
villain
that
says
such
a
father
begot
villains
Wert
thou
not
my
brother
I
would
not
take
this
hand
from
thy
throat
till
this
other
had
pull
d
out
thy
tongue
for
saying
so
Thou
has
rail
d
on
thyself
ADAM
Coming
forward
Sweet
masters
be
patient
for
your
father
s
remembrance
be
at
accord
OLIVER
Let
me
go
I
say
ORLANDO
I
will
not
till
I
please
you
shall
hear
me
My
father
charg
d
you
in
his
will
to
give
me
good
education
you
have
train
d
me
like
a
peasant
obscuring
and
hiding
from
me
all
gentleman
like
qualities
The
spirit
of
my
father
grows
strong
in
me
and
I
will
no
longer
endure
it
therefore
allow
me
such
exercises
as
may
become
a
gentleman
or
give
me
the
poor
allottery
my
father
left
me
by
testament
with
that
I
will
go
buy
my
fortunes
OLIVER
And
what
wilt
thou
do
Beg
when
that
is
spent
Well
sir
get
you
in
I
will
not
long
be
troubled
with
you
you
shall
have
some
part
of
your
will
I
pray
you
leave
me
ORLANDO
I
no
further
offend
you
than
becomes
me
for
my
good
OLIVER
Get
you
with
him
you
old
dog
ADAM
Is
old
dog
my
reward
Most
true
I
have
lost
my
teeth
in
your
service
God
be
with
my
old
master
He
would
not
have
spoke
such
a
word
Exeunt
ORLANDO
and
ADAM
OLIVER
Is
it
even
so
Begin
you
to
grow
upon
me
I
will
physic
your
rankness
and
yet
give
no
thousand
crowns
neither
