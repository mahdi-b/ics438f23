Yet

Until
your
lordship
came
to
see
his
end
Which
now
the
loving
haste
of
these
our
friends
Something
against

Because
my

I
would
have
had
you
heard
The

speak
and
timorously
confess
The
manner

the
purpose
of
his
treasons
That
you
might
well
have
signified
the

Unto
the

who
haply

Misconster

wail
his

MAYOR
But
my
good
lord
your
Grace
s
words
shall
serve
As
well
as
I
had
seen
and
heard
him
speak
And
do
not
doubt
right
noble
Princes
both
But
I
ll
acquaint
our
duteous
citizens
With
all
your
just
proceedings
in
this
cause
GLOUCESTER
And
to
that
end
we
wish
d
your

here
T
avoid
the
the
the
censures
of
the
carping
world

Which
since
you
come
too
late

Infer
the
bastardy
of
Edward

children
Tell
them
how
Edward
put
to
death
a
citizen
Only
for
saying
he
would
make
his
son
Heir
to
the
crown
meaning
indeed
his
house
Which
by
the
sign
thereof
was
termed
so
Moreover
urge
his
hateful
luxury
And
bestial
appetite
in
change
of
lust
Which
stretch
d
unto
their
servants
daughters
wives
Even
where
his
raging
eye
or
savage
heart
Without
control
lusted
to
make
a
prey
Nay
for
a
need
thus
far
come
near
my
person
Tell
them
when
that
my
mother
went
with
child
Of
that
insatiate
Edward
noble
York
My
princely
father
then
had
wars
in
France
And
by
true
computation
of
the
time
Found
that
the
issue
was
not
his
begot
Which
well
appeared
in
his
lineaments
Being
nothing
like
the
noble
Duke
my
father
Yet
touch
this
sparingly
as
twere
far
off
Because
my
lord
you
know
my
mother
lives
BUCKINGHAM
Doubt
not
my
lord
I

plead
Were

my

Exeunt

Now

To

What

the

BUCKINGHAM
Now
by
the
holy
Mother
of
our
Lord
The
citizens
are
mum
say
not
a
word
GLOUCESTER
Touch
d
you
the
bastardy
of
Edward
s
children
BUCKINGHAM
I
did
with
his
contract
with
Lady
Lucy
And
his
contract
by
deputy
in
France
Th
insatiate
greediness
of
his
desire
And
his
enforcement
of
the
city
wives
His
tyranny
for
trifles
his
own
bastardy
As
being
got
your
father
then
in
France
And
his
resemblance
being
not
like
the
Duke
Withal
I
did
infer
your
lineaments
Being
the
right
idea
of
your
father
Both
in
your
form
and
nobleness
of
mind
Laid
open
all
your
victories
in
Scotland
Your
discipline
in
war
wisdom
in
peace
Your
bounty
virtue
fair
humility
Indeed
left
nothing
fitting
for
your
purpose
Untouch
d
or
slightly
handled
in
discourse
And
when
mine
oratory
drew
toward
end
I
bid
them
that
did
love
their
country
s
good
Cry
God
save
Richard
England
s
royal
King
GLOUCESTER
And
did
they
so
BUCKINGHAM
No
so
God
help
me
they
spake
not
a
word
But
like
dumb
statues
or
breathing
stones
Star
d
each
on
other
and
look
d
deadly
pale
Which
when
I
saw
I
reprehended
them
And
ask
d
the
Mayor
what
meant
this
wilfull
silence
His
answer
was
the
people
were
not
used
To
be
spoke
to
but
by
the
Recorder
Then
he
was
urg
d
to
tell
my
tale
again
Thus
saith
the
Duke
thus
hath
the
Duke
inferr
d
But
nothing
spoke
in
warrant
from
himself
When
he
had
done
some
followers
of
mine
own
At
lower
end
of
the
hall
hurl
d
up
their
caps
And
some
ten
voices
cried
God
save
King
Richard
And
thus
I
took
the
vantage
of
those
few
Thanks
gentle
citizens
and
friends
quoth
I
This
general
applause
and
cheerful
shout
Argues
your
wisdoms
and
your
love
to
Richard
And
even
here
brake
off
and
came
away
GLOUCESTER
What
tongueless
blocks
were
they
Would
they
not
speak
Will
not
the
Mayor
then
and
his
brethren
come
BUCKINGHAM
The
Mayor
is
here
at
hand
Intend
some
fear
Be
not
you
spoke
with
but
by
mighty
suit
And
look
you
get
a
prayer
book
in
your
hand
And
stand
between
two
churchmen
good
my
lord
For
on
that
ground
I
ll
make
a
holy
descant
And
be
not
easily
won

requests
Play
the

answer
nay

I
go

if
you
plead

CATESBY
He
doth
entreat
your

my

To
visit
him
to
morrow
or
next
day
He
is
within

two
right
reverend
fathers
Divinely
bent
to

And
in

would

this

He
is
not
lolling
on

lewd

bed
But
on
his
knees
at
meditation
Not
dallying
with
a
brace
of
courtezans
But
meditating
with
two
deep
divines
Not
sleeping
to
engross
his
idle
body
But
praying
to
enrich
his
watchful
soul
Happy
were
England
would
this
virtuous
prince
Take
on
his
Grace
the
sovereignty
thereof
But
sure
I
fear
we
shall
not
win
him

Now
Catesby
what
says
his
Grace
CATESBY
My

He
wonders
to
what
end
you
have
assembled
Such
troops
of
citizens
to
come
to
him
His

not
being
warn
d
thereof
before
He
fears
my
lord
you
mean
no
good
to
him
BUCKINGHAM
Sorry
I
am
my
noble
cousin
should
Suspect
me
that
I
mean
no
good
to
him
By
heaven
we
come
to
him
in
perfect
love
And
so
once
more
return
and
tell
his
Grace
Exit
CATESBY

True

the
interruption
Of

GLOUCESTER
My

there
needs
no
such
apology

your

pardon
me
Who

my
God
Deferr
d
the
visitation
of
my

is

BUCKINGHAM
Even
that
I
hope
which
pleaseth
God
above
And
all
good
men
of
this
ungovern
d
isle
GLOUCESTER
I
do
suspect
I
have
done
some
offence
That
seems
disgracious
in
the
city
s
eye
And
that
you
come
to
reprehend
my
ignorance
BUCKINGHAM
You
have
my
lord
Would
it
might
please
your
Grace
On
our
entreaties
to
amend
your
fault
GLOUCESTER
Else
wherefore
breathe
I
in
a
Christian
land
BUCKINGHAM
Know
then
it
is
your
fault
that
you
resign
The
supreme
seat
the
throne
majestical
The
scept
red
office
of
your
ancestors
Your
state
of
fortune
and
your
due
of
birth
The
lineal
glory
of
your
royal
house
To
the
corruption
of
a
blemish
d
stock
Whiles
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
Which
here
we
waken
to
our
country
s
good
The
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
Her
face
defac
d
with
scars
of
infamy
Her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
And
almost
should
red
in
the
swallowing
gulf
Of
dark
forgetfulness
and
deep
oblivion
Which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
Your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
And
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
Not
as
protector
steward
substitute
Or
lowly
factor
for
another
s
gain
But
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
Your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
For
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
Your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
And
by
their
vehement
instigation
In
this
just
cause
come
I
to
move
your
Grace
GLOUCESTER
I
cannot
tell
if
to
depart
in
silence
Or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
Best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
If
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
Tongue
tied
ambition
not
replying
yielded
To
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovereignty
Which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
If
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
So
season
d
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
Then
on
the
other
side
I
check
d
my
friends
Therefore
to
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
And
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
Definitively
thus
I
answer
you
Your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
Unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
First
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
And
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
As
the
ripe
revenue
and
due
of
birth
Yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
So
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
That
I
would
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
Being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
Than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
And
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smother
d
But
God
be
thank
d
there
is
no
need
of
me
And
much
I
need
to
help
you
were
there
need
The
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
Which
mellow
d
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
Will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
And
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
On
him
I
lay
that
you
would
lay
on
me
The
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
Which
God
defend
that
I
should
wring
from
him
BUCKINGHAM
My
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
Grace
But
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
All
circumstances
well
considered
You
say
that
Edward
is
your
brother
s
son
So
say
we
too
but
not
by
Edward
s
wife
For
first
was
he
contract
to
Lady
Lucy
Your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
his
vow
And
afterward
by
substitute
betroth
d
To
Bona
sister
to
the
King
of
France
These
both
put
off
a
poor
petitioner
A
care
craz
d
mother
to
a
many
sons
A
beauty
waning
and
distressed
widow
Even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
Made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
wanton
eye
Seduc
d
the
pitch
and
height
of
his
degree
To
base
declension
and
loath
d
bigamy
By
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
This
Edward
whom
our
manners
call
the
Prince
More
bitterly
could
I
expostulate
Save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
I
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
Then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
This
proffer
d
benefit
of
dignity
If
not
to
bless
us
and
the
land
withal
Yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble

From
the
corruption
of
abusing
times
Unto
a
lineal
true
derived
course
MAYOR
Do
good
my

your

you
BUCKINGHAM
Refuse
not
mighty

this
proffer
d
love
CATESBY
O
make
them
joyful
grant
their
lawful
suit
GLOUCESTER
Alas
why
would
you
heap
this
care
on
me
I
am
unfit
for
state
and
majesty
I
do
beseech
you
take
it
not
amiss
I
cannot
nor
I
will
not
yield
to
you
BUCKINGHAM
If
you
refuse
it
as
in
love
and
zeal
Loath
to
depose
the
child
your
brother

son
As
well
we
know
your
tenderness
of
heart
And
gentle
kind
effeminate
remorse
Which
we
have
noted
in
you
to
your
kindred
And
egally
indeed
to
all
estates
Yet
know
whe
er
you
accept
our
suit
or
no
Your
brother
s
son
shall
never
reign
our
king
But
we
will
plant
some
other
in
the
throne
To
the
disgrace
and
downfall
of
your
house
And
in
this
resolution
here
we
leave
you
Come
citizens
Zounds
I
ll
entreat
no
more
GLOUCESTER

not
swear
my

Exeunt

CATESBY
Call
him
again
sweet
Prince
accept
their
suit
If
you
deny
them
all
the
land
will
rue
it
GLOUCESTER
Will
you
enforce
me
to
a
world
of
cares
Call
them
again
I
am
not
made
of
stones
But
penetrable
to
your
kind
entreaties
Albeit
against
my
conscience
and
my
soul
Re
enter
BUCKINGHAM
and
the
rest
Cousin
of
Buckingham

sage
grave
men
Since
you
will
buckle
fortune
on
my
back
To
bear
her
burden
whe
er
I
will
or
no
I
must
have
patience
to
endure
the
load
But
if
black
scandal
or
foul
fac
d
reproach
Attend
the
sequel
of
your
imposition
Your
mere
enforcement
shall
acquittance
me
From
all
the
impure
blots
and
stains
thereof
For
God
doth
know
and
you
may
partly
see
How
far
I
am
from

desire
of
this
MAYOR
God
bless
your

We
see
it
and
will
say
it
GLOUCESTER
In

DORSET
Be
of
good
cheer

fares
your
Grace
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
O
Dorset
speak
not
to
me
get
thee
gone
Death
and
destruction
dogs
thee
at
thy
heels
Thy
mother
s
name
is
ominous
to
children
If
thou
wilt
outstrip
death
go
cross
the
seas
And
live
with
Richmond
from
the
reach
of
hell
Go
hie
thee
hie
thee
from
this
slaughter
house
Lest
thou
increase
the
number
of
the
dead
And
make
me
die
the
thrall
of
Margaret
s
curse
Nor
mother
wife
nor
England
s
counted
queen
STANLEY
Full
of
wise
care
is
this
your
counsel
madam
Take
all
the
swift
advantage
of
the
hours
You
shall
have
letters
from
me
to
my
son
In
your
behalf
to
meet
you
on
the
way
Be
not
ta
en
tardy
by
unwise
delay
DUCHESS
O
ill
dispersing
wind
of
misery
O
my
accursed
womb
the
bed
of
death
A
cockatrice
hast
thou
hatch
d
to
the
world
Whose
unavoided
eye
is
murderous
STANLEY
Come
madam
come
I
in
all
haste
was
sent
ANNE
And
I
with
all
unwillingness
will
go
O
would
to
God
that
the
inclusive
verge
Of
golden
metal
that
must
round
my
brow
Were
red
hot
steel
to
sear
me
to
the
brains
Anointed
let
me
be
with
deadly
venom
And
die
ere
men
can
say
God
save
the
Queen
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Go
go
poor
soul
I
envy
not
thy
glory
To
feed
my
humour
wish
thyself
no
harm
ANNE
No
why
When
he
that
is
my
husband
now
Came
to
me
as
I
follow
d
Henry
s
corse
When
scarce
the
blood
was
well
wash
d
from
his
hands
Which
issued
from
my
other
angel
husband
And
that
dear
saint
which
then
I
weeping
follow
d
O
when
I
say
I
look
d
on
Richard
s
face
This
was
my
wish
Be
thou
quoth
I
accurs
d
For
making
me
so
young
so
old
a
widow
And
when
thou
wed
st
let
sorrow
haunt
thy
bed
And
be
thy
wife
if
any
be
so
mad
More
miserable
by
the
life
of
thee
Than
thou
hast
made
me
by
my
dear
lord
s
death
Lo
ere
I
can
repeat
this
curse
again
Within
so
small
a
time
my
woman
s
heart
Grossly
grew
captive
to
his
honey
words
And
prov
d
the
subject
of
mine
own
soul
s
curse
Which
hitherto
hath
held
my
eyes
from
rest
For
never
yet
one
hour
in
his
bed
Did
I
enjoy
the
golden
dew
of
sleep
But
with
his
timorous
dreams
was
still
awak
d
Besides
he
hates
me
for
my
father
Warwick
And
will
no
doubt
shortly
be
rid
of
me
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Poor
heart
adieu
I
pity
thy
complaining
ANNE
No
more
than
with
my
soul
I
mourn
for
yours
DORSET
Farewell
thou
woeful
welcomer
of
glory
ANNE
Adieu
poor
soul
that
tak
st
thy
leave
of
it
DUCHESS
To
DORSET
Go
thou
to
Richmond
and
good
fortune
guide
thee
To
ANNE
Go
thou
to
Richard
and
good
angels
tend
thee
To
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Go
thou
to
sanctuary
and
good
thoughts
possess
thee
I
to
my
grave
where
peace
and
rest
lie
with
me
Eighty
odd
years
of
sorrow
have
I
seen
And
each
hour
s
joy
wreck
d
with
a
week
of
teen
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
Stay
yet
look
back
with
me
unto
the
Tower
Pity
you
ancient
stones
those
tender
babes
Whom
envy
hath
immur
d
within
your
walls
Rough
cradle
for
such
little
pretty
ones
Rude
ragged
nurse
old
sullen
playfellow
For
tender
princes
use
my
babies
well
So
foolish
sorrows
bids
your
stones
farewell
