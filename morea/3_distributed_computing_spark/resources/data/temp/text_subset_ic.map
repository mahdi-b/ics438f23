Hail

What

By

Hector
bade
ask
AGAMEMNON
Which
way
would
Hector
have
it
AENEAS
He
cares
not
he

obey

ACHILLES
Tis
done
like

A

The

Weigh

And
that
which
looks
like
pride
is
courtesy
This
Ajax
is
half
made
of
Hector

blood
In
love
whereof
half
Hector
stays

Half

O
I

you
Re

DIOMEDES
AGAMEMNON
Here

Sir
Diomed
Go
gentle
knight
Stand
by
our
Ajax
As
you
and
Lord
Eneas
Consent
upon
the
order
of
their
fight
So
be
it
either
to
the
uttermost
Or

The

Half
stints

begin
AJAX
and
HECTOR
enter

lists
ULYSSES
They
are
oppos

already
AGAMEMNON
What
Troyan
is
that
same
that
looks
so
heavy
ULYSSES
The
youngest
son
of
Priam
a
true
knight
Not
yet
mature
yet
matchless
firm
of
word
Speaking
in
deeds
and
deedless
in
his
tongue
Not
soon
provok
d
nor
being
provok
d
soon
calm
d
His
heart
and
hand
both
open
and
both
free
For
what
he
has
he
gives
what
thinks
he
shows
Yet
gives
he
not
till
judgment
guide
his
bounty
Nor
dignifies
an
impair
thought
with
breath
Manly
as
Hector
but
more
dangerous
For
Hector
in
his
blaze
of
wrath
subscribes
To
tender
objects
but
he
in
heat
of
action
Is
more
vindicative
than
jealous
love
They
call
him
Troilus
and
on
him
erect
A
second
hope
as
fairly
built
as
Hector
Thus
says
Aeneas
one
that
knows
the
youth
Even
to
his
inches
and
with
private
soul
Did
in
great
Ilion
thus
translate
him
to
me
Alarum
HECTOR

I

Thou

great
lord
my

sister

son
A
cousin
german
to
great
Priam

The
obligation
of
our

forbids
A
gory
emulation
twixt
us
twain
Were
thy
commixtion
Greek
and
Troyan
so
That
thou
could
st
say
This
hand
is
Grecian

Troyan

All

Runs

shouldst
not
bear
from
me
a
Greekish
member
Wherein
my
sword
had
not
impressure
made
Of
our
rank
feud
but
the
just
gods
gainsay
That
any
drop
thou

thy

My
sacred
aunt
should

my
mortal
sword
Be

Let
me

By

lusty

Hector

him
thus
Cousin
all

AJAX
I
thank
thee
Hector
Thou
art
too
gentle
and
too
free
a
man
I
came
to
kill
thee
cousin
and
bear
hence
A
great
addition
earned
in
thy
death
HECTOR
Not
Neoptolemus
so
mirable
On
whose
bright
crest
Fame
with
her
loud
st
Oyes
Cries
This
is
he
could
promise
to
himself
A
thought
of
added
honour
torn
from
Hector
AENEAS
There
is
expectance
here
from
both
the
sides
What
further
you
will
do
HECTOR
We

answer
it
The
issue
is
embracement
Ajax
farewell
AJAX
If
I
might
in
entreaties
find
success
As

To

Desire

I

AGAMEMNON

Great
Agamemnon

HECTOR
The
worthiest
of

my

searching

Shall

AGAMEMNON

You

HECTOR
Who
must
we
answer
AENEAS
The
noble
Menelaus
HECTOR
O
you
my
lord
By
Mars
his
gauntlet
thanks
Mock
not
that
I
affect
the
untraded
oath
Your
quondam
wife
swears
still
by
Venus
glove
She
s
well
but
bade
me
not
commend
her
to
you
MENELAUS
Name
her
not
now
sir
she
s
a
deadly
theme
HECTOR
O
pardon
I
offend
NESTOR
I
have
thou
gallant
Troyan
seen
thee
oft
Labouring
for
destiny
make
cruel
way
Through
ranks
of
Greekish
youth
and
I
have
seen
thee
As
hot
as
Perseus
spur
thy
Phrygian
steed
Despising
many
forfeits
and
subduements
When
thou
hast
hung
thy
advanced
sword
i
th
air
Not
letting
it
decline
on
the
declined
That
I
have
said
to
some
my
standers
by
Lo
Jupiter
is
yonder
dealing
life
And
I
have
seen
thee
pause
and
take
thy
breath
When
that
a
ring
of
Greeks
have
hemm
d
thee
in
Like
an
Olympian
wrestling
This
have
I
seen
But
this
thy
countenance
still
lock
d
in
steel
I
never
saw
till
now
I
knew
thy
grandsire
And
once
fought
with
him
He
was
a
soldier
good
But
by
great
Mars
the
captain
of
us
all
Never
like
thee
O
let
an
old
man
embrace
thee
And
worthy
warrior
welcome
to
our
tents
AENEAS
Tis
the
old
Nestor
HECTOR
Let
me
embrace
thee
good
old
chronicle
That
hast
so
long
walk
d
hand
in
hand
with
time
Most
reverend
Nestor
I
am
glad
to
clasp
thee
NESTOR
I
would
my
arms
could
match
thee
in
contention
As
they
contend
with
thee
in
courtesy
HECTOR
I
would
they
could
NESTOR
Ha
By
this
white
beard
I
d
fight
with
thee
to
morrow
Well
welcome
welcome
I
have
seen
the
time
ULYSSES
I
wonder
now
how
yonder
city
stands
When
we
have
here
her
base
and
pillar
by
us
HECTOR
I
know
your
favour
Lord
Ulysses
well
Ah
sir
there
s
many
a
Greek
and
Troyan
dead
Since
first
I
saw
yourself
and
Diomed
In
Ilion
on
your
Greekish
embassy
ULYSSES
Sir
I
foretold
you
then
what
would
ensue
My
prophecy
is
but
half
his
journey
yet
For
yonder
walls
that
pertly
front
your
town
Yond
towers
whose
wanton
tops
do
buss
the
clouds
Must
kiss
their
own
feet
HECTOR
I
must
not
believe
you
There
they
stand
yet
and
modestly
I
think
The
fall
of
every
Phrygian
stone
will
cost
A
drop
of
Grecian
blood
The
end
crowns
all
And
that
old
common
arbitrator
Time
Will
one
day
end
it
ULYSSES
So
to
him
we
leave
it
Most
gentle
and
most
valiant
Hector
welcome
After
the
General
I
beseech
you
next
To
feast
with
me
and
see
me
at
my
tent
ACHILLES
I
shall
forestall
thee
Lord
Ulysses
thou
Now
Hector

fed
mine
eyes
on
thee
I

exact
view
perus
d
thee
Hector
And
quoted

this
Achilles
ACHILLES
I

Achilles
HECTOR
Stand
fair
I
pray
thee
let
me
look
on
thee
ACHILLES
Behold
thy
fill
HECTOR
Nay
I
have
done
already
ACHILLES
Thou
art
too
brief
I
will
the
second
time
As
I
would
buy
thee
view
thee
limb
by
limb
HECTOR
O
like
a
book
of
sport
thou
lt
read
me
o
er
But
there
s
more
in
me
than
thou
understand
st
Why
dost
thou
so
oppress
me
with
thine
eye
ACHILLES
Tell
me
you
heavens
in
which
part
of
his
body
Shall
I
destroy
him
Whether
there
or
there
or
there
That
I
may
give
the
local
wound
a
name
And
make
distinct
the
very
breach
whereout
Hector
s
great
spirit
flew
Answer
me
heavens
HECTOR
It
would
discredit
the
blest
gods
proud
man
To
answer
such
a
question
Stand
again
Think
st
thou
to
catch
my
life
so
pleasantly
As
to
prenominate
in
nice
conjecture
Where
thou
wilt
hit
me
dead
ACHILLES
I
tell
thee
yea
HECTOR
Wert
thou
an
oracle
to
tell
me
so
I
d
not
believe
thee
Henceforth
guard
thee
well
For
I
ll
not
kill
thee
there
nor
there
nor
there
But
by
the
forge
that
stithied
Mars
his
helm
I
ll
kill
thee
everywhere
yea
o
er
and
o
er
You
wisest
Grecians
pardon
me
this
brag
His
insolence
draws
folly
from
my
lips
But
I
ll
endeavour
deeds
to
match
these
words
Or
may
I
never
AJAX
Do
not
chafe
thee
cousin
And
you
Achilles
let
these
threats
alone
Till
accident
or
purpose
bring
you
to
t
You
may
have
every
day
enough
of
Hector
If
you
have
stomach
The
general
state
I
fear
Can
scarce
entreat
you
to
be
odd
with
him
HECTOR
I
pray
you
let
us
see
you
in
the
field
We
have
had
pelting
wars
since
you
refus
d
The
Grecians
cause
ACHILLES
Dost
thou
entreat
me
Hector
To
morrow
do
I
meet
thee
fell
as
death
To
night
all
friends
HECTOR
Thy
hand
upon
that
match
AGAMEMNON
First
all
you
peers
of
Greece
go
to
my
tent
There
in
the
full
convive
we
afterwards
As
Hector
s
leisure
and
your
bounties
shall
Concur
together
severally
entreat
him
Beat
loud
the
tambourines
let
the
trumpets
blow
That
this
great
soldier
may
his
welcome
know
Exeunt

but
TROILUS
and
ULYSSES
TROILUS
My
Lord
Ulysses
tell
me
I
beseech
you
In
what
place
of
the
field
doth
Calchas
keep
ULYSSES
At
Menelaus
tent
most
princely
Troilus
There
Diomed
doth
feast
with
him
to
night
Who
neither
looks
upon
the
heaven
nor
earth
But
gives
all
gaze
and
bent
of
amorous
view
On
the
fair
Cressid
TROILUS
Shall
I
sweet
lord
be
bound
to
you
so
much
After
we
part
from
Agamemnon

tent
To

thither
ULYSSES
You
shall
command

As

of
what
honour
was
This
Cressida
in
Troy
Had

That

absence
TROILUS
O

A

Will

Hecuba
A
token
from

my
fair
love
Both
taxing
me
and
gaging

to
keep
An
oath
that
I
have
sworn
I

Fall
