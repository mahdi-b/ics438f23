Lear
Ay
so
I
think
Alb
He
knows
not
what

and
vain
is
it
That
we
present

Very

Capt

You

What

Shall

With

Such

All

The

O

Let

Live

And

When

That

And

Therefore
brave

That

You

LONGAVILLE

Fat

Make

bankrupt
quite

DUMAIN
My
loving
lord
Dumain
is
mortified
The
grosser
manner
of
these
world
s
delights
He
throws
upon
the
gross
world
s
baser
slaves
To
love
to
wealth
to
pomp
I
pine
and
die
With
all
these
living
in
philosophy
BEROWNE
I
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
So
much
dear
liege
I
have
already
sworn
That
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
But
there
are
other
strict
observances
As
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
Which
I
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
And
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
And
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
The
which
I
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
And
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
And
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
day
When
I
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
And
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
day
Which
I
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
O
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
Not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
KING
Your
oath
is
pass
d
to
pass
away
from
these
BEROWNE
Let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
I
only
swore
to
study
with
your
Grace
And
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
LONGAVILLE
You
swore
to
that
Berowne
and
to
the
rest
BEROWNE
By
yea
and
nay
sir
then
I
swore
in
jest
What
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
KING
Why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
BEROWNE
Things
hid
and
barr
d
you
mean
from
common
sense
KING
Ay
that
is
study
s
god
like
recompense
BEROWNE
Come
on
then
I
will
swear
to
study
so
To
know
the
thing
I
am
forbid
to
know
As
thus
to
study
where
I
well
may
dine
When
I
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
Or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
When
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
Or
having
sworn
too
hard
a
keeping
oath
Study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
If
study
s
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
Study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
Swear
me
to
this
and
I
will
ne
er
say
no
KING
These
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
And
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
BEROWNE
Why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
Which
with
pain
purchas
d
doth
inherit
pain
As
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
To
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
Doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
Light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
So
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
Your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
Study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
By
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
Who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
And
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by
Study
is
like
the
heaven
s
glorious
sun
That
will
not
be
deep
search
d
with
saucy
looks
Small
have
continual
plodders
ever
won
Save
base
authority
from
others
books
These
earthly
godfathers
of
heaven
s
lights
That
give
a
name
to
every
fixed
star
Have
no
more
profit
of
their
shining
nights
Than
those
that
walk
and
wot
not
what
they
are
Too
much
to
know
is
to
know
nought
but
fame
And
every
godfather
can
give
a
name
KING
How
well
he
s
read
to
reason
against
reading
DUMAIN
Proceeded
well
to
stop
all
good
proceeding
LONGAVILLE
He
weeds
the
corn
and
still
lets
grow
the
weeding
BEROWNE
The
spring
is
near
when
green
geese
are
a
breeding
DUMAIN
How
follows
that
BEROWNE
Fit
in
his
place
and
time
DUMAIN
In
reason
nothing
BEROWNE
Something
then
in
rhyme
LONGAVILLE
Berowne
is
like
an
envious
sneaping
frost
That
bites
the
first
born
infants
of
the
spring
BEROWNE
Well
say
I
am
why
should
proud
summer
boast
Before
the
birds
have
any
cause
to
sing
Why
should
I
joy
in
any
abortive
birth
At
Christmas
I
no
more
desire
a
rose
Than
wish
a
snow
in
May
s
new
fangled
shows
But
like
of
each
thing
that
in
season
grows
So
you
to
study
now
it
is
too
late
Climb
o
er
the
house
to
unlock
the
little
gate
KING
Well
sit
out
go
home
Berowne
adieu
BEROWNE
No
my
good
lord
I
have
sworn
to
stay
with
you
And
though
I
have
for
barbarism
spoke
more
Than
for
that
angel
knowledge
you
can
say
Yet
confident
I
ll
keep
what
I
have
swore
And
bide
the
penance
of
each
three
years
day
Give
me
the
paper
let
me
read
the
same
And
to
the
strictest
decrees
I
ll
write
my
name
KING
How
well
this
yielding
rescues
thee
from
shame
BEROWNE
Reads
Item
That
no
woman
shall
come
within
a
mile
of
my
court
Hath
this
been
proclaimed
LONGAVILLE
Four
days
ago
BEROWNE
Let
s
see
the
penalty
Reads
on
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
Who
devis
d
this
penalty
LONGAVILLE
Marry
that
did
I
BEROWNE
Sweet
lord
and
why
LONGAVILLE
To
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
BEROWNE
A
dangerous
law
against
gentility
Reads
Item
If
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
This
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
For
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
The
French
king
s
daughter
with
yourself
to
speak
A
mild
of
grace
and
complete
majesty
About
surrender
up
of
Aquitaine
To
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
Therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
Or
vainly
comes
th
admired
princess
hither
KING
What
say
you
lords
Why
this
was
quite
forgot
BEROWNE
So
study
evermore
is
over
shot
While
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
It
doth
forget
to
do
the
thing
it
should
And
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
Tis
won
as
towns
with
fire
so
won
so
lost
KING
We
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
She
must
lie
here
on
mere
necessity
BEROWNE
Necessity
will
make
us
all
forsworn
Three
thousand
times
within
this
three
years
space
For
every
man
with
his
affects
is
born
Not
by
might
mast
red
but
by
special
grace
If
I
break
faith
this
word
shall
speak
for
me
I
am
forsworn
on
mere
necessity
So
to
the
laws
at
large
I
write
my
name
Subscribes
And
he
that
breaks
them
in
the
least
degree
Stands
in
attainder
of
eternal
shame
Suggestions
are
to
other
as
to
me
But
I
believe
although
I
seem
so
loath
I
am
the
last
that
will
last
keep
his
oath
But
is
there
no
quick
recreation
granted
KING
Ay
that
there
is
Our
court
you
know
is
haunted
With
a
refined
traveller
of
Spain
A
man
in
all
the
world
s
new
fashion
planted
That
hath
a
mint
of
phrases
in
his
brain
One
who
the
music
of
his
own
vain
tongue
Doth
ravish
like
enchanting
harmony
A
man
of
complements
whom
right
and
wrong
Have
chose
as
umpire
of
their
mutiny
This
child
of
fancy
that
Armado
hight
For
interim
to
our
studies
shall
relate
In
high
born
words
the
worth
of
many
a
knight
From
tawny
Spain
lost
in
the
world
s
debate
How
you
delight
my
lords
I
know
not
I
But
I
protest
I
love
to
hear
him
lie
And
I
will
use
him
for
my
minstrelsy
BEROWNE
Armado

A

LONGAVILLE
Costard

he

so

years
is
but
short
Enter
DULL
a
constable
with
a
letter
and
COSTARD
DULL
Which
is

BEROWNE
This
fellow
What
wouldst
DULL
I
myself
reprehend
his
own
person
for
I
am
his
Grace

farborough
but
I
would
see
his

person
in
flesh
and
blood
BEROWNE
This

DULL
Signior
Arme

commends
you
There

this

you

COSTARD
Sir
the
contempts
thereof
are
as
touching
me
KING
A
letter
from
the
magnificent
Armado
BEROWNE
How
low
soever
the
matter
I
hope
in
God
for
high
words
LONGAVILLE
A
high
hope
for
a
low
heaven
God
grant
us
patience
BEROWNE
To
hear
or
forbear
hearing
LONGAVILLE
To
hear
meekly
sir
and
to
laugh
moderately
or
to
forbear
both
BEROWNE
Well
sir
be
it
as
the
style
shall
give
us
cause
to
climb
in
the
merriness
COSTARD
The
matter
is
to
me
sir
as
concerning
Jaquenetta
The
manner
of
it
is
I
was
taken
with
the
manner
BEROWNE
In
what
manner
COSTARD
In
manner
and
form
following
sir
all
those
three
I
was
seen
with
her
in
the
manor
house
sitting
with
her
upon
the
form
and
taken
following
her
into
the
park
which
put
together
is
in
manner
and
form
following
Now
sir
for
the
manner
it
is
the
manner
of
a
man
to
speak
to
a
woman
For
the
form
in
some
form
BEROWNE
For
the
following
sir
COSTARD
As
it
shall
follow
in
my
correction
and
God
defend
the
right
KING
Will
you
hear
this
letter
with
attention
BEROWNE
As
we
would
hear
an
oracle
COSTARD
Such
is
the
simplicity
of
man
to
hearken
after
the
flesh
KING
Reads

COSTARD
Not
a

So

It
may
be
so

if

it

No

Of

I

So

as
I
am
a
gentleman
betook
myself
to
walk
The
time
When
About
the
sixth
hour
when
beasts
most
graze
birds
best
peck
and
men
sit
down
to
that
nourishment
which
is
called
supper
So
much
for
the
time
When
Now
for
the
ground
Which
which
I
mean
I
upon
it
is
ycleped
thy
park
Then
for
the
place
Where
where
I
mean
I
did
encounter
that
obscene
and
most
prepost
rous
event
that
draweth
from
my
snow
white
pen
the
ebon
coloured
ink
which
here
thou
viewest
beholdest
surveyest
or
seest
But
to
the
place
Where
It
standeth
north
north
east
and
by
east
from
the
west
corner
of
thy
curious
knotted
garden
There
did
I
see
that
low
spirited
swain
that
base
minnow
of
thy
mirth
COSTARD
Me

that
unlettered
small

that

Still

O

This
is
not
so
well
as
I
look
d
for
but
the
best
that
ever
I
heard
KING
Ay
the
best
for
the
worst
But
sirrah
what
say
you
to
this
COSTARD
Sir
I
confess
the
wench
KING
Did
you
hear
the
proclamation
COSTARD
I
do
confess
much
of
the
hearing
it
but
little
of
the
marking
of
it
KING
It
was
proclaimed
a
year
s
imprisonment
to
be
taken
with
a
wench
COSTARD
I
was
taken
with
none
sir
I
was
taken
with
a
damsel
KING
Well
it
was
proclaimed
damsel
COSTARD
This
was
no
damsel
neither
sir
she
was
a
virgin
KING
It
is
so
varied
too
for
it
was
proclaimed
virgin
COSTARD
If
it
were
I
deny
her
virginity
I
was
taken
with
a
maid
KING
This
maid
not
serve
your
turn
sir
COSTARD
This
maid
will
serve
my
turn
sir
KING
Sir
I
will
pronounce
your
sentence
you
shall
fast
a
week
with
bran
and
water
COSTARD
I
had
rather
pray
a
month
with
mutton
and
porridge
KING
And
Don
Armado
shall
be
your
keeper
My
Lord
Berowne
see
him
delivered

go

to

in

that
Which

I

lay
my

These

will
prove
an
idle
scorn
Sirrah
come
on
COSTARD
I
suffer
for
the
truth
sir
for
true
it
is
I
was
taken
with
Jaquenetta
and
Jaquenetta
is
a
true
girl
and
therefore
welcome

SCENE
II
The
park
Enter
ARMADO
and
MOTH
his
page
ARMADO
Boy
what
sign
is
it
when
a
man
of
great
spirit
grows
melancholy
MOTH
A
great
sign
sir
that
he
will
look
sad
ARMADO
Why
sadness
is
one
and
the
self
same
thing
dear
imp
MOTH
No
no
O
Lord
sir
no
ARMADO
How
canst
thou
part
sadness
and
melancholy
my
tender
juvenal
MOTH
By
a
familiar
demonstration
of
the
working
my
tough
signior
ARMADO
Why
tough
signior
Why
tough
signior
MOTH
Why
tender
juvenal
Why
tender
juvenal
ARMADO
I
spoke
it
tender
juvenal
as
a
congruent
epitheton
appertaining
to
thy
young
days
which
we
may
nominate
tender
MOTH
And
I
tough
signior
as
an
appertinent
title
to
your
old
time
which
we
may
name
tough
ARMADO
Pretty
and
apt
MOTH
How
mean
you
sir
I
pretty
and
my
saying
apt
or
I
apt
and
my
saying
pretty
ARMADO
Thou
pretty
because
little
MOTH
Little
pretty
because
little
Wherefore
apt
ARMADO
And
therefore
apt
because
quick
MOTH
Speak
you
this
in
my
praise
master
ARMADO
In
thy
condign
praise
MOTH
I
will
praise
an
eel
with
the
same
praise
ARMADO
that
an
eel
is
ingenious
MOTH
That
an
eel
is
quick
ARMADO
I
do
say
thou
art
quick
in
answers
thou
heat
st
my
blood
MOTH
I
am
answer
d
sir
ARMADO
I
love
not
to
be
cross
d
MOTH
Aside
He
speaks
the
mere
contrary
crosses
love
not
him
ARMADO
I
have
promised
to
study
three
years
with
the
Duke
MOTH
You
may
do
it
in
an
hour
sir
ARMADO
Impossible
MOTH
How
many
is
one
thrice
told
ARMADO
I
am
ill
at
reck
ning
it
fitteth
the
spirit
of
a
tapster
MOTH
You
are
a
gentleman
and
a
gamester
sir
ARMADO
I
confess
both
they
are
both
the
varnish
of
a
complete
man
MOTH
Then
I
am
sure
you
know
how
much
the
gross
sum
of
deuce
ace
amounts
to
ARMADO
It
doth
amount
to
one
more
than
two
MOTH
Which
the
base
vulgar
do
call
three
ARMADO
True
MOTH
Why
sir
is
this
such
a
piece
of
study
Now
here
is
three
studied
ere
ye
ll
thrice
wink
and
how
easy
it
is
to
put
years
to
the
word
three
and
study
three
years
in
two
words
the
dancing
horse
will
tell
you
ARMADO
A
most
fine
figure
MOTH
Aside
To
prove
you
a
cipher
ARMADO
I
will
hereupon
confess
I
am
in
love
And
as
it
is
base
for
a
soldier
to
love
so
am
I
in
love
with
a
base
wench
If
drawing
my
sword
against
the
humour
of
affection
would
deliver
me
from
the
reprobate
thought
of
it
I
would
take
Desire
prisoner
and
ransom
him
to
any
French
courtier
for
a
new
devis
d
curtsy
I
think
scorn
to
sigh
methinks
I
should
out
swear
Cupid
Comfort
me
boy
what
great
men
have
been
in
love
MOTH
Hercules
master
ARMADO
Most
sweet
Hercules
More
authority
dear
boy
name
more
and
sweet
my
child
let
them
be
men
of
good
repute
and
carriage
MOTH
Samson
master
he
was
a
man
of
good
carriage
great
carriage
for
he
carried
the
town
gates
on
his
back
like
a
porter
and
he
was
in
love
ARMADO
O
well
knit
Samson
strong
jointed
Samson
I
do
excel
thee
in
my
rapier
as
much
as
thou
didst
me
in
carrying
gates
I
am
in
love
too
Who
was
Samson
s
love
my
dear
Moth
MOTH
A
woman
master
ARMADO
Of
what
complexion
MOTH
Of
all
the
four
or
the
three
or
the
two
or
one
of
the
four
ARMADO
Tell
me
precisely
of
what
complexion
MOTH
Of
the
sea
water
green
sir
ARMADO
Is
that
one
of
the
four
complexions
MOTH
As
I
have
read
sir
and
the
best
of
them
too
ARMADO
Green
indeed
is
the
colour
of
lovers
but
to
have
a
love
of
that
colour
methinks
Samson
had
small
reason
for
it
He
surely
affected
her
for
her
wit
MOTH
It
was
so
sir
for
she
had
a
green
wit
ARMADO
My
love
is
most
immaculate
white
and
red
MOTH
Most
maculate
thoughts
master
are
mask
d
under
such
colours
ARMADO
Define
define
well
educated
infant
MOTH
My
father
s
wit
my
mother
s
tongue
assist
me
ARMADO
Sweet
invocation
of
a
child
most
pretty
and
pathetical
MOTH
If
she
be
made
of
white
and
red
Her
faults
will
ne
er
be
known
For
blushing
cheeks
by
faults
are
bred
And
fears
by
pale
white
shown
Then
if
she
fear
or
be
to
blame
By
this
you
shall
not
know
For
still
her
cheeks
possess
the
same
Which
native
she
doth
owe
A
dangerous
rhyme
master
against
the
reason
of
white
and
red
ARMADO
Is
there
not
a
ballad
boy
of
the
King
and
the
Beggar
MOTH
The
world
was
very
guilty
of
such
a
ballad
some
three
ages
since
but
I
think
now
tis
not
to
be
found
or
if
it
were
it
would
neither
serve
for
the
writing
nor
the
tune
ARMADO
I
will
have
that
subject
newly
writ
o
er
that
I
may
example
my
digression
by
some
mighty
precedent
Boy
I
do
love
that
country
girl
that
I
took
in
the
park
with
the
rational
hind
