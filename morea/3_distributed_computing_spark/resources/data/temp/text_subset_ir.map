For
being
transported
by
my
jealousies
To
bloody
thoughts
and
to
revenge
I
chose
Camillo
for
the
minister
to
poison
My
friend
Polixenes
which
had
been
done
But
that
the
good
mind
of
Camillo
tardied
My
swift
command
though
I
with
death
and
with
Reward
did
threaten
and
encourage
him
Not
doing
it
and
being
done
He
most
humane
And
fill
d
with
honour
to
my
kingly
guest
Unclasp
d
my
practice
quit
his
fortunes
here
Which
you
knew
great
and
to
the
certain
hazard
Of
all
incertainties
himself
commended
No
richer
than
his
honour
How
he
glisters
Thorough
my
rust
And
how
his
piety
Does
my
deeds
make
the
blacker

FIRST
LORD
What
fit
is
this
good
lady
PAULINA
What
studied
torments
tyrant
hast
for
me
What
wheels
racks
fires
what
flaying
boiling
In
leads
or
oils
What
old
or
newer
torture
Must
I
receive
whose
every
word
deserves
To
taste
of
thy
most
worst
Thy
tyranny
Together
working
with
thy
jealousies
Fancies
too
weak
for
boys
too
green
and
idle
For
girls
of
nine
O
think
what
they
have
done
And
then
run
mad
indeed
stark
mad
for
all
Thy
by
gone
fooleries
were
but
spices
of
it
That
thou
betray
dst
Polixenes
twas
nothing
That
did
but
show
thee
of
a
fool
inconstant
And
damnable
ingrateful
Nor
was
t
much
Thou
wouldst
have
poison
d
good
Camillo
s
honour
To
have
him
kill
a
king
poor
trespasses
More
monstrous
standing
by
whereof
I
reckon
The
casting
forth
to
crows
thy
baby
daughter
To
be
or
none
or
little
though
a
devil
Would
have
shed
water
out
of
fire
ere
done
t
Nor
is
t
directly
laid
to
thee
the
death
Of
the
young
Prince
whose
honourable
thoughts
Thoughts
high
for
one
so
tender
cleft
the
heart
That
could
conceive
a
gross
and
foolish
sire
Blemish
d
his
gracious
dam
This
is
not
no
Laid
to
thy
answer
but
the
last
O
lords
When
I
have
said
cry
Woe
the
Queen
the
Queen
The
sweet
st
dear
st

For

FIRST
LORD
The

PAULINA
I
say

I

If

Prevail
not

If
you
can
bring
Tincture
or
lustre
in
her
lip
her
eye
Heat
outwardly
or
breath
within
I

serve
you
As
I
would
do
the
gods
But
O
thou
tyrant
Do
not
repent
these
things
for
they
are
heavier
Than
all
thy
woes
can
stir
therefore
betake
thee
To
nothing
but
despair
A
thousand
knees
Ten
thousand
years
together
naked
fasting
Upon
a
barren
mountain
and
still
winter
In
storm
perpetual
could
not

To

LORD
Say

PAULINA
I
am
sorry
for

All
faults

make
when
I
shall
come

I
do

Alas
I

The
rashness
of
a
woman
He
is
touch
d
To
th
noble
heart
What

what

Should
be

Do
not

At

petition
I
beseech
you
rather
Let
me
be
punish
d
that

minded
you
Of
what
you
should

Now
good
my
liege
Sir
royal
sir
forgive
a
foolish
woman
The
love
I
bore
your
queen
lo
fool
again
I
ll
speak
of
her
no
more
nor
of
your
children
I
ll
not
remember
you
of
my
own
lord
Who
is
lost
too
Take
your
patience
to
you
And
I
ll
say
nothing
LEONTES
Thou
didst
speak
but
well
When
most
the
truth
which
I
receive
much
better
Than
to
be
pitied
of
thee
Prithee
bring
me
To
the
dead
bodies
of
my
queen
and
son
One
grave
shall
be
for
both
Upon
them
shall
The
causes
of
their
death
appear
unto
Our
shame
perpetual
Once
a
day
I
ll
visit
The
chapel
where
they
lie
and
tears
shed
there
Shall
be
my
recreation
So
long
as
nature
Will
bear
up
with
this
exercise
so
long
I
daily
vow
to
use
it
Come
and
lead

To
these
sorrows

Thou

upon
The
deserts
of
Bohemia
MARINER
Ay
my
lord
and
fear
We
have
landed
in
ill
time
the
skies
look
grimly
And
threaten
present
blusters
In
my
conscience
The
heavens
with
that
we
have
in
hand
are
angry
And
frown
upon
s
ANTIGONUS
Their
sacred
wills
be
done
Go
get
aboard
Look
to
thy
bark
I
ll
not
be
long
before
I
call
upon
thee
MARINER
Make
your
best
haste
and
go
not
Too
far
i
th
land
tis
like
to
be
loud
weather
Besides
this
place
is
famous
for
the
creatures
Of
prey
that
keep
upon
t
ANTIGONUS
Go
thou
away
I
ll
follow
instantly
MARINER
I
am
glad
at
heart
To
be
so
rid
o

business
Exit
ANTIGONUS
Come
poor
babe
I
have
heard
but
not
believ
d
the
spirits

dead
May
walk
again
If
such
thing
be
thy
mother
Appear
d
to
me
last
night
for
ne
er
was
dream
So
like
a
waking
To
me
comes
a
creature
Sometimes
her
head
on
one
side
some
another
I
never
saw
a
vessel
of
like
sorrow
So
fill
d
and
so
becoming
in
pure
white
robes
Like
very
sanctity
she
did
approach
My
cabin
where
I
lay
thrice
bow
d
before
me
And
gasping
to
begin
some
speech
her
eyes
Became
two
spouts
the
fury
spent
anon
Did
this
break
from
her
Good
Antigonus
Since
fate
against
thy
better
disposition
Hath
made
thy
person
for
the
thrower
out
Of
my
poor
babe
according
to
thine
oath
Places
remote
enough
are
in
Bohemia
There
weep
and
leave
it
crying
and
for
the
babe
Is
counted
lost
for
ever
Perdita

For
this
ungentle
business
Put
on
thee
by
my
lord
thou
ne
er
shalt
see
Thy
wife
Paulina
more
so
with
shrieks
She
melted
into
air
Affrighted
much
I
did
in
time
collect
myself
and
thought
This
was
so
and
no
slumber
Dreams
are
toys
Yet
for
this
once
yea
superstitiously
I
will
be
squar

I
do
believe
Hermione
hath
suffer
d
death
and
that
Apollo

being
indeed

Of
King
Polixenes

be

Either

Of

Laying

There

Laying

Which

if
fortune

thee
pretty
And

The

Poor
wretch
That

To

Weep

A

And
then
for

to
see
how
the
bear
tore
out
his
shoulder

how
he
cried
to
me
for
help
and
said
his

Antigonus
a

both
joy
and
terror
Of
good
and
bad
that
makes
and
unfolds
error
Now
take
upon
me
in
the
name
of
Time
To
use
my
wings
Impute
it
not
a
crime
To
me
or
my
swift
passage
that
I
slide
O
er
sixteen
years
and
leave
the
growth
untried
Of
that
wide
gap
since
it
is
in
my

To

and
in
one

To

The
times
that

To

freshest

reigning
and
make
stale
The
glistering
of
this
present
as
my
tale
Now
seems
to
it
Your
patience
this
allowing
I
turn
my
glass
and
give
my
scene
such
growing
As
you
had
slept
between
Leontes
leaving
Th
effects
of
his
fond
jealousies
so
grieving
That
he
shuts
up
himself

Gentle
spectators
that
I
now
may
be
In

Bohemia

well
I
mention
d
a

Be

A

And
what

CAMILLO
POLIXENES
I
pray
thee
good
Camillo
be
no
more
importunate
tis
a
sickness
denying
thee
anything
a
death
to
grant
this
CAMILLO
It
is
fifteen
years
since
I
saw
my
country
though
I
have
for
the
most
part
been
aired
abroad
I
desire
to
lay
my
bones
there
Besides
the
penitent
King
my
master
hath
sent
for
me
to
whose
feeling
sorrows
I
might
be
some
allay
or
I
o
erween
to
think
so
which
is
another
spur
to
my
departure
POLIXENES
As
thou
lov
st
me
Camillo
wipe
not
out
the
rest
of
thy
services
by
leaving
me
now
The
need
I
have
of
thee
thine
own
goodness
hath
made
Better
not
to
have
had
thee
than
thus
to
want
thee
thou
having
made
me
businesses
which
none
without
thee
can
sufficiently
manage
must
either
stay
to
execute
them
thyself
or
take
away
with
thee
the
very
services
thou
hast
done
which
if
I
have
not
enough
considered
as
too
much
I
cannot
to
be
more
thankful
to
thee
shall
be
my
study
and
my
profit
therein
the
heaping
friendships
Of
that
fatal
country
Sicilia
prithee
speak
no
more
whose
very
naming
punishes
me
with
the
remembrance
of
that
penitent
as
thou
call
st
him
and
reconciled
king
my
brother
whose
loss
of
his
most
precious
queen
and
children
are
even
now
to
be
afresh
lamented
Say
to
me
when
saw
st
thou
the
Prince
Florizel
my
son
Kings
are
no
less
unhappy
their
issue
not
being
gracious
than
they
are
in
losing
them
when
they
have
approved
their
virtues
CAMILLO
Sir
it
is
three
days
since
I
saw
the
Prince
What
his
happier
affairs
may
be
are
to
me
unknown
but
I
have
missingly
noted
he
is
of
late
much
retired
from
court
and
is
less
frequent
to
his
princely
exercises
than
formerly
he
hath
appeared
POLIXENES
I
have
considered
so
much
Camillo
and
with
some
care
so
far
that
I
have
eyes
under
my
service
which
look
upon
his
removedness
from
whom
I
have
this
intelligence
that
he
is
seldom
from
the
house
of
a
most
homely
shepherd
a
man
they
say
that
from
very
nothing
and
beyond
the
imagination
of
his
neighbours
is
grown
into
an
unspeakable
estate
CAMILLO
I
have
heard
sir
of
such
a
man
who
hath
a
daughter
of
most
rare
note
The
report
of
her
is
extended
more
than
can
be
thought
to
begin
from
such
a
cottage
POLIXENES
That
s
likewise
part
of
my
intelligence
but
I
fear
the
angle
that
plucks
our
son
thither
Thou
shalt
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
we
will
not
appearing
what
we
are
have
some
question
with
the
shepherd
from
whose
simplicity
I
think
it
not
uneasy
to
get
the
cause
of
my
son
s
resort
thither
Prithee
be
my
present
partner
in
this
business
and
lay
aside
the
thoughts
of
Sicilia
CAMILLO
I
willingly
obey
your
command
POLIXENES
My
best
Camillo
We
must
disguise
ourselves

cottage
Enter
AUTOLYCUS
singing
When
daffodils
begin
to
peer
With
heigh
the
doxy
over
the
dale
Why
then
comes
in
the
sweet
o
the
year
For
the
red
blood
reigns
in
the
winter
s
pale
The
white
sheet
bleaching
on
the
hedge
With
heigh
the
sweet
birds
O
how
they
sing
Doth
set
my
pugging
tooth
on
edge
For
a
quart
of
ale
is
a
dish
for
a
king
The
lark
that
tirra
lirra
chants
With
heigh
with
heigh
the
thrush
and
the
jay
Are
summer
songs
for
me
and
my
aunts
While
we
lie
tumbling
in

hay
I

The

And
when

do
most
go

If

And
bear

Then

I

And

Gallows

O

Alas

A

I
knew
him
once
a
servant
of
the
Prince
I
cannot
tell
good
sir
for
which
of
his
virtues
it
was
but
he
was
certainly
whipt
out
of
the
court
CLOWN
His
vices
you
would
say
there

no

out

They
