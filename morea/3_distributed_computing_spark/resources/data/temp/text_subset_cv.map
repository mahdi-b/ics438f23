The

Call

Lord
Ponton

For
him
was
I
exchang

ransomed
But
with
a
baser
man
of

by
far
Once
in
contempt
they

O

the
terror
of

The
scarecrow
that
affrights

Then
broke
I
from
the
officers
that
led
me
And
with
my
nails
digg
d
stones
out
of
the
ground
To
hurl
at
the
beholders
of
my
shame
My
grisly
countenance
made
others
fly
None
durst
come
near
for
fear
of
sudden
death
In
iron
walls
they
deem
d
me
not
secure
So
great
fear
of
my
name
mongst
them
was
spread
That
they
suppos
d
I
could
rend
bars
of
steel
And
spurn
in

posts
of
adamant
Wherefore
a
guard
of
chosen
shot
I
had
That
walk

about

Coward
of

Ascend

Not

guess
That

make

ways
That
if

of

do
fail
The

yet

At

I
still
prevail
Or
will

blame

so
was
mine

And
for
myself
most
part
of

this

Within
her
quarter
and
mine
own
precinct
I
was
employ
d
in
passing
to

fro
About
relieving
of
the
sentinels
Then
how
or
which
way
should
they
first
break
in
PUCELLE
Question
my
lords
no
further
of
the
case
How
or
which
way
tis
sure
they
found
some
place
But
weakly
guarded
where
the
breach
was
made
And
now
there
rests
no
other

SOLDIER
I

be
so
bold
to
take
what
they
have
left
The
cry
of
Talbot
serves
me
for

For
I
have
loaden

with
many
spoils
Using
no

BEDFORD
The

Whose

Here

Retreat

TALBOT
Bring
forth
the
body
of
old
Salisbury
And
here
advance
it
in
the
market
place
The
middle
centre
of
this
cursed
town
Now
have
I
paid
my
vow
unto
his
soul
For
every
drop
of
blood
was
drawn
from
him
There
hath
at
least
five
Frenchmen
died
to
night
And
that
hereafter
ages
may
behold
What
ruin
happened
in
revenge
of
him
Within
their
chiefest
temple
I
ll
erect
A
tomb
wherein
his
corpse
shall
be
interr
d
Upon
the
which
that
every
one
may
read
Shall
be
engrav
d
the
sack
of
Orleans
The
treacherous
manner
of
his
mournful
death
And
what
a
terror
he
had
been
to
France
But
lords
in
all
our
bloody
massacre
I
muse
we
met
not
with
the
Dauphin
s
grace
His
new
come
champion
virtuous
Joan
of
Arc
Nor
any
of
his
false
confederates

Tis
thought
Lord
Talbot
when
the
fight
began
Rous

the
sudden
from
their
drowsy
beds
They
did
amongst
the
troops
of
armed
men
Leap

walls
for
refuge
in
the
field
BURGUNDY
Myself
as
far
as
I
could
well
discern
For
smoke
and
dusky
vapours
of
the
night
Am
sure
I
scar
d
the
Dauphin
and
his
trull
When
arm
in
arm
they
both
came
swiftly
running
Like
to
a
pair
of
loving
turtle
doves
That
could
not
live
asunder
day
or
night
After
that
things
are
set
in
order
here
We

them
with
all

Enter

That
she
may
boast

the
man
Whose
glory
fills
the
world
with
loud
report
BURGUNDY
Is
it
even
so
Nay
then
I
see
our
wars
Will
turn
into
a
peaceful
comic
sport
When
ladies
crave

encount
red

You

not
my

gentle
suit
TALBOT
Ne

Could

Yet

And

Will

No

Are

Well

PORTER
Madam
I
will
COUNTESS
The
plot
is
laid
if
all
things
fall
out
right
I
shall
as
famous
be
by
this
exploit
As
Scythian
Tomyris
by
Cyrus
death
Great
is
the
rumour
of
this
dreadful
knight
And
his
achievements
of
no
less
account
Fain
would
mine
eyes
be
witness
with
mine
ears
To
give
their
censure
of
these
rare
reports
Enter

By

come
COUNTESS
And
he
is
welcome
What
is
this
the
man
MESSENGER
Madam
it
is
COUNTESS
Is
this
the
scourge
of
France
Is
this
Talbot
so
much
fear
d
abroad
That
with
his
name
the
mothers
still
their
babes
I
see
report
is
fabulous
and
false
I
thought
I
should
have
seen
some
Hercules
A
second
Hector
for
his
grim
aspect
And
large
proportion
of
his
strong
knit
limbs
Alas
this
is
a
child
a
silly
dwarf
It
cannot
be
this
weak
and
writhled
shrimp
Should
strike
such
terror
to
his
enemies
TALBOT
Madam
I
have
been
bold
to
trouble
you
But
since
your
ladyship
is
not
at
leisure
I
ll
sort
some
other
time
to
visit
you
Going
COUNTESS
What
means
he
now
Go
ask
him
whither
he
goes
MESSENGER
Stay
my
Lord

for
my
lady
craves
To
know
the
cause
of
your
abrupt
departure

Marry
for
that

a
wrong
belief
I
go

With

If
thou
be

art
thou
prisoner
TALBOT
Prisoner
To
whom
COUNTESS
To
me
blood
thirsty
lord
And
for
that
cause
I
train
d
thee
to
my
house
Long
time
thy
shadow
hath
been
thrall
to
me
For
in
my
gallery
thy
picture
hangs
But
now
the
substance
shall
endure
the
like
And
I
will
chain
these
legs
and
arms
of
thine
That
hast
by
tyranny
these
many
years
Wasted
our
country
slain
our
citizens
And
sent
our
sons
and
husbands
captivate
TALBOT
Ha
ha
ha
COUNTESS
Laughest
thou
wretch
Thy
mirth
shall
turn
to
moan
TALBOT
I
laugh
to
see
your
ladyship
so
fond
To
think
that
you
have
aught
but
Talbot
s
shadow
Whereon
to
practise
your
severity
COUNTESS
Why
art
not
thou
the
man
TALBOT
I
am
indeed
COUNTESS
Then
have
I
substance
too
TALBOT
No
no
I
am
but
shadow
of
myself
You
are
deceiv
d
my
substance
is
not
here
For
what
you
see
is
but
the
smallest
part
And
least
proportion
of
humanity
I
tell
you
madam
were
the
whole
frame
here
It
is
of
such
a
spacious
lofty
pitch
Your
roof
were
not
sufficient
to
contain
t
COUNTESS
This
is
a
riddling
merchant
for
the
nonce
He
will
be
here
and
yet
he
is
not
here
How
can
these
contrarieties
agree
TALBOT
That
will
I
show
you
presently
Winds
his
horn
drums
strike
up
a
peal
of
ordnance
Enter
soldiers
How
say
you
madam
Are
you
now
persuaded
That
Talbot
is
but
shadow
of
himself
These
are
his
substance
sinews
arms
and
strength
With
which
he
yoketh
your
rebellious
necks
Razeth
your
cities
and
subverts
your
towns
And
in
a
moment
makes
them
desolate
COUNTESS
Victorious
Talbot
pardon
my
abuse
I
find
thou
art
no
less
than
fame
hath
bruited
And
more
than
may
be
gathered
by
thy
shape
Let
my
presumption
not
provoke
thy
wrath
For
I
am
sorry
that
with
reverence
I
did
not
entertain
thee
as
thou
art
TALBOT
Be
not
dismay
d
fair
lady
nor
misconster
The
mind
of
Talbot
as
you
did
mistake
The
outward
composition
of
his
body
What
you
have
done
hath
not
offended
me
