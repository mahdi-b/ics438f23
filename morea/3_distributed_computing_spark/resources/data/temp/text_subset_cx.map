KING

When

King

For

foes

EXETER
Ay
we
may
march
in
England
or
in
France
Not
seeing
what
is
likely
to
ensue
This
late
dissension
grown
betwixt
the
peers
Burns
under
feigned
ashes
of
forg
d
love
And
will
at
last
break
out
into
a
flame
As
fest
red
members
rot
but
by
degree
Till
bones
and
flesh
and
sinews
fall
away
So
will
this
base
and
envious
discord
breed
And
now
I
fear
that
fatal
prophecy
Which
in
the
time
of
Henry
nam
d
the
Fifth
Was
in
the
mouth
of
every
sucking
babe
That
Henry
born
at
Monmouth
should
win
all
And
Henry
born
at
Windsor
should
lose
all
Which
is
so
plain
that
Exeter
doth
wish
His
days
may
finish
ere
that
hapless
time

BURGUNDY
Courageous

Not

I

That

Pendragon

Came

I

are

SIR
JOHN
FASTOLFE
FASTOLFE
My
gracious
sovereign
as
I
rode
from
Calais
To
haste
unto
your
coronation
A
letter
was
deliver
d
to
my
hands
Writ
to
your
Grace
from
th
Duke
of
Burgundy
TALBOT
Shame
to
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
and
thee
I
vow
d
base
knight
when
I
did
meet
thee
next
To
tear
the
Garter
from
thy
craven
s
leg
Plucking
it
off
Which
I
have
done
because
unworthily
Thou
wast
installed
in
that
high
degree
Pardon
me
princely
Henry
and
the
rest
This
dastard
at
the
battle
of
Patay
When
but
in
all
I
was
six
thousand
strong
And
that
the
French
were
almost
ten
to
one
Before
we
met
or
that
a
stroke
was
given
Like
to
a
trusty
squire
did
run
away
In
which
assault
we
lost
twelve
hundred
men
Myself
and
divers
gentlemen
beside
Were
there
surpris
d
and
taken
prisoners
Then
judge
great
lords
if
I
have
done
amiss
Or
whether
that
such
cowards
ought
to
wear
This
ornament
of
knighthood
yea
or
no
GLOUCESTER
To
say
the
truth
this
fact
was
infamous
And
ill
beseeming
any
common
man
Much
more
a
knight
a
captain
and
a
leader
TALBOT
When
first
this
order
was
ordain
d
my
lords
Knights
of
the
Garter
were
of
noble
birth
Valiant
and
virtuous
full
of
haughty
courage
Such
as
were
grown
to
credit
by
the
wars
Not
fearing
death
nor
shrinking
for
distress
But
always
resolute
in
most
extremes
He
then
that
is
not
furnish
d
in
this
sort
Doth
but
usurp
the
sacred
name
of
knight
Profaning
this
most
honourable
order
And
should
if
I
were
worthy
to
be
judge
Be
quite
degraded
like
a
hedge
born
swain
That
doth
presume
to
boast
of
gentle
blood
KING
HENRY
Stain
to
thy
countrymen
thou
hear
st
thy
doom
Be
packing
therefore
thou
that
wast
a
knight
Henceforth
we
banish
thee
on
pain
of
death
Exit
FASTOLFE
And
now
my
Lord
Protector
view
the
letter
Sent
from
our
uncle
Duke
of
Burgundy
GLOUCESTER
Viewing
the
superscription
What
means
his
Grace
that
he
hath
chang
d
his
style
No
more
but
plain
and
bluntly
To
the
King
Hath
he
forgot
he
is
his
sovereign
Or
doth
this
churlish
superscription
Pretend
some
alteration
in
good
will
What
s
here
Reads
I
have
upon
especial
cause
Mov
d
with
compassion
of
my
country
s
wreck
Together
with
the
pitiful
complaints
Of
such
as
your
oppression
feeds
upon
Forsaken
your
pernicious
faction
And
join
d
with
Charles
the
rightful
King
of
France
O
monstrous
treachery
Can
this
be
so
That
in
alliance
amity
and
oaths
There
should
be
found
such
false
dissembling
guile
KING
HENRY
What
Doth
my
uncle
Burgundy
revolt
GLOUCESTER
He
doth
my
lord
and
is
become
your
foe
KING
HENRY
Is
that
the
worst
this
letter
doth
contain
GLOUCESTER
It
is
the
worst
and
all
my
lord
he
writes
KING
HENRY
Why
then
Lord
Talbot
there
shall
talk
with
him
And
give
him
chastisement
for
this
abuse
How
say
you
my
lord
are
you
not
content
TALBOT
Content
my
liege
Yes
but
that
I
am
prevented
I
should
have
begg
d
I
might
have
been
employ
d
KING
HENRY
Then
gather
strength
and
march
unto
him
straight
Let
him
perceive
how
ill
we
brook
his
treason
And
what
offence
it
is
to
flout
his
friends
TALBOT
I
go
my
lord
in
heart
desiring
still
You
may
behold
confusion
of
your
foes
Exit
Enter
VERNON
and
BASSET
VERNON
Grant
me
the
combat
gracious
sovereign
BASSET
And
me
my
lord
grant
me
the
combat
too

This
is

servant

him
noble
Prince
SOMERSET
And
this
is
mine
sweet
Henry
favour
him
KING
HENRY
Be
patient
lords
and
give
them
leave
to
speak
Say
gentlemen
what
makes
you
thus
exclaim
And
wherefore
crave
you
combat
or
with
whom
VERNON
With
him
my
lord
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
BASSET
And
I
with
him
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
KING
HENRY
What
is
that
wrong
whereof
you
both
complain
First
let
me
know
and
then
I
ll
answer
you
BASSET
Crossing
the
sea
from
England
into
France
This
fellow
here
with
envious
carping
tongue
Upbraided
me
about
the
rose
I
wear
Saying
the
sanguine
colour
of
the
leaves
Did
represent
my
master
s
blushing
cheeks
When
stubbornly
he
did
repugn
the
truth
About
a
certain
question
in
the
law
Argu
d
betwixt
the
Duke
of
York
and
him
With
other
vile
and
ignominious
terms
In
confutation
of
which
rude
reproach
And
in
defence
of
my
lord
s
worthiness
I
crave
the
benefit
of
law
of
arms
VERNON
And
that
is
my
petition
noble
lord
For
though
he
seem
with
forged
quaint
conceit
To
set
a
gloss
upon
his
bold
intent
Yet
know
my
lord
I
was
provok
d
by
him
And
he
first
took
exceptions
at
this
badge
Pronouncing
that
the
paleness
of
this
flower
Bewray
d
the
faintness
of
my
master
s
heart
YORK
Will
not
this
malice
Somerset
be
left
SOMERSET
Your
private
grudge
my
Lord
of
York
will
out
Though
ne
er
so
cunningly
you
smother
it
KING
HENRY
Good
Lord
what
madness
rules
in
brainsick
men
When
for
so
slight
and
frivolous
a
cause
Such
factious
emulations
shall
arise
Good
cousins
both
of
York
and
Somerset
Quiet
yourselves
I
pray
and
be
at
peace
YORK
Let
this
dissension
first
be
tried
by
fight
And
then
your
Highness
shall
command
a
peace
SOMERSET
The
quarrel
toucheth
none
but
us
alone
Betwixt
ourselves
let
us
decide
it
then
YORK
There
is
my
pledge
accept
it
Somerset
VERNON
Nay
let
it
rest
where
it
began
at
first
BASSET
Confirm
it
so
mine
honourable
lord
GLOUCESTER
Confirm
it
so
Confounded
be
your
strife
And
perish
ye
with
your
audacious
prate
Presumptuous
vassals
are
you
not
asham
d
With
this
immodest
clamorous
outrage
To
trouble
and
disturb
the
King
and
us
And
you
my
lords
methinks
you
do
not
well
To
bear
with
their
perverse
objections
Much
less
to
take
occasion
from
their
mouths
To
raise
a
mutiny
betwixt
yourselves
Let
me
persuade
you
take
a
better
course
EXETER
It
grieves
his
Highness
Good
my
lords
be
friends
KING
HENRY
Come
hither
you
that
would
be
combatants
Henceforth
I
charge
you
as
you
love
our
favour
Quite
to
forget
this
quarrel
and
the
cause
And
you
my
lords
remember
where
we
are
In
France
amongst
a
fickle
wavering
nation
If
they
perceive
dissension
in
our
looks
And
that
within
ourselves
we
disagree
