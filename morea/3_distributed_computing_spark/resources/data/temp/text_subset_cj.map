How
many
thousands
of
my
poorest
subjects
Are
at
this
hour
asleep
O
sleep
O
gentle
sleep
Nature
s
soft
nurse
how
have
I
frightened
thee
That
thou
no
more
will
weigh
my
eyelids
down
And
steep
my
senses
in
forgetfulness
Why
rather
sleep
liest
thou
in
smoky
cribs
Upon
uneasy
pallets
stretching
thee
And
hush
d
with
buzzing
night
flies
to
thy
slumber
Than
in
the
perfum
d
chambers
of
the
great
Under
the
canopies
of
costly
state
And
lull
d
with
sound
of
sweetest
melody
O
thou
dull
god
why
liest
thou
with
the
vile
In
loathsome
beds
and
leav
st
the
kingly
couch
A
watch
case
or
a
common
larum
bell
Wilt
thou
upon
the
high
and
giddy
mast
Seal
up
the
ship
boy
s
eyes
and
rock
his
brains
In
cradle
of
the
rude
imperious
surge
And
in
the
visitation
of
the
winds
Who
take
the
ruffian
billows
by
the
top
Curling
their
monstrous
heads
and
hanging
them
With
deafing
clamour
in
the
slippery
clouds
That
with
the
hurly
death
itself
awakes
Canst
thou
O
partial
sleep
give
thy
repose
To
the
wet
sea
boy
in
an
hour
so
rude
And
in
the
calmest
and
most
stillest
night
With
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
Deny
it
to
a
king
Then
happy
low
lie
down
Uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
crown

Many

Why

all
my
lords
Have
you
read
o
er
the
letters
that
I
sent

WARWICK
We
have
my
liege
KING
Then
you
perceive
the
body
of
our
kingdom
How
foul
it
is
what
rank
diseases
grow
And
with
what
danger
near
the
heart
of
it
WARWICK
It
is
but
as
a
body
yet
distempered
Which
to
his
former
strength
may
be
restored
With
good
advice
and
little
medicine
My
Lord
Northumberland
will
soon
be
cool
d
KING
O
God
that
one
might
read
the
book
of
fate
And
see
the
revolution
of
the
times
Make
mountains
level
and
the
continent
Weary
of
solid
firmness
melt
itself
Into
the
sea
and
other
times
to
see
The
beachy
girdle
of
the
ocean
Too
wide
for
Neptune
s
hips
how
chances
mock
And
changes
fill
the
cup
of
alteration
With
divers
liquors
O
if
this
were
seen
The
happiest
youth
viewing
his
progress
through
What
perils
past
what
crosses
to
ensue
Would
shut
the
book
and
sit
him
down
and
die
Tis
not
ten
years
gone
Since
Richard
and
Northumberland
great
friends
Did
feast
together
and
in
two
years
after
Were
they
at
wars
It
is
but
eight
years
since
This
Percy
was
the
man
nearest
my
soul
Who
like
a
brother
toil
d
in
my
affairs
And
laid
his
love
and
life
under
my
foot
Yea
for
my
sake
even
to
the
eyes
of
Richard
Gave
him
defiance
But
which
of
you
was
by
To
WARWICK
You
cousin
Nevil
as
I
may
remember
When
Richard
with
his
eye
brim
full
of
tears
Then
check
d
and
rated
by
Northumberland
Did
speak
these
words
now
prov
d
a
prophecy
Northumberland
thou
ladder
by
the
which
My
cousin
Bolingbroke
ascends
my
throne
Though
then
God
knows
I
had
no
such
intent
But
that
necessity
so
bow
d
the
state
That
I
and
greatness
were
compell
d
to
kiss
The
time
shall
come
thus
did
he
follow
it
The
time
will
come
that
foul
sin
gathering
head
Shall
break
into
corruption
so
went
on
Foretelling
this
same
time
s
condition
And
the
division
of
our
amity
WARWICK
There
is
a
history
in
all
men
s
lives
Figuring
the
natures
of
the
times
deceas
d
The
which
observ
d
a
man
may
prophesy
With
a
near
aim
of
the
main
chance
of
things
As
yet
not
come
to
life
who
in
their
seeds
And
weak
beginning
lie
intreasured
Such
things
become
the
hatch
and
brood
of
time
And
by
the
necessary
form
of
this
King
Richard
might
create
a
perfect
guess
That
great
Northumberland
then
false
to
him
Would
of
that
seed
grow
to
a
greater
falseness
Which
should
not
find
a
ground
to
root
upon
Unless
on
you
KING
Are
these
things
then
necessities
Then
let
us
meet
them
like
necessities
And
that
same
word
even
now
cries
out
on
us
They
say
the
Bishop
and
Northumberland
Are
fifty
thousand
strong
WARWICK
It
cannot
be
my
lord
Rumour
doth
double
like
the
voice
and
echo
The
numbers
of
the
feared
Please

your
Grace
To
go
to

Upon
my
soul
my
lord
The
powers
that
you
already
have
sent
forth
Shall

To
