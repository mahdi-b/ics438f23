Tis
such

That
creep
like
shadows
by

do
sigh
At
each
his
needless
heavings
such

you
Nourish

I
Do
come

Honest

That

What

PAULINA
No
noise
my

needful
conference
About

for
your

LEONTES
How
Away
with

audacious
lady
Antigonus
I
charg
d
thee
that
she
should
not

I
knew

ANTIGONUS
I
told
her
so
my

On

She
should

LEONTES
What
canst
not

From

Unless

course
that
you
have
done
Commit
me
for
committing
honour
trust
it
He
shall
not
rule
me
ANTIGONUS
La
you
now
you

When

run
But

PAULINA
Good
my

And
I

Myself
your
loyal

your
physician
Your
most
obedient
counsellor
yet
that
dares
Less
appear
so
in
comforting
your
evils
Than
such

From

Queen
LEONTES
Good

PAULINA
Good

Force

PAULINA
Let

trifles
of

First
hand

On
mine
own
accord
I

But
first
I

do
my
errand
The
good
Queen
For

brought
you
forth
a

Here

Laying

PAULINA
Not
so
I
am
as
ignorant
in
that
as
you
In
so
entitling
me
and
no
less
honest
Than
you
are
mad
which
is
enough
I
ll
warrant
As
this
world
goes
to
pass
for
honest
LEONTES
Traitors
Will
you
not
push
her
out
Give

For

Which

So

You

His

Whose
sting

sharper

For
as
the

now
stands
it
is
a
curse
He
cannot
be

The
root

rotten
As

A

Of
boundless

who

And
now

The

Not

But
this
most
cruel
usage
of
your
Queen
Not
able
to
produce
more
accusation
Than
your

something
savours
Of

Yea
scandalous

Out

The

delicate
the
air
most
sweet
Fertile
the

the
temple
much
surpassing
The
common
praise
it
bears
DION
I
shall
report
For
most
it
caught
me
the
celestial
habits
Methinks
I
so
should
term
them
and
the
reverence
Of
the
grave
wearers
O
the
sacrifice
How
ceremonious
solemn
and
unearthly
It
was
i
th
off
ring
CLEOMENES
But
of
all
the
burst
And
the
ear
deaf
ning
voice
o
th
oracle
Kin
to

so
surpris
d
my
sense
That
I
was

If

journey
Prove
as
successful
to
the
Queen
O
be
t
so
As
it

rare
pleasant
speedy
The

worth

CLEOMENES
Great
Apollo
Turn
all
to
th
best
These
proclamations
So
forcing
faults
upon
Hermione
I
little
like
DION
The
violent
carriage
of
it
Will
clear
or
end
the
business
When
the
oracle
Thus
by
Apollo
s
great
divine
seal
d
up
Shall
the
contents
discover
something
rare
Even
then
will
rush
to

Go

and
The
testimony
on
my
part
no
other
But
what
comes
from
myself
it
shall
scarce
boot
me
To
say
Not
guilty
Mine
integrity
Being
counted
falsehood
shall
as
I
express
it
Be
so
receiv

But
thus
if
pow
rs
divine
Behold
our
human
actions
as
they
do
I
doubt
not
then
but
innocence
shall
make
False
accusation
blush
and
tyranny
Tremble
at
patience
You
my
lord
best
know
Who
least
will
seem
to
do
so
my
past
life
Hath
been
as
continent
as
chaste
as
true
As
I
am
now
unhappy
which
is
more
Than
history
can
pattern
though
devis
d
And
play
d
to
take
spectators
for
behold
me
A
fellow
of
the
royal
bed
which
owe
A
moiety
of
the
throne
a
great
king
s
daughter
The
mother
to
a
hopeful
prince
here
standing
To
prate
and
talk
for
life
and
honour
fore
Who
please
to
come
and
hear
For
life
I
prize
it
As
I
weigh
grief
which
I
would
spare
for
honour
Tis
a
derivative
from
me
to
mine
And
only
that
I
stand
for
I
appeal
To
your
own
conscience
sir
before
Polixenes
Came
to
your
court
how
I
was
in
your
grace
How
merited
to
be
so
since
he
came
With
what
encounter
so
uncurrent
I
Have
strain
d
t
appear
thus
if
one
jot
beyond
The
bound
of
honour
or
in
act
or
will
That
way
inclining
hard
ned
be
the
hearts
Of
all
that
hear
me
and
my
near
st
of
kin
Cry
fie
upon
my
grave
LEONTES
I
ne
er
heard
yet
That
any
of
these
bolder
vices
wanted
Less
impudence
to
gainsay
what
they
did
Than
to
perform
it
first
HERMIONE
That
s
true
enough
Though
tis
a
saying
sir
not
due
to
me
LEONTES
You
will
not
own
it
HERMIONE
More
than
mistress
of
Which
comes
to
me
in
name
of
fault
I
must
not
At
all
acknowledge
For
Polixenes
With
whom
I
am
accus
d
I
do
confess
I
lov
d
him
as
in
honour
he
requir
d
With
such
a
kind
of
love
as
might
become
A
lady
like
me
with
a
love
even
such
So
and
no
other
as
yourself
commanded
Which
not
to
have
done
I
think
had
been
in
me
Both
disobedience
and
ingratitude
To
you
and
toward
your
friend
whose
love
had
spoke
Ever
since
it
could
speak
from
an
infant
freely
That
it
was
yours
Now
for
conspiracy
I
know
not
how
it
tastes
though
it
be
dish
d
For
me
to
try
how
all
I
know
of
it
Is
that
Camillo
was
an
honest
man
And
why
he
left
your
court
the
gods
themselves
Wotting
no
more
than
I
are
ignorant
LEONTES
You
knew
of
his
departure
as
you
know
What
you
have
underta
en
to
do
in
s
absence
HERMIONE
Sir
You
speak
a
language
that
I
understand
not
My
life
stands
in
the
level
of
your
dreams
Which
I
ll
lay
down
LEONTES
Your
actions
are
my
dreams
You
had
a
bastard
by
Polixenes
And
I
but
dream
d
it
As
you
were
past
all
shame
Those
of
your
fact
are
so
so
past
all
truth
Which
to
deny
concerns
more
than
avails
for
as
Thy
brat
hath
been
cast
out
like
to
itself
No
father
owning
it
which
is
indeed
More
criminal
in
thee
than
it
so
thou
Shalt
feel
our
justice
in
whose
easiest
passage
Look
for
no
less
than
death
HERMIONE
Sir
spare
your
threats
The
bug
which
you
would
fright
me
with
I
seek
To
me
can
life
be
no
commodity
The
crown
and
comfort
of
my
life
your
favour
I
do
give
lost
for
I
do
feel
it
gone
But
know
not
how
it
went
my
second
joy
And
first
fruits
of
my
body
from
his
presence
I
am
barr
d
like
one
infectious
my
third
comfort
Starr
d
most
unluckily
is
from
my
breast
The
innocent
milk
in
it
most
innocent
mouth
Hal
d
out
to
murder

on

Proclaim
d
a

immodest
hatred
The
child

privilege
denied
which
longs
To
women
of
all
fashion
lastly
hurried
Here
to
this
place
i
th
open
air
before
I
have
got
strength
of
limit
Now
my
liege
Tell
me
what
blessings
I
have
here
alive
That
I
should
fear
to
die
Therefore
proceed
But
yet
hear
this
mistake
me
not
no
life
I
prize
it
not
a
straw
but
for
mine
honour
Which
I
would
free
if
I
shall
be

d
Upon
surmises

But
what
your
jealousies
awake
I
tell
you
Tis
rigour
and
not
law
Your
honours
all
I
do
refer
me
to
