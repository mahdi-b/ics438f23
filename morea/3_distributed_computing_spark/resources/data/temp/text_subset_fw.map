Out
of
myself
press
me
to
death
with
wit
Therefore
let
Benedick
like
cover
d
fire
Consume
away
in
sighs
waste
inwardly
It
were
a
better
death
than
die
with
mocks
Which
is
as
bad
as
die
with
tickling
Urs
Yet
tell
her
of
it
Hear
what
she
will
say
Hero
No
rather
I
will
go
to
Benedick
And
counsel
him
to
fight
against
his
passion
And
truly
I
ll
devise
some
honest
slanders
To
stain
my
cousin
with
One
doth
not
know
How
much
an
ill
word
may
empoison
liking
Urs
O
do
not
do
your
cousin
such
a
wrong
She
cannot
be
so
much
without
true
judgment
Having
so
swift
and
excellent
a
wit
As
she
is
priz
d
to
have
as
to
refuse
So
rare
a
gentleman
as
Signior
Benedick
Hero
He
is
the
only
man
of
Italy
Always
excepted
my
dear
Claudio
Urs
I
pray
you
be
not
angry
with
me
madam
Speaking
my
fancy
Signior
Benedick
For
shape
for
bearing
argument
and
valour
Goes
foremost
in
report
through
Italy
Hero
Indeed
he
hath
an
excellent
good
name
Urs
His
excellence
did
earn
it
ere
he
had
it
When
are
you
married
madam
Hero
Why
every
day
to
morrow
Come
go
in
I
ll
show
thee
some
attires
and
have
thy
counsel
Which
is
the
best
to
furnish
me
to
morrow
They

warrant
you
We
have
caught
her

If
it

so
then
loving
goes
by

Some

kills
with
arrows
some
with

Exeunt
Hero
and
Ursula
Beatrice

from
the
arbour
Beat
What
fire
is
in

ears
Can
this

Stand

Contempt

No

I
will
requite
thee
Taming
my
wild
heart
to
thy
loving
hand
If
thou

love
my
kindness
shall
incite
thee
To
bind
our
loves
up

For

Exit
Scene
II
A
room
in
Leonato
s
house
Enter
Don
Pedro
Claudio
Benedick
and
Leonato
Pedro
I
do
but
stay
till
your
marriage
be
consummate
and
then
go
I
toward
Arragon
Claud
I
ll
bring
you
thither
my
lord
if
you
ll
vouchsafe
me
Pedro
Nay
that
would
be
as
great
a
soil
in
the
new
gloss
of
your
marriage
as
to
show
a
child
his
new
coat
and
forbid
him
to
wear
it
I
will
only
be
bold
with
Benedick
for
his
company
for
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
he
is
all
mirth
He
hath
twice
or
thrice
cut
Cupid
s
bowstring
and
the
little
hangman
dare
not
shoot
at
him
He
hath
a
heart
as
sound
as
a
bell
and
his
tongue
is
the
clapper
for
what
his
heart
thinks
his
tongue
speaks
Bene
Gallants
I
am
not
as
I
have
been
Leon
So
say
I
Methinks
you
are
sadder
Claud
I
hope
he
be
in
love
Pedro
Hang
him
truant
There
s
no
true
drop
of
blood
in
him
to
be
truly
touch
d
with
love
If
he
be
sad
he
wants
money
Bene
I
have
the
toothache
Pedro
Draw
it
Bene
Hang
it
Claud
You
must
hang
it
first
and
draw
it
afterwards
Pedro
What
sigh
for
the
toothache
Leon
Where
is
but
a
humour
or
a
worm
Bene
Well
every
one
can
master
a
grief
but
he
that
has
it
Claud
Yet
say
I
he
is
in
love
Pedro
There
is
no
appearance
of
fancy
in
him
unless
it
be
a
fancy
that
he
hath
to
strange
disguises
as
to
be
a
Dutchman
to
day
a
Frenchman
to
morrow
or
in
the
shape
of
two
countries
at
once
as
a
German
from
the
waist
downward
all
slops
and
a
Spaniard
from
the
hip
upward
no
doublet
Unless
he
have
a
fancy
to
this
foolery
as
it
appears
he
hath
he
is
no
fool
for
fancy
as
you
would
have
it
appear
he
is
Claud
If
he
be
not
in
love
with
some
woman
there
is
no
believing
old
signs
A
brushes
his
hat
o
mornings
What
should
that
bode
Pedro
Hath
any
man
seen
him
at
the
barber
s
Claud
No
but
the
barber
s
man
hath
been
seen
with
him
and
the
old
ornament
of
his
cheek
hath
already
stuff
d
tennis
balls
Leon
Indeed
he
looks
younger
than
he
did
by
the
loss
of
a
beard
Pedro
Nay
a
rubs
himself
with
civet
Can
you
smell
him
out
by
that
Claud
That
s
as
much
as
to
say
the
sweet
youth
s
in
love
Pedro
The
greatest
note
of
it
is
his
melancholy
Claud
And
when
was
he
wont
to
wash
his
face
Pedro
Yea
or
to
paint
himself
for
the
which
I
hear
what
they
say
of
him
Claud
Nay
but
his
jesting
spirit
which
is
new
crept
into
a
lutestring
and
now
govern
d
by
stops
Pedro
Indeed
that
tells
a
heavy
tale
for
him
Conclude
conclude
he
is
in
love
Claud
Nay
but
I
know
who
loves
him
Pedro
That
would
I
know
too
I
warrant
one
that
knows
him
not
Claud
Yes
and
his
ill
conditions
and
in
despite
of
all
dies
for
him
Pedro
She
shall
be
buried
with
her
face
upwards
Bene
Yet
is
this
no
charm
for
the
toothache
Old
signior
walk
aside
with
me
I
have
studied
eight
or
nine
wise
words
to
speak
to
you
which
these
hobby
horses
must
not
hear
Exeunt
Benedick
and
Leonato
Pedro
For
my
life
to
break
with
him
about
Beatrice
Claud
Tis
even
so
Hero
and
Margaret
have
by
this
played
their
parts
with
Beatrice
and
then
the
two
bears
will
not
bite
one
another
when
they
meet
Enter
John
the
Bastard
John
My
lord
and
brother
God
save
you
Pedro
Good
den
brother
John
If
your
leisure
serv
d
I
would
speak
with
you
Pedro
In
private
John
If
it
please
you
Yet
Count
Claudio
may
hear
for
what
I
would
speak
of
concerns
him
Pedro
What
s
the
matter
John
to
Claudio
Means
your
lordship
to
be
married
tomorrow
Pedro
You
know
he
does
John
I
know
not
that
when
he
knows
what
I
know
Claud
If
there
be
any
impediment
I
pray
you
discover
it
John
You
may
think
I
love
you
not
Let
that
appear
hereafter
and
aim
better
at
me
by
that
I
now
will
manifest
For
my
brother
I
think
he
holds
you
well
and
in
dearness
of
heart
hath
holp
to
effect
your
ensuing
marriage
surely
suit
ill
spent
and
labour
ill
bestowed
Pedro
Why
what
s
the
matter
John
I
came
hither
to
tell
you
and
circumstances
short
ned
for
she
has
been
too
long
a
talking
of
the
lady
is
disloyal
Claud
Who
Hero
John
Even
she
Leonato
s
Hero
your
Hero
every
man
s
Hero
Claud
Disloyal
John
The
word
is
too
good
to
paint
out
her
wickedness
I
could
say
she
were
worse
think
you
of
a
worse
title
and
I
will
fit
her
to
it
Wonder
not
till
further
warrant
Go
but
with
me
to
night
you
shall
see
her
chamber
window
ent
red
even
the
night
before
her
wedding
day
If
you
love
her
then
to
morrow
wed
her
But
it
would
better
fit
your
honour
to
change
your
mind
Claud
May
this
be
so
Pedro
I
will
not
think
it
John
If
you
dare
not
trust
that
you
see
confess
not
that
you
know
If
you
will
follow
me
I
will
show
you
enough
and
when
you
have
seen
more
and
heard
more
proceed
accordingly
Claud
If
I
see
anything
to
night
why
I
should
not
marry
her
to
morrow
in
the
congregation
where
I
should
wed
there
will
I
shame
her
Pedro
And
as
I
wooed
for
thee
to
obtain
her
I
will
join
with
thee
to
disgrace
her
John
I
will
disparage
her
no
farther
till
you
are
my
witnesses
Bear
it
coldly
but
till
midnight
and
let
the
issue
show
itself
Pedro
O
day
untowardly
turned
Claud
O
mischief
strangely
thwarting
John
O
plague
right
well
prevented
So
will
you
say
when
you
have
seen
the
Sequel
Exeunt
Scene
III
A
street
Enter
Dogberry
and
his
compartner
Verges
with
the
Watch
Dog
Are
you
good
men
and
true
Verg
Yea
or
else
it
were
pity
but
they
should
suffer
salvation
body
and
soul
Dog
Nay
that
were
a
punishment
too
good
for
them
if
they
should
have
any
allegiance
in
them
being
chosen
for
the
Prince
s
watch
Verg
Well
give
them
their
charge
neighbour
Dogberry
Dog
First
who
think
you
the
most
desartless
man
to
be
constable
1
Watch
Hugh
Oatcake
sir
or
George
Seacoal
for
they
can
write
and
read
Dog
Come
hither
neighbour
Seacoal
God
hath
bless
d
you
with
a
good
name
To
be
a
well
favoured
man
is
the
gift
of
fortune
but
to
write
and
read
comes
by
nature
2
Watch
Both
which
Master
Constable
Dog
You
have
I
knew
it
would
be
your
answer
Well
for
your
favour
sir
why
give
God
thanks
and
make
no
boast
of
it
and
for
your
writing
and
reading
let
that
appear
when
there
is
no
need
of
such
vanity
You
are
thought
here
to
be
the
most
senseless
and
fit
man
for
the
constable
of
the
watch
Therefore
bear
you
the
lanthorn
This
is
your
charge
you
shall
comprehend
all
vagrom
men
you
are
to
bid
any
man
stand
in
the
Prince
s
name
2
Watch
How
if
a
will
not
stand
Dog
Why
then
take
no
note
of
him
but
let
him
go
and
presently
call
the
rest
of
the
watch
together
and
thank
God
you
are
rid
of
a
knave
Verg
If
he
will
not
stand
when
he
is
bidden
he
is
none
of
the
Prince
s
subjects
Dog
True
and
they
are
to
meddle
with
none
but
the
Prince
s
subjects
You
shall
also
make
no
noise
in
the
streets
for
for
the
watch
to
babble
and
to
talk
is
most
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
2
Watch
We
will
rather
sleep
than
talk
We
know
what
belongs
to
a
watch
Dog
Why
you
speak
like
an
ancient
and
most
quiet
watchman
for
I
cannot
see
how
sleeping
should
offend
Only
have
a
care
that
your
bills
be
not
stol
n
Well
you
are
to
call
at
all
the
alehouses
and
bid
those
that
are
drunk
get
them
to
bed
2
Watch
How
if
they
will
not
Dog
Why
then
let
them
alone
till
they
are
sober
If
they
make
you
not
then
the
better
answer
You
may
say
they
are
not
the
men
you
took
them
for
2
Watch
Well
sir
Dog
If
you
meet
a
thief
you
may
suspect
him
by
virtue
of
your
office
to
be
no
true
man
and
for
such
kind
of
men
the
less
you
meddle
or
make
with
them
why
the
more
your
honesty
2
Watch
If
we
know
him
to
be
a
thief
shall
we
not
lay
hands
on
him
Dog
Truly
by
your
office
you
may
but
I
think
they
that
touch
pitch
will
be
defil
d
The
most
peaceable
way
for
you
if
you
do
take
a
thief
is
to
let
him
show
himself
what
he
is
and
steal
out
of
your
company
Verg
You
have
been
always
called
a
merciful
man
partner
Dog
Truly
I
would
not
hang
a
dog
by
my
will
much
more
a
man
who
hath
any
honesty
in
him
Verg
If
you
hear
a
child
cry
in
the
night
you
must
call
to
the
nurse
and
bid
her
still
it
2
Watch
How
if
the
nurse
be
asleep
and
will
not
hear
us
Dog
Why
then
depart
in
peace
and
let
the
child
wake
her
with
crying
for
the
ewe
that
will
not
hear
her
lamb
when
it
baes
will
never
answer
a
calf
when
he
bleats
Verg
Tis
very
true
Dog
This
is
the
end
of
the
charge
you
constable
are
to
present
the
Prince
s
own
person
If
you
meet
the
Prince
in
the
night
you
may
stay
him
Verg
Nay
by
r
lady
that
I
think
a
cannot
Dog
Five
shillings
to
one
on
t
with
any
man
that
knows
the
statutes
he
may
stay
him
Marry
not
without
the
Prince
be
willing
for
indeed
the
watch
ought
to
offend
no
man
and
it
is
an
offence
to
stay
a
man
against
his
will
Verg
By
r
lady
I
think
it
be
so
Dog
Ha
ah
ha
Well
masters
good
night
An

be
any
matter
of
weight
chances
call
up

Keep
your
fellows

Come

2
Watch
Well
masters
we
hear
our
charge
Let
us
go
sit
here
upon
the
church
bench
till
two
and
then
all
to

One
word
more
honest
neighbours
I
pray
you
watch
about
Signior
Leonato

door
for
the
wedding
being
there
tomorrow
there
is

I
will
owe
thee
an
answer
for
that

now
forward
with
thy
tale
Bora
Stand
thee
close
then
under
this
penthouse
for
it
drizzles
rain
and
I
will
like
a
true
drunkard
utter
all
to
thee

Watch

Some

masters
Yet
stand
close

Therefore

I
have
earned
of
Don
John
a
thousand
ducats
Con
Is
it
possible
that
any
villany
should
be
so
dear
Bora
Thou
shouldst
rather
ask
if
it
were
possible
any
villany
should
be
so
rich
for
when
rich
villains
have
need
of
poor
ones
poor
ones
may
make
what
price
they
will

I
wonder
at
it

shows
thou
art
unconfirm

Thou
knowest
that
the
fashion
of
a
doublet
or
a
hat
or

cloak
is
nothing
to

Yes
it
is
apparel
Bora
I
mean
the
fashion
Con
Yes
the
fashion
is
the
fashion
Bora
Tush
I
may
as
well
say
the
fool
s
the
fool
But
seest
thou
not
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
2
Watch
aside
I
know
that
Deformed
A
bas
been
a
vile
thief
this
seven
year
a
goes
up
and
down
like
a
gentleman
I
remember
his
name
Bora
Didst
thou
not
hear
somebody
Con
No
twas
the
vane
on
the
house
Bora
Seest
thou
not
I
say
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
how
giddily
a
turns
about
all
the
hot
bloods
between
fourteen
and
five
and
thirty
sometimes
fashioning
them
like
Pharaoh
s
soldiers
in
the
reechy
painting
sometime
like
god
Bel
s
priests
in
the
old
church
window
sometime
like
the
shaven
Hercules
in
the
smirch
d
worm
eaten
tapestry
where
his
codpiece
seems
as
massy
as
his
club
Con
All
this
I
see
and
I
see
that
the
fashion
wears
out
more
apparel
than
the
man
But
art
not
thou
thyself
giddy
with
the
fashion
too
that
thou
hast
shifted
out
of
thy
tale
into
telling
me
of
the
fashion
Bora
Not
so
neither
But
know
that
I
have
to
night
wooed
Margaret
the
Lady
Hero
s
gentlewoman
by
the
name
of
Hero
She
leans
me
out
at
her
mistress
chamber
window
bids
me
a
thousand
times
good
night
I
tell
this
tale
vilely
I
should
first
tell
thee
how
the
Prince
Claudio
and
my
master
planted
and
placed
and
possessed
by
my
master
Don
John
saw
afar
off
in
the
orchard
this
amiable
encounter
Con
And
thought
they
Margaret
was
Hero
Bora
Two
of
them
did
the
Prince
and
Claudio
but
the
devil
my
master
knew
she
was
Margaret
and
partly
by
his
oaths
which
first
possess
d
them
partly
by
the

Claudio
Benedick
Hero
Beatrice
and
Attendants
Leon
Come
Friar
Francis
be
brief
Only
to
the
plain
form
of
marriage
and
you
shall
recount
their
particular
duties
afterwards
Friar
You
come
hither
my
lord
to
marry
this
lady
Claud
No
Leon
To
be
married
to
her
Friar
you
come
to
marry
her
Friar
Lady
you
come
hither
to
be
married
to
this
count
Hero
I
do
Friar
If
either
of
you
know
any
inward
impediment
why
you
should
not
be
conjoined
I
charge
you
on
your
souls
to
utter
it
Claud
Know
you
any
Hero
Hero
None
my
lord
Friar
Know
you
any
Count
Leon
I
dare
make
his
answer
none
Claud
O
what
men
dare
do
what
men
may
do
what
men
daily
do
not
knowing
what
they
do
Bene
How
now
interjections
Why
then
some
be
of
laughing
as
ah
ha
he
Claud
Stand
thee
by
friar
Father
by
your
leave
Will
you
with
free
and
unconstrained
soul
Give
me
this
maid
your
daughter
Leon
As
freely
son
as
God
did
give
her
me
Claud
And
what
have
I
to
give
you
back
whose
worth
May
counterpoise
this
rich
and
precious
gift
Pedro
Nothing
unless
you
render
her
again
Claud
Sweet
Prince
you
learn
me
noble
thankfulness
There
Leonato
take
her
back
again
Give
not
this
rotten
orange
to
your
friend
She
s
but
the
sign
and
semblance
of
her
honour
Behold
how
like
a
maid
she
blushes
here
O
what
authority
and
show
of
truth
Can
cunning
sin
cover
itself
withal
Comes
not
that
blood
as
modest
evidence
To
witness
simple
virtue
Would
you
not
swear
All
you
that
see
her
that
she
were
a
maid
By
these
exterior
shows
But
she
is
none
She
knows
the
heat
of
a
luxurious
bed
