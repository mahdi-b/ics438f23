Both

Would

At

On

and

With

took
to
quench

She
would
to
each

You
are
retired
As
if
you
were
a
feasted
one
and
not
The
hostess
of
the
meeting
Pray
you
bid
These
unknown
friends
to

welcome
for
it
is
A
way
to
make

better
friends
more
known
Come

are
Mistress
o

Feast
Come

And

To

Sir
welcome
It

The

ship
o

To
CAMILLO
You

welcome
sir
Give
me
those
flow

there
Dorcas
Reverend
sirs
For
you
there
s
rosemary
and

these
keep
Seeming
and
savour
all
the
winter
long
Grace
and

be
to
you

And
welcome
to
our

POLIXENES
Shepherdess
A
fair
one
are
you
well
you
fit
our
ages
With
flow
rs
of
winter
PERDITA
Sir
the
year
growing
ancient
Not
yet
on
summer
s
death
nor
on
the
birth
Of
trembling
winter
the
fairest
flow
rs
o
th
season
Are
our
carnations
and
streak
d
gillyvors
Which
some
call
nature
s
bastards
Of
that
kind
Our
rustic
garden
s
barren
and
I
care
not
To
get
slips
of
them
POLIXENES
Wherefore
gentle
maiden
Do
you
neglect
them
PERDITA
For
I
have
heard
it
said
There
is
an
art
which
in
their
piedness
shares
With
great
creating
nature
POLIXENES
Say
there
be
Yet
nature
is
made
better
by
no
mean
But
nature
makes
that
mean
so
over
that
art
Which
you
say
adds
to
nature
is
an
art
That
nature
makes
You
see
sweet
maid
we
marry
A
gentler
scion
to
the
wildest
stock
And
make
conceive
a
bark
of
baser
kind
By
bud
of
nobler
race
This
is
an
art
Which
does
mend
nature
change
it
rather
but
The
art
itself
is
nature
PERDITA
So
it
is
POLIXENES
Then
make
your
garden
rich
in
gillyvors
And
do
not
call
them
bastards
PERDITA
I
ll
not
put
The
dibble
in
earth
to
set
one
slip
of
them
No
more
than
were
I
painted
I
would
wish
This
youth
should
say
twere
well
and
only
therefore
Desire
to
breed
by
me
Here

you
Hot
lavender

savory

The
marigold
that
goes
to

wi
th
sun
And
with
him
rises
weeping
these
are
flow
rs
Of
middle
summer
and
I
think
they
are
given
To
men
of
middle
age
Y
are
very
welcome
CAMILLO
I
should
leave
grazing
were
I
of
your
flock
And
only
live
by

PERDITA
Out
alas
You

be
so
lean
that

of
January
Would
blow
you
through

Now
my
fair

I
would
I
had
some

o

that

Become
your

of

and
yours
and

That

upon
your

Your
maidenheads
growing
O
Proserpina
From

flowers
now
that
frighted

st

From
Dis
s
waggon
daffodils
That
come
before
the
swallow
dares
and
take
The

of
March
with
beauty
violets
dim
But
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
Juno
s
eyes
Or
Cytherea
s

pale
primroses
That
die
unmarried
ere
they
can
behold
Bright
Phoebus

Most

and
The

To

To

FLORIZEL
What
like

PERDITA
No
like

to

Not

But
quick

in

Come

Methinks

In

Sure
this

Does

FLORIZEL
What
you

Still

When

To

When

Nothing

So

Crowns

That

You

As

To

POLIXENES
This

the
prettiest
low
born
lass
that
ever
Ran
on
the
green
sward
nothing
she
does
or
seems
But
smacks
of
something
greater
than
herself
Too
noble
for
this
place
CAMILLO
He
tells
her
something
That
makes
her

look
out
Good
sooth
she
is
The
queen
of

CLOWN

Which

SHEPHERD
They

Doricles

boasts
himself
To
have
a
worthy
feeding
but
I
have
it
Upon
his
own
report
and
I
believe
it
He
looks
like
sooth
He
says
he
loves
my
daughter
I
think
so
too
for
never
gaz
d
the
moon
Upon
the
water
as
he
ll
stand
and
read
As
twere
my
daughter

eyes
and
to
be
plain
I
think
there
is
not
half
a
kiss
to
choose
Who
loves
another
best
POLIXENES
She
dances
featly
SHEPHERD
So
she
does
any
thing
though
I
report
it
That

be
silent
If

Do
light
upon
her
she
shall
bring

that
Which
he
not
dreams
of
Enter

Wednesday

fourscore
of
April
forty
thousand
fathom
above

against

hard
hearts
of

It
was
thought

into

Up

I

already
But

O
hear

Before
this
ancient
sir
whom
it
should
seem
Hath
sometime
lov

I
take
thy
hand
this
hand
As
soft
as
dove

as
white

Or

POLIXENES
What
follows
this
How
prettily
the
young
swain
seems
to
wash
The
hand
was
fair
before
I
have
put
you
out
But
to
your
protestation
let
me
hear
What
you
profess
FLORIZEL
Do
and
be
witness
to
t
POLIXENES
And
this
my
neighbour
too
FLORIZEL
And
he
and
more
Than
he
and
men
the
earth
the
heavens
and
all
That
were
I
crown
d
the
most
imperial

Thereof
most
worthy
were
I
the
fairest
youth
That
ever
made

force
and
knowledge
More
than
was
ever

I
would
not
prize
them
Without
her
love
for

employ
them
all
Commend
them
and
condemn
them
to
her
service
Or
to
their
own
perdition
POLIXENES
Fairly
offer
d
CAMILLO
This
shows
a
sound
affection
SHEPHERD
But
my
daughter
Say
you
the
like
to
him
PERDITA
I
cannot
speak
So
well
nothing
so
well
no
nor
mean
better
By
th
pattern
of
mine
own
thoughts
I
cut
out
The
purity
of
his
SHEPHERD
Take
hands
a
bargain
And
friends
unknown
you
shall
bear
witness
to
t
I
give
my
daughter
to
him
and
will
make
Her
portion
equal
his
FLORIZEL
O
that
must
be
I
th
virtue
of
your
daughter
One
being
dead
I
shall
have
more
than
you
can
dream
of
yet
Enough
then
for
your
wonder
But
come
on
Contract
us
fore
these
witnesses
SHEPHERD
Come
your
hand
And
daughter
yours
POLIXENES
Soft
swain
awhile
beseech
you
Have
you
a
father
FLORIZEL
I
have
but
what
of
him
POLIXENES
Knows
he
of
this
FLORIZEL
He
neither
does
nor
shall
POLIXENES
Methinks
a
father
Is
at
the
nuptial
of
his
son
a
guest
That
best
becomes
the
table
Pray
you
once
more
Is
not
your
father
grown
incapable
Of
reasonable
affairs
Is
he
not
stupid
With
age
and
alt
ring
rheums
Can
he
speak
hear
Know
man
from
man
dispute
his
own
estate
Lies
he
not
bed
rid
and
again
does
nothing
But
what
he
did
being
childish
FLORIZEL
No
good
sir
He
has
his
health
and
ampler
strength
indeed
Than
most
have
of
his
age
POLIXENES
By
my
white
beard
You
offer
him
if
this
be
so
a
wrong
Something
unfilial
Reason
my
son
Should
choose
himself
a
wife
but
as
good
reason
The
father
all
whose
joy
is
nothing
else
But
fair
posterity
should
hold
some
counsel
In
such
a
business
FLORIZEL
I
yield
all
this
But
for
some
other
reasons
my
grave
sir
Which
tis
not
fit
you
know
I
not
acquaint
My
father
of
this
business
POLIXENES
Let
him
know
t
FLORIZEL
He
shall
not
POLIXENES
Prithee
let
him
FLORIZEL
No
he
must
not
SHEPHERD
Let
him
my
son
he
shall
not
need
to
grieve
At
knowing
of
thy
choice
FLORIZEL
Come
come
he
must
not
Mark
our
contract
POLIXENES
Discovering
himself
Mark
your
divorce
young
sir
Whom
son
I
dare
not
call
thou
art
too
base
To
be
acknowledg
d
thou
a
sceptre
s
heir
That
thus
affects
a
sheep
hook
Thou
old
traitor
I
am
sorry
that
by
hanging
thee
I
can
but
Shorten
thy
life
one
week
And
thou
fresh
piece
Of
excellent
witchcraft
who
of
force
must
know
The
royal
fool
thou
cop
st
with
SHEPHERD
O
my
heart
POLIXENES
I
ll
have
thy
beauty
scratch
d
with
briers
and
made
More
homely
than
thy
state
For
thee
fond
boy
If
I
may
ever
know
thou
dost
but
sigh
That
thou
no
more
shalt
see
this
knack
as
never
I
mean
thou
shalt
we
ll
bar
thee
from
succession
Not
hold
thee
of
our
blood
no
not
our
kin
Farre
than
Deucalion
off
Mark
thou
my
words
Follow
us
to
the
court
Thou
churl
for
this
time
Though
full
of
our
displeasure
yet
we
free
thee
From
the
dead
blow
of
it
And
you
enchantment
Worthy
enough
a
herdsman
yea
him
too
That
makes
himself
but
for
our
honour
therein
Unworthy
thee
if
ever
henceforth
thou
These
rural
latches
to
his
entrance
open
Or
hoop
his
body
more
with
thy
embraces
I
will
devise
a
death
as
cruel
for
thee
As
thou
art
tender
to
t
Exit
PERDITA
Even
here
undone
I
was
not
much
afeard
for
once
or
twice
I
was
about
to
speak
and
tell
him
plainly
The
self
same
sun
that
shines
upon
his
court
Hides
not
his
visage
from
our
cottage
but
Looks
on
alike
To
FLORIZEL
Will
t
please
you
sir
be
gone
I
told
you
what
would
come
of
this
Beseech
you
Of
your
own
state
take
care
This
dream
of
mine
Being
now
awake
I
ll
queen
it
no
inch
farther
But
milk
my
ewes
and
weep
CAMILLO
Why
how
now
father
Speak
ere
thou
diest
SHEPHERD
I
cannot
speak
nor
think
Nor
dare
to
know
that
which
I
know
To
FLORIZEL
O
sir
You
have
undone
a
man
of
fourscore
three
That
thought
to
fill
his
grave
in
quiet
yea
To
die
upon
the
bed
my
father
died
To
lie
close
by
his
honest
bones
but
now
Some
hangman
must
put
on
my
shroud
and
lay
me
Where
no
priest
shovels
in
dust
To
PERDITA
O
cursed
wretch
That
knew
st
this
was
the
Prince
and
wouldst
adventure
To
mingle
faith
with
him
Undone
undone
If
I
might
die
within
this
hour
I
have
liv
d
To
die
when
I
desire
Exit
FLORIZEL
Why
look
you
so
upon
me
I
am
but
sorry
not
afeard
delay
d
But
nothing
alt
red
What
I
was
I
am
More
straining
on
for
plucking
back
not
following
My
leash
unwillingly
CAMILLO
Gracious
my
lord
You
know
your
father
s
temper
At
this
time
He
will
allow
no
speech
which
I
do
guess
You
do
not
purpose
to
him
and
as
hardly
Will
he
endure
your
sight
as
yet
I
fear
Then
till
the
fury
of
his
Highness
settle
Come
not
before
him
FLORIZEL
I
not
purpose
it
I
think
Camillo
CAMILLO
Even
he
my
lord
PERDITA
How
often
have
I
told
you
twould
be
thus
How
often
said
my
dignity
would
last
But
till
twere
known
FLORIZEL
It
cannot
fail
but
by
The
violation
of
my
faith
and
then
Let
nature
crush
the
sides
o
th
earth
together
And
mar
the
seeds
within
Lift
up
thy
looks
From
my
succession
wipe
me

I
Am

my
affection
CAMILLO
Be

by

if

reason
Will
thereto
be
obedient
I
have
reason
If
not
my
senses

with
madness
Do
bid
it
welcome
CAMILLO
This
is
desperate
sir
FLORIZEL
So
call
it
but
it
does
fulfil
my
vow
I
needs
must
think
it
honesty

Not
