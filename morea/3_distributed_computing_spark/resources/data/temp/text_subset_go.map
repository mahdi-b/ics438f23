To

QUEEN
MARGARET
Peace
Master
Marquis
you
are
malapert
Your
fire
new
stamp
of
honour
is
scarce
current
O
that
your
young
nobility
could
judge
What
twere
to
lose
it
and
be
miserable
They
that
stand
high
have
many
blasts
to
shake
them
And
if
they
fall
they
dash
themselves
to
pieces
GLOUCESTER
Good
counsel

Marquis
DORSET
It
touches
you
my
lord
as
much
as
me
GLOUCESTER
Ay
and
much
more
but
I
was
born
so
high
Our
aery
buildeth
in
the
cedar
s
top
And
dallies
with
the
wind
and
scorns
the
sun
QUEEN
MARGARET
And
turns
the
sun
to
shade
alas
alas
Witness
my
son
now
in
the
shade
of
death
Whose
bright
out
shining
beams
thy
cloudy
wrath
Hath
in
eternal
darkness
folded
up
Your
aery
buildeth
in
our
aery
s
nest
O
God
that
seest
it
do
not
suffer
it
As
it
is
won
with
blood
lost
be
it
so
BUCKINGHAM
Peace
peace
for
shame
if
not
for
charity
QUEEN
MARGARET
Urge
neither
charity
nor
shame
to
me
Uncharitably
with
me
have
you
dealt
And
shamefully
my
hopes
by
you
are
butcher
d
My
charity
is
outrage
life
my
shame
And
in
that
shame
still
live
my
sorrow
s
rage
BUCKINGHAM
Have
done

done
QUEEN
MARGARET
O
princely
Buckingham
I
ll
kiss
thy
hand
In
sign
of
league
and
amity
with
thee
Now
fair
befall
thee
and
thy
noble
house
Thy
garments
are
not
spotted
with
our
blood
Nor
thou
within
the
compass
of
my
curse
BUCKINGHAM
Nor
no
one
here
for
curses
never
pass
The
lips
of
those
that
breathe
them
in
the
air
QUEEN
MARGARET
I
will
not
think
but
they
ascend
the
sky
And
there
awake
God
s
gentle
sleeping
peace
O
Buckingham
take
heed
of
yonder
dog
Look
when
he
fawns
he
bites
and
when
he
bites
His
venom
tooth
will
rankle
to
the
death
Have
not
to
do
with
him
beware
of
him
Sin
death
and
hell
have
set
their
marks
on
him
And
all
their
ministers
attend
on
him
GLOUCESTER
What
doth
she
say
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM
Nothing
that
I
respect
my
gracious
lord
QUEEN
MARGARET
What
dost
thou
scorn
me
for
my
gentle
counsel
And
soothe
the
devil
that
I
warn
thee
from
O
but
remember
this
another
day
When
he
shall
split
thy
very
heart
with
sorrow
And
say
poor
Margaret
was
a
prophetess
Live
each
of
you
the
subjects
to
his
hate
And
he
to
yours
and
all
of
you
to
God
s
Exit
BUCKINGHAM
My
hair
doth
stand
an
end
to
hear
her
curses
RIVERS
And
so
doth
mine
I
muse
why
she
s
at
liberty
GLOUCESTER
I
cannot
blame
her
by
God
s
holy
Mother
She
hath
had
too
much
wrong
and
I
repent
My
part
thereof
that
I
have
done
to
her
QUEEN
ELIZABETH
I
never
did
her
any
to
my
knowledge
GLOUCESTER
Yet
you
have
all
the
vantage
of
her
wrong
I
was
too
hot
to
do
somebody
good
That
is
too
cold
in
thinking
of
it
now
Marry
as
for
Clarence
he
is
well
repaid
He
is
frank
d
up
to
fatting
for
his
pains
God
pardon
them
that
are
the
cause
thereof
RIVERS
A
virtuous
and
a
Christian
like
conclusion
To
pray
for
them
that
have
done
scathe
to
us
GLOUCESTER
So
do
I

Aside

QUEEN

I

Lords

you
go
with

RIVERS
We
wait
upon
your
Grace
Exeunt
all
but
GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER
I
do
the
wrong
and
first
begin
to
brawl
The
secret
mischiefs
that
I
set
abroach
I
lay
unto
the
grievous
charge
of
others
Clarence
who
I
indeed
have
cast
in
darkness
I
do
beweep
to
many
simple
gulls
Namely
to
Derby
Hastings
Buckingham
And
tell
them
tis
the
Queen
and
her
allies
That
stir
the
King
against
the
Duke
my
brother
Now
they
believe
it
and
withal
whet
me
To
be
reveng
d
on
Rivers
Dorset
Grey
But
then
I
sigh
and
with
a
piece
of
Scripture
Tell
them
that
God
bids
us
do
good
for
evil
And
thus
I
clothe
my
naked
villainy
With
odd
old
ends
stol
n
forth
of
holy
writ
And
seem
a
saint
when
most
I
play
the
devil
Enter
two
MURDERERS
But
soft
here
come
my
executioners
How
now
my
hardy
stout
resolved
mates
Are
you
now
going
to
dispatch
this
thing
FIRST
MURDERER
We
are
my
lord
and
come
to
have
the
warrant
That
we
may
be
admitted
where
he
is
GLOUCESTER
Well
thought
upon
I
have
it
here
about
me
Gives
the
warrant
When
you
have
done
repair
to
Crosby
Place
But
sirs
be
sudden
in
the
execution
Withal
obdurate
do
not
hear
him
plead
For
Clarence
is
well
spoken
and
perhaps
May
move
your
hearts
to
pity
if
you
mark
him
FIRST
MURDERER
Tut
tut
my
lord
we
will
not
stand
to
prate
Talkers
are
no
good
doers
Be
assur

We
go
to
use
our
hands
and
not
our

GLOUCESTER
Your

drop
millstones
when

Go

SCENE

London
The
Tower
Enter
CLARENCE
and
KEEPER
KEEPER
Why
looks
your
Grace
so
heavily
to
day
CLARENCE
O
I
have
pass
d
a
miserable
night
So
full
of
fearful
dreams
of
ugly
sights
That
as
I
am
a
Christian
faithful
man
I
would
not
spend
another
such
a
night
Though
twere
to
buy
a
world
of
happy
days
So
full
of
dismal
terror
was
the
time
KEEPER
What
was
your
dream
my
lord
I
pray
you
tell
me
CLARENCE
Methoughts
that
I
had
broken
from
the
Tower
And
was
embark
d
to
cross
to
Burgundy
And
in
my
company
my
brother
Gloucester
Who
from
my
cabin
tempted
me
to
walk
Upon
the
hatches
Thence
we
look
d
toward
England
And
cited
up
a
thousand
heavy
times
During
the
wars
of
York
and
Lancaster
That
had
befall
n
us
As
we
pac
d
along
Upon
the
giddy
footing
of
the
hatches
Methought
that
Gloucester
stumbled
and
in
falling
Struck
me
that
thought
to
stay
him
overboard
Into
the
tumbling
billows
of
the
main
O
Lord
methought
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
What
dreadful
noise
of
waters
in
my
ears
What
sights
of
ugly
death
within
my
eyes
Methoughts
I
saw
a
thousand
fearful
wrecks
A
thousand
men
that
fishes
gnaw
d
upon
Wedges
of
gold
great
anchors
heaps
of
pearl
Inestimable
stones
unvalued
jewels
All
scatt
red
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
Some
lay
in
dead
men
s
skulls
and
in
the
holes
Where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
there
were
crept
As
twere
in
scorn
of
eyes
reflecting
gems
That
woo
d
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
deep
And
mock
d
the
dead
bones
that
lay
scatt
red
by
KEEPER
Had
you
such
leisure
in
the
time
of
death
To
gaze
upon
these
secrets
of
the
deep
CLARENCE
Methought
I
had
and
often
did
I
strive
To
yield
the
ghost
but
still
the
envious
flood
Stopp
d
in
my
soul
and
would
not
let
it
forth
To
find
the
empty
vast
and
wand
ring
air
But
smother
d
it
within
my
panting
bulk
Who
almost
burst
to
belch
it
in
the
sea
KEEPER
Awak
d
you
not
in
this
sore
agony
CLARENCE
No
no
my
dream
was
lengthen
d
after
life
O
then
began
the
tempest
to
my
soul
I
pass
d
methought
the
melancholy
flood
With
that
sour
ferryman
which
poets
write
of
Unto
the
kingdom
of
perpetual
night
The
first
that
there
did
greet
my
stranger
soul
Was
my
great
father
in
law
renowned
Warwick
Who
spake
aloud
What
scourge
for
perjury
Can
this
dark
monarchy
afford
false
Clarence
And
so
he
vanish
d
Then
came
wand
ring
by
A
shadow
like
an
angel
with
bright
hair
Dabbled
in
blood
and
he
shriek
d
out
aloud
Clarence
is
come
false
fleeting
perjur
d
Clarence
That
stabb
d
me
in
the
field
by
Tewksbury
Seize
on
him
Furies
take
him
unto
torment
With
that
methoughts
a
legion
of
foul
fiends
Environ
d
me
and
howled
in
mine
ears
Such
hideous
cries
that
with
the
very
noise
I
trembling
wak
d
and
for
a
season
after
Could
not
believe
but
that
I
was
in
hell
Such
terrible
impression
made
my
dream
KEEPER
No
marvel
lord
though
it
affrighted
you
I
am
afraid
methinks
to
hear
you
tell
it
CLARENCE
Ah
Keeper
Keeper
I
have
done
these
things
That
now
give
evidence
against
my
soul
For
Edward
s
sake
and
see
how
he
requites
me
O
God
If
my
deep
prayers
cannot
appease
Thee
But
Thou
wilt
be
aveng
d
on
my
misdeeds
Yet
execute
Thy
wrath
in
me
alone
O
spare
my
guiltless
wife
and
my
poor
children
KEEPER
I
prithee
sit
by
me
awhile
My
soul
is
heavy
and
I
fain
would
sleep
KEEPER
I
will
my
lord
God
give
your
Grace
good
rest
CLARENCE
sleeps
Enter
BRAKENBURY
the
Lieutenant
BRAKENBURY
Sorrow
breaks
seasons
and
reposing
hours
Makes
the
night
morning
and
the
noontide
night
Princes
have
but
their
titles
for
their
glories
An
outward
honour
for
an
inward
toil
And
for
unfelt
imaginations
They
often
feel
a
world
of
restless
cares
So
that
between
their
tides
and
low
name
There
s
nothing
differs
but
the
outward
fame
Enter
the
two
MURDERERS
FIRST
MURDERER
Ho
who
s
here
BRAKENBURY
What
wouldst
thou
fellow
and
how
cam
st
thou
hither
FIRST
MURDERER
I
would
speak
with
Clarence
and
I
came
hither
on
my
legs
BRAKENBURY
What
so
brief
SECOND
MURDERER
Tis
better
sir
than
to
be
tedious
Let
him
see
our
commission
and
talk
no
more
BRAKENBURY
reads
it
BRAKENBURY
I
am
in
this
commanded
to
deliver
The
noble
Duke
of
Clarence
to
your
hands
I
will
not
reason
what
is
meant
hereby
Because
I
will
be
guiltless
from
the
meaning
There
lies
the
Duke
asleep
and
there
the
keys
I
ll
to
the
King
and
signify
to
him
That
thus
I
have
resign
d
to
you
my
charge
FIRST
MURDERER
You
may
sir
tis
a
point
of
wisdom
Fare
you
well
Exeunt
BRAKENBURY
and
KEEPER
SECOND
MURDERER
What
shall
I
stab
him
as
he
sleeps
FIRST
MURDERER
No
he
ll
say
twas
done
cowardly
when
he
wakes
SECOND
MURDERER
Why
he
shall
never
wake
until
the
great
judgment
day
FIRST
MURDERER
Why
then
he
ll
say
we
stabb
d
him
sleeping
SECOND
MURDERER
The
urging
of
that
word
judgment
hath
bred
a
kind
of
remorse
in
me
FIRST
MURDERER
What
art
thou
afraid
SECOND
MURDERER
Not
to
kill
him
having
a
warrant
but
to
be
damn
d
for
killing
him
from
the
which
no
warrant
can
defend
me
FIRST
MURDERER
I
thought
thou
hadst
been
resolute
SECOND
MURDERER
So
I
am
to
let
him
live
FIRST
MURDERER
I
ll
back
to
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
and
tell
him
so
SECOND
MURDERER
Nay
I
prithee
stay
a
little
I
hope
this
passionate
humour
of
mine
will
change
it
was
wont
to
hold
me
but
while
one
tells
twenty
FIRST
MURDERER
How
dost
thou
feel
thyself
now
SECOND
MURDERER
Faith
some
certain
dregs
of
conscience
are
yet
within
me
FIRST
MURDERER
Remember
our
reward
when
the
deed
s
done
SECOND
MURDERER
Zounds
he
dies
I
had
forgot
the
reward
FIRST
MURDERER
Where
s
thy
conscience
now
SECOND
MURDERER
O
in
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
s
purse
FIRST
MURDERER
When
he
opens
his
purse
to
give
us
our
reward
thy
conscience
flies
out
SECOND
MURDERER
Tis
no
matter
let
it
go
there
s
few
or
none
will
entertain
it
FIRST
MURDERER
What
if
it
come
to
thee
again
SECOND
MURDERER
I
ll
not
meddle
with
it
it
makes
a
man
coward
a
man
cannot
steal
but
it
accuseth
him
a
man
cannot
swear
but
it
checks
him
a
man
cannot
lie
with
his
neighbour
s
wife
but
it
detects
him
Tis
a
blushing
shame
fac
d
spirit
that
mutinies
in
a
man
s
bosom
it
fills
a
man
full
of
obstacles
it
made
me
once
restore
a
purse
of
gold
that
by
chance
I
found
It
beggars
any
man
that
keeps
it
It
is
turn
d
out
of
towns
and
cities
for
a
dangerous
thing
and
every
man
that
means
to
live
well
endeavours
to
trust
to
himself
and
live
without
it
FIRST
MURDERER
Zounds
tis
even
now
at
my
elbow
persuading
me
not
to
kill
the
Duke
SECOND
MURDERER
Take
the
devil
in
thy
mind
and
believe
him
not
he
would
insinuate
with
thee
but
to
make
the
sigh
FIRST
MURDERER
I
am
strong
fram
d
he
cannot
prevail
with
me
SECOND
MURDERER
Spoke
like
a
tall
man
that
respects
thy
reputation
Come
shall
we
fall
to
work
FIRST
MURDERER
Take
him
on
the
costard
with
the
hilts
of
thy
sword
and
then
chop
him
in
the
malmsey
butt
in
the
next
room
SECOND
MURDERER
O
excellent
device
and
make
a
sop
of
him
FIRST
MURDERER
Soft
he
wakes
SECOND
MURDERER
Strike
FIRST
MURDERER
No
we
ll
reason
with
him
CLARENCE
Where
art
thou
Keeper
Give
me
a
cup
of
wine
SECOND
MURDERER
You
shall
have
wine
enough
my
lord
anon
CLARENCE
In
God
s
name
what
art
thou
FIRST
MURDERER
A
man
as
you
are
CLARENCE
But
not
as
I
am
royal
SECOND
MURDERER
Nor
you
as
we
are
loyal
CLARENCE
Thy
voice
is
thunder
but
thy
looks
are
humble
FIRST
MURDERER
My
voice
is
now
the
King
s
my
looks
mine
own
CLARENCE
How
darkly
and
how
deadly
dost
thou
speak
Your
eyes
do
menace
me
Why
look
you
pale
Who
sent
you
hither
Wherefore
do
you
come
SECOND
MURDERER
To
to
to
CLARENCE
To
murder
me
BOTH
MURDERERS
Ay
ay
CLARENCE
You
scarcely
have
the
hearts
to
tell
me
so
And
therefore
cannot
have
the
hearts
to
do
it
Wherein
my
friends
have
I
offended
you
FIRST
MURDERER
Offended
us
you
have
not
but
the
King
CLARENCE
I
shall
be
reconcil
d
to
him
again
SECOND
MURDERER
Never
my
lord
therefore
prepare
to
die
CLARENCE
Are
you
drawn
forth
among
a
world
of
men
To
slay
the
innocent
What
is
my
offence
Where
is
the
evidence
that
doth
accuse
me
What
lawful
quest
have
given
their
verdict
up
Unto
the
frowning
judge
or
who
pronounc
d
The
bitter
sentence
of
poor
Clarence
death
Before
I
be
convict
by
course
of
law
To
threaten
me
with
death
is
most
unlawful
I
charge
you
as
you
hope
to
have
redemption
By
Christ
s
dear
blood
shed
for
our
grievous
sins
That
you
depart
and
lay
no
hands
on
me
The
deed
you
undertake
is
damnable
FIRST
MURDERER
What
we
will
do
we
do
upon
command
SECOND
MURDERER
And
he
that
hath
commanded
is
our
King
CLARENCE
Erroneous
vassals
the
great
King
of
kings
Hath
in
the
tables
of
his
law
commanded
That
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
Will
you
then
Spurn
at
his
edict
and
fulfil
a
man
s
Take
heed
for
he
holds
vengeance
in
his
hand
To
hurl
upon
their
heads
that
break
his
law
SECOND
MURDERER
And
that
same
vengeance
doth
he
hurl
on
thee
For
false
forswearing
and
for
murder
too
Thou
didst
receive
the
sacrament
to
fight
In
quarrel
of
the
house
of
Lancaster
FIRST
MURDERER
And
like
a
traitor
to

How

When

such
dear
degree
CLARENCE
Alas

whose
sake
did
I
that
ill
deed
For
Edward
for
my
brother
for
his
sake
He
sends
you
not
to
murder
me
for
this
For
in
that
sin
he
is
as
deep
as
I
If
God
will
be
avenged
for
the
deed
O
know
you
yet
He
doth
it
publicly
Take
not
the
quarrel
from
His
pow
rful
arm
He
needs
no
indirect
or
lawless
course
To
cut
off
those
that
have
offended
Him
FIRST

Who

CLARENCE
It

with

That

Why

From

CLARENCE
Have

To

To

CLARENCE
Relent

FIRST
MURDERER
Relent
No

cowardly
and
womanish
CLARENCE
Not

is
beastly
savage
devilish
Which
of
you
if
you
were
a
prince
s
son
Being
pent
from

If

such
murderers
as

came
to
you
Would
not
entreat
for

My
friend
I
spy
some
pity
in
thy
looks
O
if
thine
eye
be
not
a
flatterer
Come

on
my

entreat
for

As

A
