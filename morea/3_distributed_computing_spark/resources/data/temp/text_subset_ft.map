A
tedious
brief
scene
of
young
Pyramus
And
his
love
Thisby
very
tragical
mirth
Merry
and
tragical
tedious
and
brief
That
is
hot
ice
and
wondrous
strange
snow
How
shall
we
find
the
concord
of
this
discord
PHILOSTRATE
A
play
there
is
my
lord
some
ten
words
long
Which
is
as
brief
as
I
have
known
a
play
But
by
ten
words
my
lord
it
is
too
long
Which
makes
it
tedious
for
in
all
the
play
There
is
not
one
word
apt
one
player
fitted
And
tragical
my
noble
lord
it
is
For
Pyramus
therein
doth
kill
himself
Which
when
I
saw
rehears
d
I
must
confess
Made
mine
eyes
water
but
more
merry
tears
The
passion
of
loud
laughter
never
shed
THESEUS
What
are
they
that
do
play
it
PHILOSTRATE
Hard
handed
men
that
work
in
Athens
here
Which
never
labour
d
in
their
minds
till
now
And
now
have
toil
d
their
unbreathed
memories
With
this
same
play
against
your
nuptial
THESEUS
And
we
will
hear
it
PHILOSTRATE
No
my
noble
lord
It
is
not
for
you
I
have
heard
it
over
And
it
is
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
Unless
you
can
find
sport
in
their
intents
Extremely
stretch
d
and
conn
d
with
cruel
pain
To
do
you
service
THESEUS
I
will
hear
that
play
For
never
anything
can
be
amiss
When
simpleness
and
duty
tender
it
Go
bring
them
in
and
take
your
places
ladies
Exit
PHILOSTRATE
HIPPOLYTA
I
love
not
to
see
wretchedness
o
er
charged
And
duty
in
his
service
perishing
THESEUS
Why
gentle
sweet
you
shall
see
no
such
thing
HIPPOLYTA
He
says
they
can
do
nothing
in
this
kind
THESEUS
The
kinder
we
to
give
them
thanks
for
nothing
Our
sport
shall
be
to
take
what
they
mistake
And
what
poor
duty
cannot
do
noble
respect
Takes
it
in
might
not
merit
Where
I
have
come
great
clerks
have
purposed
To
greet
me
with
premeditated
welcomes
Where
I
have
seen
them
shiver
and
look
pale
Make
periods
in
the
midst
of
sentences
Throttle
their
practis
d
accent
in
their
fears
And
in
conclusion
dumbly
have
broke
off
Not
paying
me
a
welcome
Trust
me
sweet
Out
of
this
silence
yet
I
pick
d
a
welcome
And
in
the
modesty
of
fearful
duty
I
read
as
much
as
from
the
rattling
tongue
Of
saucy
and
audacious
eloquence
Love
therefore
and
tongue
tied
simplicity
In
least
speak
most
to
my
capacity

the

Enter
QUINCE
as
the
PROLOGUE
PROLOGUE
If
we
offend
it
is
with
our
good
will
That
you
should
think
we
come
not
to
offend
But
with
good
will
To
show
our
simple
skill
That
is
the
true
beginning
of
our
end
Consider
then
we
come
but
in
despite
We
do
not
come
as
minding
to
content
you
Our
true
intent
is
All
for
your
delight
We
are
not
here
That
you
should
here
repent
you
The
actors
are
at
band
and
by
their
show
You
shall
know
all
that
you
are
like
to
know
THESEUS
This
fellow
doth
not
stand
upon
points
LYSANDER
He
hath
rid
his
prologue
like
a
rough
colt
he
knows
not
the
stop
A
good
moral
my
lord
it
is
not
enough
to
speak
but
to
speak
true
HIPPOLYTA
Indeed
he
hath
play
d
on
this
prologue
like
a
child
on
a
recorder
a
sound
but
not
in
government
THESEUS
His
speech
was
like
a
tangled
chain
nothing
im
paired
but
all
disordered
Who
is
next
Enter
with
a
trumpet
before
them
as
in
dumb
show

PROLOGUE
Gentles
perchance
you
wonder
at
this
show
But
wonder
on
till
truth
make
all
things
plain
This
man
is
Pyramus
if
you
would
know
This
beauteous
lady
Thisby
is
certain
This
man
with
lime
and
rough
cast
doth
present
Wall
that
vile
Wall
which
did
these
lovers
sunder
And
through
Walls
chink
poor
souls
they
are
content
To
whisper
At
the
which
let
no
man
wonder
This
man
with
lanthorn
dog
and
bush
of
thorn
Presenteth
Moonshine
for
if
you
will
know
By
moonshine
did
these
lovers
think
no
scorn
To
meet
at
Ninus
tomb
there
there
to
woo
This
grisly
beast
which
Lion
hight
by
name
The
trusty
Thisby
coming
first
by
night
Did
scare
away
or
rather
did
affright
And
as
she
fled
her
mantle
she
did
fall
Which
Lion
vile
with
bloody
mouth
did
stain
Anon
comes
Pyramus
sweet
youth
and
tall
And
finds
his
trusty
Thisby
s
mantle
slain
Whereat
with
blade
with
bloody
blameful
blade
He
bravely
broach
d
his
boiling
bloody
breast
And
Thisby
tarrying
in
mulberry
shade
His
dagger
drew
and
died
For
all
the
rest
Let
Lion
Moonshine
Wall
and
lovers
twain
At
large
discourse
while
here
they
do
remain
Exeunt

PYRAMUS
THISBY

and

THESEUS
I
wonder
if
the

be
to

DEMETRIUS
No
wonder
my
lord
one
lion
may
when
many
asses
do
WALL
In
this
same
interlude
it
doth
befall
That
I
one
Snout
by
name
present
a
wall
And
such
a
wall
as
I
would
have
you
think
That
had
in
it
a
crannied
hole
or
chink
Through
which
the
lovers
Pyramus
and
Thisby
Did
whisper
often
very
secretly
This
loam
this
rough
cast
and
this
stone
doth
show
That
I
am
that
same
wall
the
truth
is
so
And
this
the
cranny
is
right
and
sinister
Through
which
the
fearful
lovers
are
to
whisper
THESEUS
Would
you
desire
lime
and
hair
to
speak
better
DEMETRIUS
It
is
the
wittiest
partition
that
ever
I
heard
discourse
my
lord
Enter

THESEUS
Pyramus

PYRAMUS
O

Curs

deceiving

THESEUS
The

methinks
being

should
curse

PYRAMUS
No

not
Deceiving

Thisby

She
is
to
enter

and
I
am
to

You

O

For

My

Thy

And

And
I
like

Not

Now

DEMETRIUS
No
remedy
my
lord
when
walls
are
so
wilful
to
hear
without
warning
HIPPOLYTA
This
is
the
silliest
stuff
that
ever
I
heard
THESEUS
The
best
in
this
kind
are
but
shadows
and
the
worst
are
no
worse
if
imagination
amend
them
HIPPOLYTA
It
must
be
your
imagination
then
and
not
theirs
THESEUS
If
we
imagine
no
worse
of
them
than
they
of
themselves
they
may
pass
for
excellent
men
Here
come
two
noble
beasts
in
a
man
and
a
lion
Enter
LION
and
MOONSHINE
LION
You
ladies
you
whose
gentle
hearts
do
fear
The
smallest
monstrous
mouse
that
creeps
on
floor
May
now
perchance
both
quake
and
tremble
here
When
lion
rough
in
wildest
rage
doth
roar
Then
know
that
I
as
Snug
the
joiner
am
A
lion
fell
nor
else
no
lion
s
dam
For
if
I
should
as
lion
come
in
strife
Into
this
place
twere
pity
on
my
life
THESEUS
A
very
gentle
beast
and
of
a
good
conscience
DEMETRIUS
The
very
best
at
a
beast
my
lord
that
e
er
I
saw
LYSANDER
This
lion
is
a
very
fox
for
his
valour
THESEUS
True
and
a
goose
for
his
discretion
DEMETRIUS
Not
so
my
lord
for
his
valour
cannot
carry
his
discretion
and
the
fox
carries
the
goose
THESEUS
His
discretion
I
am
sure
cannot
carry
his
valour
for
the
goose
carries
not
the
fox
It
is
well
Leave
it
to
his
discretion
and
let
us
listen
to
the
Moon
MOONSHINE
This
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
DEMETRIUS
He
should
have
worn
the
horns
on
his
head
THESEUS
He
is
no
crescent
and
his
horns
are
invisible
within
the
circumference
MOONSHINE
This
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
Myself
the
Man
i
th
Moon
do
seem
to
be
THESEUS
This
is
the
greatest
error
of
all
the
rest
the
man
should
be
put
into
the
lantern
How
is
it
else
the
man
i
th
moon
DEMETRIUS
He
dares
not
come
there
for
the
candle
for
you
see
it
is
already
in
snuff
HIPPOLYTA
I
am
aweary
of
this
moon
Would
he
would
change
THESEUS
It
appears
by
his
small
light
of
discretion
that
he
is
in
the
wane
but
yet
in
courtesy
in
all
reason
we
must
stay
the
time
LYSANDER
Proceed
Moon
MOON
All
that
I
have
to

to
tell

the

this

my

Why

THESEUS
This
passion

the
death
of
a

would
go
near
to
make

look
sad
HIPPOLYTA
Beshrew

O

Less

THESEUS
With
the
help
of
a

he

HIPPOLYTA
How
chance
Moonshine
is
gone
before
Thisby
comes
back

finds
her

Re

She
will
find
him
by
starlight
Here
she
comes
and
her
passion
ends

HIPPOLYTA
Methinks
she
should
not
use
a
long
one
for
such
a

I
hope
she
will
be
brief
DEMETRIUS
A

Quite

Dead

Must

These

Are

Lovers

His

O

Come

With

Lay

the

Will
it
please
you
to
see

Epilogue

to
hear
a
Bergomask
dance
between
two

company
THESEUS
No
epilogue
I
pray
you
for
your
play
needs
no
excuse
Never
excuse
for
when
the
players
are
all
dead
there
need
none
to
be
blamed
Marry
if
he
that
writ
it
had
played
Pyramus
and
hang
d
himself
in
Thisby

garter
it
would
have
been
a
fine
tragedy
And
so
it
is
truly
and
very
notably
discharg

But
come
your
Bergomask
let
your
epilogue
alone
A
dance
The
iron
tongue
of
midnight
hath
told
twelve
Lovers
to
bed
tis
almost
fairy
time
I
fear
we
shall
out
sleep
the
coming
morn
As
much
as
we
this
night
have
overwatch
d
This
palpable
gross
play
hath
well
beguil
d
The
heavy
gait
of
night
Sweet
friends
to
bed
A
fortnight
hold
we
this
solemnity
In
nightly
revels
and
new
jollity
Exeunt
Enter
PUCK
with
a
broom
PUCK
Now
the
hungry
lion
roars
And
the
wolf
behowls
the
moon
Whilst
the
heavy
ploughman
snores
All
with
weary
task
fordone
Now
the
wasted
brands
do
glow
Whilst
the
screech
owl
screeching
loud
Puts
the
wretch
that
lies
in
woe
In
remembrance
of
a
shroud
Now
it
is
the
time
of
night
That
the
graves
all
gaping
wide
Every
one
lets
forth
his
sprite
In
the
church
way
paths
to
glide
And
we
fairies
that
do
run
By
the
triple
Hecate
s
team
From
the
presence
of
the
sun
Following
darkness
like
a
dream
Now
are
frolic
Not
a
mouse
Shall
disturb
this
hallowed
house
I
am
sent
with
broom
before
To
sweep
the
dust
behind
the
door
Enter
OBERON
and
TITANIA
with
all
their
train
OBERON
Through
the
house
give
glimmering
light
By
the
dead
and
drowsy
fire
Every
elf
and
fairy
sprite
Hop
as
light
as
bird
from
brier
And
this
ditty
after
me
Sing
and

First
rehearse
your
song
by

To
each

a

Hand

with

Will

OBERON
Now
until

Through

each

stray
To
the
best
bride
bed
will
we
Which
by
us
shall
blessed
be
And
the
issue
there
create
Ever
shall
be
fortunate
So
shall
all
the
couples
three
Ever
true
in
loving

And
the
blots
of
Nature

Shall
not

Never

Nor

Despised

Shall

With

Every
fairy

And
each
several

Through

And
the

If

Think

That

While
these

And
this
weak

idle
theme
No
more

a

Gentles
do
not
reprehend
If
you
pardon
we
will
mend
And
as

If

Now

We

Else

So

Give

SCENE
Messina
ACT
I
Scene
I
An
orchard
before
Leonato
s
house
Enter
Leonato
Governor
of
Messina
Hero
his
Daughter
and
Beatrice
his
Niece
with
a
Messenger
Leon
I
learn
in
this
letter
that
Don
Pedro
of
Arragon
comes
this
night
to
Messina
Mess
He
is
very
near
by
this
He
was
not
three
leagues
off
when
I
left
him
Leon
How
many
gentlemen
have
you
lost
in
this
action
Mess
But
few
of
any
sort
and
none
of
name
Leon
A
victory
is
twice
itself
when
the
achiever
brings
home
full
numbers
I
find
here
that
Don
Pedro
hath
bestowed
much
honour
on
a
young
Florentine
called
Claudio
Mess
Much
deserv
d
on
his
part
and
equally
rememb
red
by
Don
Pedro
He
hath
borne
himself
beyond
the
promise
of
his
age
doing
in
the
figure
of
a
lamb
the
feats
of
a
lion
He
hath
indeed
better
bett
red
expectation
than
you
must
expect
of
me
to
tell
you
how
Leon
He
hath
an
uncle
here
in
Messina
will
be
very
much
glad
of
it
Mess
I
have
already
delivered
him
letters
and
there
appears
much
joy
in
him
even
so
much
that
joy
could
not
show
itself
modest
enough
without
a
badge
of
bitterness
Leon
Did
he
break
out
into
tears
Mess
In
great
measure
Leon
A
kind
overflow
of
kindness
There
are
no
faces
truer
than
those
that
are
so
wash
d
How
much
better
is
it
to
weep
at
joy
than
to
joy
at
weeping
Beat
I
pray
you
is
Signior
Mountanto
return
d
from
the
wars
or
no
Mess
I
know
none
of
that
name
lady
There
was
none
such
in
the
army
of
any
sort
Leon
What
is
he
that
you
ask
for
niece
Hero
My
cousin
means
Signior
Benedick
of
Padua
Mess
O
he
s
return
d
and
as
pleasant
as
ever
he
was
Beat
He
set
up
his
bills
here
in
Messina
and
challeng
d
Cupid
at
the
flight
and
my
uncle
s
fool
reading
the
challenge
subscrib
d
for
Cupid
and
challeng
d
him
at
the
burbolt
I
pray
you
how
many
hath
he
kill
d
and
eaten
in
these
wars
But
how
many
hath
he
kill
d
For
indeed
I
promised
to
eat
all
of
his
killing
Leon
Faith
niece
you
tax
Signior
Benedick
too
much
but
he
ll
be
meet
with
you
I
doubt
it
not
Mess
He
hath
done
good
service
lady
in
these
wars
Beat
You
had
musty
victual
and
he
hath
holp
to
eat
it
He
is
a
very
valiant
trencherman
he
hath
an
excellent
stomach
Mess
And
a
good
soldier
too
lady
Beat
And
a
good
soldier
to
a
lady
but
what
is
he
to
a
lord
Mess
A
lord
to
a
lord
a
man
to
a
man
stuff
d
with
all
honourable
virtues
Beat
It
is
so
indeed
He
is
no
less
than
a
stuff
d
man
but
for
the
stuffing
well
we
are
all
mortal
Leon
You
must
not
sir
mistake
my
niece
There
is
a
kind
of
merry
war
betwixt
Signior
Benedick
and
her
They
never
meet
but
there
s
a
skirmish
of
wit
between
them
Beat
Alas
he
gets
nothing
by
that
In
our
last
conflict
four
of
his
five
wits
went
halting
off
and
now
is
the
whole
man
govern
d
with
one
so
that
if
he
have
wit
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
let
him
bear
it
for
a
difference
between
himself
and
his
horse
for
it
is
all
the
wealth
that
he
hath
left
to
be
known
a
reasonable
creature
Who
is
his
companion
now
He
hath
every
month
a
new
sworn
brother
Mess
Is
t
possible
Beat
Very
easily
possible
He
wears
his
faith
but
as
the
fashion
of
his
hat
it
ever
changes
with
the
next
block
Mess
I
see
lady
the
gentleman
is
not
in
your
books
Beat
No
An
he
were
I
would
burn
my
study
But
I
pray
you
who
is
his
companion
Is
there
no
young
squarer
now
that
will
make
a
voyage
with
him
to
the
devil
Mess
He
is
most
in
the
company
of
the
right
noble
Claudio
Beat
O
Lord
he
will
hang
upon
him
like
a
disease
He
is
sooner
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
God
help
the
noble
Claudio
If
he
have
caught
the
Benedick
it
will
cost
him
a
thousand
pound
ere
a
be
cured
Mess
I
will
hold
friends
with
you
lady
Beat
Do
good
friend
Leon
You
will
never
run
mad
niece
Beat
No
not
till
a
hot
January
