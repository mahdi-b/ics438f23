Marcus
mark
I
understand
her
signs
Had
she
a
tongue
to
speak
now
would
she
say
That
to
her
brother
which
I
said
to
thee
His
napkin
with
his
true
tears
all
bewet
Can
do
no
service
on
her
sorrowful
cheeks
O
what
a
sympathy
of
woe
is
this
As
far
from
help
as
Limbo
is
from
bliss
Enter
AARON
the
Moor
AARON
Titus
Andronicus
my
lord
the
Emperor
Sends
thee
this
word
that
if
thou
love
thy
sons
Let
Marcus
Lucius
or
thyself
old
Titus
Or
any
one
of
you
chop
off
your
hand
And
send
it
to
the
King
he
for
the
same
Will
send
thee
hither
both
thy
sons
alive
And
that
shall
be
the
ransom
for
their
fault
TITUS
O
gracious
Emperor
O
gentle
Aaron
Did
ever
raven
sing
so
like
a
lark
That
gives
sweet
tidings
of
the
sun
s
uprise
With
all
my
heart
I
ll
send
the
Emperor
my
hand
Good
Aaron
wilt
thou
help
to
chop
it
off
LUCIUS
Stay
father
for
that
noble
hand
of
thine
That
hath
thrown
down
so
many
enemies
Shall
not
be
sent
My
hand
will
serve
the
turn
My
youth
can
better
spare
my
blood
than
you
And
therefore
mine
shall
save
my
brothers
lives
MARCUS
Which
of
your
hands
hath
not
defended
Rome
And
rear
d
aloft
the
bloody
battle
axe
Writing
destruction
on
the
enemy
s
castle
O
none
of
both
but
are
of
high
desert
My
hand
hath
been
but
idle
let
it
serve
To
ransom
my
two
nephews
from
their
death
Then
have
I
kept
it
to
a
worthy
end
AARON
Nay
come
agree
whose
hand
shall
go
along
For
fear
they
die
before
their
pardon
come
MARCUS
My
hand
shall
go
LUCIUS
By
heaven
it
shall
not
go
TITUS
Sirs
strive
no
more
such
with
red
herbs
as
these
Are
meet
for
plucking
up
and
therefore
mine
LUCIUS
Sweet
father
if
I
shall
be
thought
thy
son
Let
me
redeem
my
brothers
both
from
death
MARCUS
And
for
our
father
s
sake
and
mother
s
care
Now
let
me
show
a
brother
s
love
to
thee
TITUS
Agree
between
you
I
will
spare
my
hand
LUCIUS
Then
I
ll
go
fetch
an
axe
MARCUS
But
I
will
use
the
axe
Exeunt
LUCIUS
and
MARCUS
TITUS
Come
hither
Aaron
I
ll
deceive
them
both
Lend
me
thy
hand
and
I
will
give
thee
mine
AARON
Aside
If
that
be
call
d
deceit
I
will
be
honest
And
never
whilst
I
live
deceive
men
so
But
I
ll
deceive
you
in
another
sort
And
that
you
ll
say
ere
half
an
hour
pass
He
cuts
off
TITUS

Re

LUCIUS
and
MARCUS
TITUS
Now
stay
your
strife
What
shall
be
is
dispatch
d
Good
Aaron
give
his
Majesty
my
hand
Tell
him
it
was
a
hand
that
warded
him
From
thousand
dangers
bid
him
bury
it
More
hath
it
merited
that
let
it
have
As
for
my
sons
say
I
account
of
them
As
jewels
purchas
d
at
an
easy
price
And
yet
dear
too
because
I
bought
mine
own
AARON
I
go
Andronicus
and
for
thy
hand
Look
by
and
by
to
have
thy
sons
with
thee
Aside
Their
heads
I
mean
O
how
this
villainy
Doth
fat
me
with
the
very
thoughts
of
it
Let
fools
do
good
and
fair
men
call
for
grace
Aaron
will
have
his
soul
black
like
his
face
Exit
TITUS
O
here
I
lift
this
one
hand
up
to
heaven
And
bow
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
If
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
To
that
I
call
To
LAVINIA
What
would
st
thou
kneel
with
me
Do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
Or
with
our
sighs
we
ll
breathe
the
welkin
dim
And
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
When
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
MARCUS
O
brother
speak
with
possibility
And
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
TITUS
Is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
Then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
MARCUS
But
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
TITUS
If
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
Then
into
limits
could
I
bind
my
woes
When
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
o
erflow
If
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
Threat
ning
the
welkin
with
his
big
swol
n
face
And
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
I
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
She
is
the
weeping
welkin
I
the
earth
Then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
Then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
Become
a
deluge
overflow
d
and
drown
d
For
why
my
bowels
cannot
hide
her
woes
But
like
a
drunkard
must
I
vomit
them
Then
give
me
leave
for
losers
will
have
leave
To
ease
their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues
Enter
a
MESSENGER
with
two
heads
and
a
hand
MESSENGER
Worthy
Andronicus
ill
art
thou
repaid
For
that
good
hand
thou
sent
st
the
Emperor
Here
are
the
heads
of
thy
two
noble
sons
And
here
s
thy
hand
in
scorn
to
thee
sent
back
Thy
grief
their
sports
thy
resolution
mock
d
That
woe
is
me
to
think
upon
thy
woes
More
than
remembrance
of
my
father
s
death
Exit
MARCUS
Now
let
hot
Aetna
cool
in
Sicily
And
be
my
heart
an
ever
burning
hell
These
miseries
are
more
than
may
be
borne
To
weep
with
them
that
weep
doth
ease
some
deal
But
sorrow
flouted
at
is
double
death
LUCIUS
Ah
that
this
sight
should
make
so
deep
a
wound
And
yet
detested
life
not
shrink
thereat
That
ever
death
should
let
life
bear
his
name
Where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
LAVINIA
kisses
TITUS
MARCUS
Alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
As
frozen
water
to
a
starved
snake
TITUS
When
will
this
fearful
slumber
have
an
end
MARCUS
Now
farewell
flatt
ry
die
Andronicus
Thou
dost
not
slumber
see
thy
two
sons
heads
Thy
warlike
hand
thy
mangled
daughter
here
Thy
other
banish
d
son
with
this
dear
sight
Struck
pale
and
bloodless
and
thy
brother
I
Even
like
a
stony
image
cold
and
numb
Ah
now
no
more
will
I
control
thy
griefs
Rent
off
thy
silver
hair
thy
other
hand
Gnawing
with
thy
teeth
and
be
this
dismal
sight
The
closing
up
of
our
most
wretched
eyes
Now
is
a
time
to
storm
why
art
thou
still
TITUS
Ha
ha
ha
MARCUS
Why
dost
thou
laugh
It
fits
not
with
this
hour
TITUS
Why
I
have
not
another
tear
to
shed
Besides
this
sorrow
is
an
enemy
And
would
usurp
upon
my
wat
ry
eyes
And
make
them
blind
with
tributary
tears
Then
which
way
shall
I
find
Revenge
s
cave
For
these
two
heads
do
seem
to
speak
to
me
And
threat
me
I
shall
never
come
to
bliss
Till
all
these
mischiefs
be
return
d
again
Even
in
their
throats
that
have
committed
them
Come
let
me
see
what
task
I
have
to
do
You
heavy
people
circle
me
about
That
I
may
turn
me
to
each
one
of
you
And
swear
unto
my
soul
to
right
your
wrongs
The
vow
is
made
Come
brother
take
a
head
And
in
this
hand
the
other
will
I
bear
And
Lavinia
thou

Bear

sweet
wench
between

As

Thou
art
an
exile
and
thou
must
not

Hie
to
the
Goths

raise
an
army
there
And
if

Let

YOUNG
LUCIUS
TITUS
So
so
now
sit
and
look
you
eat
no
more
Than
will
preserve
just
so
much
strength
in
us
As
will
revenge
these
bitter
woes
of
ours
Marcus
unknit
that
sorrow
wreathen
knot
Thy
niece
and
I
poor
creatures
want
our
hands
And
cannot
passionate
our
tenfold
grief
With
folded
arms
This
poor
right
hand
of
mine
Is
left
to
tyrannize
upon
my
breast
Who
when
my
heart
all
mad
with
misery
Beats
in
this
hollow
prison
of
my
flesh
Then
thus
I
thump
it
down
To
LAVINIA
Thou
map
of
woe
that
thus
dost
talk
in
signs
When
thy
poor
heart
beats
with
outrageous
beating
Thou
canst
not
strike
it
thus
to
make
it
still
Wound
it
with
sighing
girl
kill
it
with
groans
Or
get
some
little
knife
between
thy
teeth
And
just
against
thy
heart
make
thou
a
hole
That
all
the
tears
that
thy
poor
eyes
let
fall
May
run
into
that
sink
and
soaking
in
Drown
the
lamenting
fool
in
sea
salt
tears
MARCUS
Fie
brother
fie
Teach
her
not
thus
to
lay
Such
violent
hands
upon
her
tender
life
TITUS
How
now
Has
sorrow
made
thee
dote
already
Why
Marcus
no
man
should
be
mad
but
I
What
violent
hands
can
she
lay
on
her
life
Ah
wherefore
dost
thou
urge
the
name
of
hands
To
bid
Aeneas
tell
the
tale
twice
o
er
How
Troy
was
burnt
and
he
made
miserable
O
handle
not
the
theme
to
talk
of
hands
Lest
we
remember
still
that
we
have
none
Fie
fie
how
franticly
I
square
my
talk
As
if
we
should
forget
we
had
no
hands
If
Marcus
did
not
name
the
word
of
hands
Come
let
s
fall
to
and
gentle
girl
eat
this
Here
is
no
drink
Hark
Marcus
what
she
says
I
can
interpret
all
her
martyr
d
signs
She
says
she
drinks
no
other
drink
but
tears
Brew
d
with
her
sorrow
mesh
d
upon
her
cheeks
Speechless
complainer
I
will
learn
thy
thought
In
thy
dumb
action
will
I
be
as
perfect
As
begging
hermits
in
their
holy
prayers
Thou
shalt
not
sigh
nor
hold
thy
stumps
to
heaven
Nor
wink
nor
nod
nor
kneel
nor
make
a
sign
But
I
of
these
will
wrest
an
alphabet
And
by
still
practice
learn
to
know
thy
meaning
BOY
Good

How
if
that
fly
had
a
father
and
mother
How
would
he
hang
his
slender
gilded
wings
And
buzz
lamenting
doings
in

Poor

That
with
his
pretty
buzzing

YOUNG
LUCIUS
and
LAVINIA

the

with
his

under
his

Enter
TITUS
and
MARCUS
BOY
Help
grandsire
help
my
aunt
Lavinia
Follows
me
everywhere
I
know
not
why
Good
uncle
Marcus
see
how
swift
she
comes
Alas
sweet
aunt
I
know
not
what
you
mean
MARCUS
Stand
by
me
Lucius
do
not
fear
thine
aunt
TITUS
She
loves
thee
boy
too
well
to
do
thee
harm
BOY
Ay
when
my
father
was
in
Rome
she
did
MARCUS
What
means
my
niece
Lavinia
by
these
signs
TITUS
Fear
her
not
Lucius
somewhat
doth
she
mean
See
Lucius
see
how
much
she
makes
of
thee
Somewhither
would
she
have
thee
go
with
her
Ah
boy
Cornelia
never
with
more
care
Read
to
her
sons
than
she
hath
read
to
thee
Sweet
poetry
and
Tully
s
Orator
MARCUS
Canst
thou
not
guess
wherefore
she
plies
thee
thus
BOY
My
lord
I
know
not
I
nor
can
I
guess
Unless
some
fit
or
frenzy
do
possess
her
For
I
have
heard
my
grandsire
say
full
oft
Extremity
of
griefs
would
make
men
mad
And
I
have
read
that
Hecuba
of
Troy
Ran
mad
for
sorrow
That
made
me
to
fear
Although
my
lord
I
know
my
noble
aunt
Loves
me
as
dear
as
e
er
my
mother
did
And
would
not
but
in
fury
fright
my
youth
Which
made
me
down
to
throw
my
books
and
fly
Causeless
perhaps
But
pardon
me
sweet
aunt
And
madam
if
my
uncle
Marcus
go
I
will
most
willingly
attend
your
ladyship
MARCUS
Lucius
I

LAVINIA

Lucius

How
now

means
this
Some
book
there
is
that
she
desires

see
Which
is

these
Open

of

And
so
beguile
thy
sorrow
till
the
heavens
Reveal
the
damn

contriver
of
this
deed
Why
lifts
she
up
her
arms
in
sequence
thus
MARCUS
I
think
she
means
that
there
were
more
than
one
Confederate
in
the
fact
ay
more
there
was
Or
else
to

she
heaves

Now
