Fearing
to
strengthen
that
impatience
Which
seem
d
too
much
enkindled
and
withal
Hoping
it
was
but
an
effect
of
humor
Which
sometime
hath
his
hour
with
every
man
It
will
not
let
you
eat
nor
talk
nor
sleep
And
could
it
work
so
much
upon
your
shape
As
it
hath
much
prevail
d
on
your
condition
I
should
not
know
you
Brutus
Dear
my
lord
Make
me
acquainted
with
your
cause
of
grief
BRUTUS
I
am
not
well
in
health
and
that
is
all
PORTIA
Brutus
is
wise
and
were
he
not
in
health
He
would
embrace
the
means
to
come
by
it
BRUTUS
Why
so
I
do
Good
Portia
go
to
bed
PORTIA
Is
Brutus
sick
and
is
it
physical
To
walk
unbraced
and
suck
up
the
humors
Of
the
dank
morning
What
is
Brutus
sick
And
will
he
steal
out
of
his
wholesome
bed
To
dare
the
vile
contagion
of
the
night
And
tempt
the
rheumy
and
unpurged
air
To
add
unto
his
sickness
No
my
Brutus
You
have
some
sick
offense
within
your
mind
Which
by
the
right
and
virtue
of
my
place
I
ought
to
know
of
and
upon
my
knees
I
charm
you
by
my
once
commended
beauty
By
all
your
vows
of
love
and
that
great
vow
Which
did
incorporate
and
make
us
one
That
you
unfold
to
me
yourself
your
half
Why
you
are
heavy
and
what
men
tonight
Have
had
resort
to
you
for
here
have
been
Some
six
or
seven
who
did
hide
their
faces
Even
from
darkness
BRUTUS
Kneel
not
gentle
Portia
PORTIA
I
should
not
need
if
you
were
gentle
Brutus
Within
the
bond
of
marriage
tell
me
Brutus
Is
it
excepted
I
should
know
no
secrets
That
appertain
to
you
Am
I
yourself
But
as
it
were
in
sort
or
limitation
To
keep
with
you
at
meals
comfort
your
bed
And
talk
to
you
sometimes
Dwell
I
but
in
the
suburbs
Of
your
good
pleasure
If
it
be
no
more
Portia
is
Brutus
harlot
not
his
wife
BRUTUS
You
are
my
true
and
honorable
wife
As
dear
to
me
as
are
the
ruddy
drops
That
visit
my
sad
heart
PORTIA
If
this
were
true
then
should
I
know
this
secret
I
grant
I
am
a
woman
but
withal
A
woman
that
Lord
Brutus
took
to
wife
I
grant
I
am
a
woman
but
withal
A
woman
well
reputed
Cato
s
daughter
Think
you
I
am
no
stronger
than
my
sex
Being
so
father
d
and
so
husbanded
Tell
me
your
counsels
I
will
not
disclose
em
I
have
made
strong
proof
of
my
constancy
Giving
myself
a
voluntary
wound
Here
in
the
thigh
Can
I
bear
that
with
patience
And
not
my
husband
s
secrets
BRUTUS
O
ye
gods
Render
me
worthy
of
this
noble
wife
Knocking
within
Hark
hark
one
knocks
Portia
go
in
awhile
And
by
and
by
thy
bosom
shall
partake
The
secrets
of
my
heart
All
my
engagements
I
will
construe
to
thee
All
the
charactery
of
my
sad
brows
Leave
me
with
haste
Exit
Portia
Lucius
who
s
that
knocks
Re
enter
Lucius
with
Ligarius
LUCIUS
Here
is
a
sick
man
that
would
speak
with
you
BRUTUS
Caius
Ligarius
that
Metellus
spake
of
Boy

aside
Caius
Ligarius
how
LIGARIUS
Vouchsafe
good
morrow
from
a
feeble
tongue
BRUTUS
O
what
a
time
have
you
chose
out
brave
Caius
To
wear
a
kerchief
Would
you
were
not
sick
LIGARIUS
I
am
not
sick
if
Brutus
have
in
hand
Any
exploit
worthy
the
name
of
honor
BRUTUS
Such
an
exploit
have
I
in
hand
Ligarius
Had
you
a
healthful
ear
to
hear
of
it
LIGARIUS
By
all
the
gods
that
Romans
bow
before
I
here
discard
my
sickness
Soul
of
Rome
Brave
son
derived
from
honorable
loins
Thou
like
an
exorcist
hast
conjured
up
My
mortified
spirit
Now
bid
me
run
And
I
will
strive
with
things
impossible
Yea
get
the
better
of
them
What
s
to
do
BRUTUS
A
piece
of
work
that
will
make
sick
men
whole
LIGARIUS
But
are
not
some
whole
that
we
must
make
sick
BRUTUS
That
must
we
also
What
it
is
my
Caius
I
shall
unfold
to
thee
as
we
are
going
To
whom
it
must
be
done
LIGARIUS
Set
on
your
foot
And
with
a
heart
new
fired
I
follow
you
To
do
I
know
not
what
but
it
sufficeth
That
Brutus
leads
me
on
BRUTUS
Follow
me
then
Exeunt

II
Caesar
s
house
Thunder
and
lightning
Enter
Caesar
in
his
nightgown
CAESAR
Nor
heaven
nor
earth
have
been
at
peace
tonight
Thrice
hath
Calpurnia
in
her
sleep
cried
out
Help
ho
They
murther
Caesar
Who
s
within
Enter
a
Servant
SERVANT
My
lord
CAESAR
Go
bid
the
priests
do
present
sacrifice
And
bring
me
their
opinions
of
success
SERVANT
I
will
my
lord
Exit
Enter
Calpurnia
CALPURNIA
What
mean
you
Caesar
Think
you
to
walk
forth
You
shall
not
stir
out
of
your
house
today
CAESAR
Caesar
shall
forth
the
things
that
threaten
d
me
Ne
er
look
d
but
on
my
back
when
they
shall
see
The
face
of
Caesar
they
are
vanished
CALPURNIA
Caesar
I
I
stood
on
ceremonies
Yet
now
they
fright
me
There
is
one
within
Besides
the
things
that
we
have
heard
and
seen
Recounts
most
horrid
sights
seen
by
the
watch
A
lioness
hath
whelped
in
the
streets
And
graves
have
yawn
d
and
yielded
up
their
dead
Fierce
fiery
warriors
fight
upon
the
clouds
In
ranks
and
squadrons
and
right
form
of
war
Which
drizzled
blood
upon
the
Capitol
The
noise
of
battle
hurtled
in
the
air
Horses
did
neigh
and
dying
men
did
groan
And
ghosts
did
shriek
and
squeal
about
the
streets
O
Caesar
These
things
are
beyond
all
use
And
I
do
fear
them
CAESAR
What
can
be
avoided
Whose
end
is
purposed
by
the
mighty
gods
Yet
Caesar
shall
go
forth
for
these
predictions
Are
to
the
world
in
general
as
to
Caesar
CALPURNIA
When
beggars
die
there
are
no
comets
seen
The
heavens
themselves
blaze
forth
the
death
of
princes
CAESAR
Cowards
die
many
times
before
their
deaths
The
valiant
never
taste
of
death
but
once
Of
all
the
wonders
that
I
yet
have
heard
It
seems
to
me
most
strange
that
men
should
fear
Seeing
that
death
a
necessary
end
Will
come
when
it
will
come
Re
enter
Servant
What
say
the
augurers
SERVANT
They
would
not
have
you
to
stir
forth
today
Plucking
the
entrails
of
an
offering
forth
They
could
not
find
a
heart
within
the
beast
CAESAR
The
gods
do
this
in
shame
of
cowardice
Caesar
should
be
a
beast
without
a
heart
If
he
should
stay
at
home
today
for
fear
No
Caesar
shall
not
Danger
knows
full
well
That
Caesar
is
more
dangerous
than
he
We
are
two
lions
litter
d
in
one
day
And
I
the
elder
and
more
terrible
And
Caesar
shall
go
forth
CALPURNIA
Alas
my
lord
Your
wisdom
is
consumed
in
confidence
Do
not
go
forth
today
Call
it
my
fear
That
keeps
you
in
the
house
and
not
your
own
We
ll
send
Mark
Antony
to
the
Senate
House
And
he
shall
say
you
are
not
well
today
Let
me
upon
my
knee
prevail
in
this
CAESAR
Mark
Antony
shall
say
I
am
not
well
And
for
thy
humor
I
will
stay
at
home
Enter
Decius
Here
s
Decius
Brutus
he
shall
tell
them
so
DECIUS
Caesar
all
hail
Good
morrow
worthy
Caesar
I
come
to
fetch
you
to
the
Senate
House
CAESAR
And
you
are
come
in
very
happy
time
To
bear
my
greeting
to
the
senators
And
tell
them
that
I
will
not
come
today
Cannot
is
false
and
that
I
dare
not
falser
I
will
not
come
today
Tell
them
so
Decius
CALPURNIA
Say
he
is
sick
CAESAR
Shall
Caesar
send
a
lie
Have
I
in
conquest
stretch
d
mine
arm
so
far
To
be
afeard
to
tell
greybeards
the
truth
Decius
go
tell
them
Caesar
will
not
come
DECIUS
Most
mighty
Caesar
let
me
know
some
cause
Lest
I
be
laugh
d
at
when
I
tell
them
so
CAESAR
The
cause
is
in
my
will
I
will
not
come
That
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
Senate
But
for
your
private
satisfaction
Because
I
love
you
I
will
let
you
know
Calpurnia
here
my
wife
stays
me
at
home
She
dreamt
tonight
she
saw
my
statue
Which
like
a
fountain
with
an
hundred
spouts
Did
run
pure
blood
and
many
lusty
Romans
Came
smiling
and
did
bathe
their
hands
in
it
And
these
does
she
apply
for
warnings
and
portents
And
evils
imminent
and
on
her
knee
Hath
begg
d
that
I
will
stay
at
home
today
DECIUS
This
dream
is
all
amiss
interpreted
It
was
a
vision
fair
and
fortunate
Your
statue
spouting
blood
in
many
pipes
In
which
so
many
smiling
Romans
bathed
Signifies
that
from
you
great
Rome
shall
suck
Reviving
blood
and
that
great
men
shall
press
For
tinctures
stains
relics
and
cognizance
This
by
Calpurnia
s
dream
is
signified
CAESAR
And
this
way
have
you
well
expounded
it
DECIUS
I
have
when
you
have
heard
what
I
can
say
And
know
it
now
the
Senate
have
concluded
To
give
this
day
a
crown
to
mighty
Caesar
If
you
shall
send
them
word
you
will
not
come
Their
minds
may
change
Besides
it
were
a
mock
Apt
to
be
render
d
for
someone
to
say
Break
up
the
Senate
till
another
time
When
Caesar
s
wife
shall
meet
with
better
dreams
If
Caesar
hide
himself
shall
they
not
whisper
Lo
Caesar
is
afraid
Pardon
me
Caesar
for
my
dear
dear
love
To
your
proceeding
bids
me
tell
you
this
And
reason
to
my
love
is
liable
CAESAR
How
foolish
do
your
fears
seem
now
Calpurnia
I
am
ashamed
I
did
yield
to
them
Give
me
my
robe
for
I
will
go
Enter
Publius
Brutus
Ligarius
Metellus
Casca
Trebonius
and
Cinna
And
look

to

so
early
too
Good
morrow
Casca
Caius
Ligarius
Caesar

much
your
enemy
As

ague
which
hath

you

courtesy
Enter

long
o
nights
Is

Good
morrow
Antony
ANTONY
So
to
most
noble
Caesar
CAESAR
Bid
them
prepare
within
I
am
to
blame
to
be
thus
waited
for
Now
Cinna

Metellus
what
Trebonius
I
have
an
hour

in

for
you
Remember
that
you

me
today
Be
near
me
that
I
may
remember
you
TREBONIUS
Caesar
I
will
Aside
And
so
near
will
I
be
That
your
best
friends
shall
wish
I
had
been
further
CAESAR
Good
friends
go
in
and
taste
some
wine
with
me
And
we
like
friends
will
straightway
go
together
BRUTUS
Aside
That
every
like
is
not
the
same
O
Caesar
The
heart
of
Brutus
yearns
to
think
upon

Metellus
Cimber
Decius
Brutus
loves
thee
not
thou
hast
wronged
Caius
Ligarius
There
is
but
one
mind
in
all
these
men
and
it
is
bent
against
Caesar
If
thou
beest
not
immortal
look
about
you
Security
gives
way
to
conspiracy
The
mighty
gods
defend
thee
Thy
lover
Artemidorus
Here
will
I
stand
till
Caesar
pass
along
And
as
a
suitor
will
I
give
him
this
My
heart
laments
that
virtue
cannot
live
Out
of
the
teeth
of
emulation
If
thou
read
this
O
Caesar
thou
mayest
live
If
not
the
Fates
with
traitors
do
contrive

Ere

Set
a
huge
mountain

How
hard
it
is
for

Art

LUCIUS
Madam
what
should
I
do
Run
to
the
Capitol

PORTIA
Yes

Hark

noise

LUCIUS
I

madam
PORTIA
Prithee

Why

None

The
throng
that

Caesar
at
the

Of

of
praetors
common
suitors
Will
crowd
a
feeble
man
almost
to

there
Speak

Caesar

Ay

The

The

Sure
the

Brutus

a

That

O
I

Run

Senate
House
the
rest

POPILIUS
I
wish
your
enterprise
today
may
thrive
CASSIUS
What
enterprise
Popilius
POPILIUS
Fare
you
well
Advances
to
Caesar
BRUTUS
What
said
Popilius
Lena
CASSIUS
He
wish
d
today
our
enterprise
might
thrive
I
fear
our
purpose
is
discovered
BRUTUS
Look
how
he
makes
to
Caesar
Mark
him
CASSIUS
Casca
Be
sudden
for
we
fear
prevention
Brutus
what
shall
be
done
If
this
be
known
Cassius
or
Caesar
never
shall
turn
back
For
I
will
slay
myself
BRUTUS
Cassius
be
constant
Popilius
Lena
speaks
not
of
our
purposes
For
look
he
smiles
and
Caesar
doth
not
change
CASSIUS
Trebonius
knows
his
time
for
look
you
Brutus
He
draws
Mark
Antony
out
of
the
way
Exeunt
Antony
and
Trebonius
DECIUS
Where
is
Metellus
Cimber
Let
him
And
presently
prefer
his
suit
to
Caesar
BRUTUS
He
is
address
d
press
near
and
second
him
CINNA
Casca
you
are
the
first
that
rears
your
hand
CAESAR
Are
we
all
ready
What
is
now
amiss
That
Caesar
and
his
Senate
must
redress
METELLUS
Most
high
most
mighty
and
most
puissant
Caesar
Metellus
Cimber
throws
before
thy
seat
An
humble
heart
Kneels
CAESAR
I
must
prevent
thee
Cimber
These
couchings
and
these
lowly
courtesies
Might
fire
the
blood
of
ordinary
men
And
turn
preordinance
and
first
decree
Into
the
law
of
children
Be
not
fond
To
think
that
Caesar
bears
such
rebel
blood
That
will
be
thaw
d
from
the
true
quality
With
that
which
melteth
fools
I
mean
sweet
words
Low
crooked
court
sies
and
base
spaniel
fawning
Thy
brother
by
decree
is
banished
If
thou
dost
bend
and
pray
and
fawn
for
him
I
spurn
thee
like
a
cur
out
of
my
way
Know
Caesar
doth
not
wrong
nor
without
cause
Will
he
be
satisfied
METELLUS
Is
there
no
voice
more
worthy
than
my
own
To
sound
more
sweetly
in
great
Caesar
s
ear
For
the
repealing
of
my
banish
d
brother
BRUTUS
I
kiss
thy
hand
but
not
in
flattery
Caesar
Desiring
thee
that
Publius
Cimber
may
Have
an
immediate
freedom
of
repeal
CAESAR
What
Brutus
CASSIUS
Pardon
Caesar
Caesar
pardon
As
low
as
to
thy
foot
doth
Cassius
fall
To
beg
enfranchisement
for
Publius
Cimber
CAESAR
I
could
be
well
moved
if
I
were
as
you
If
I
could
pray
to
move
prayers
would
move
me
But
I
am
constant
as
the
northern
star
Of
whose
true
fix
d
and
resting
quality
There
is
no
fellow
in
the
firmament
The
skies
are
painted
with
unnumber
d
sparks
They
are
all
fire
and
every
one
doth
shine
But
there
s
but
one
in
all
doth
hold
his
place
So
in
the
world
tis
furnish
d
well
with
men
And
men
are
flesh
and
blood
and
apprehensive
Yet
in
the
number
I
do
know
but
one
That
unassailable
holds
on
his
rank
Unshaked
of
motion
and
that
I
am
he
Let
me
a
little
show
it
even
in
this
That
I
was
constant
Cimber
should
be
banish
d
And
constant
do
remain
to
keep
him
so
CINNA
O
Caesar
CAESAR
Hence
Wilt
thou
lift
up
Olympus
DECIUS
Great
Caesar
CAESAR
Doth
not
Brutus
bootless
kneel
CASCA
Speak
hands
for
me
Casca
first
then
the
other
Conspirators
and
Marcus
Brutus
stab
Caesar
CAESAR
Et
tu
Brute
Then
fall
Caesar
Dies
CINNA
Liberty
Freedom
Tyranny
is
dead
Run
hence
proclaim
cry
it
about
the
streets
CASSIUS
Some
to
the
common
pulpits
and
cry
out
Liberty
freedom
and
enfranchisement
BRUTUS
People
and
senators
be
not
affrighted
Fly
not
stand
still
ambition
s
debt
is
paid
CASCA
Go
to
the
pulpit
Brutus
DECIUS
And
Cassius
too
BRUTUS
Where
s
Publius
CINNA
Here
quite
confounded
with
this
mutiny
METELLUS
Stand
fast
together
lest
some
friend
of
Caesar
s
Should
chance
BRUTUS
Talk
not
of
standing
Publius
good
cheer
There
is
no
harm
intended
to
your
person
Nor
to
no
Roman
else
So
tell
them
Publius
CASSIUS
And
leave
us
Publius
lest
that
the
people
Rushing
on
us
should
do
your
age
some
mischief
BRUTUS
Do
so
and
let
no
man
abide
this
deed
But
we
the
doers
Re
enter
Trebonius
CASSIUS
Where
is
Antony
TREBONIUS
Fled
to
his
house
amazed
Men
wives
and
children
stare
cry
out
and
run
As
it
were
doomsday
BRUTUS
Fates
we
will
know
your
pleasures
That
we
shall
die
we
know
tis
but
the
time
And
drawing
days
out
that
men
stand
upon
CASSIUS
Why
he
that
cuts
off
twenty
years
of
life
Cuts
off
so
many
years
of
fearing
death
BRUTUS
Grant
that
and
then
is
death
a
benefit
So
are
we
Caesar
s
friends
that
have
abridged
His
time
of
fearing
death
Stoop
Romans
stoop
And
let
us
bathe
our
hands
in
Caesar
s
blood
Up
to
the
elbows
and
besmear
our
swords
Then
walk
we
forth
even
to
the
marketplace
And
waving
our
red
weapons
o
er
our
heads
Let
s
all
cry
Peace
freedom
and
liberty
CASSIUS
Stoop
then
and
wash
How
many
ages
hence
Shall
this
our
lofty
scene
be
acted
over
In
states
unborn
and
accents
yet
unknown
BRUTUS
How
many
times
shall
Caesar
bleed
in
sport
That
now
on
Pompey
s
basis
lies
along
No
worthier
than
the
dust
CASSIUS
So
oft
as
that
shall
be
So
often
shall
the
knot
of
us
be
call
d
The
men
that
gave
their
country
liberty
DECIUS
What
shall
we
forth
CASSIUS
Ay
every
man
away
Brutus
shall
lead
and
we
will
grace
his
heels
With
the
most
boldest
and
best
hearts
of
Rome
Enter
a
Servant
BRUTUS
Soft
who
comes
here
A
friend
of
Antony
s
SERVANT
Thus
Brutus
did
my
master
bid
me
kneel
Thus
did
Mark
Antony
bid
me
fall
down
And
being
prostrate
thus
he
bade
me
say
Brutus
is
noble
wise
valiant
and
honest
Caesar
was
mighty
bold
royal
and
loving
Say
I
love
Brutus
and
I
honor
him
Say
I
fear
d
Caesar
honor
d
him
and
loved
him
If
Brutus
will
vouchsafe
that
Antony
May
safely
come
to
him
and
be
resolved
How
Caesar
hath
deserved
to
lie
in
death
Mark
Antony
shall
not
love
Caesar
dead
So
well
as
Brutus
living
but
will
follow
The
fortunes
and
affairs
of
noble
Brutus
Thorough
the
hazards
of
this
untrod
state
With
all
true
faith
So
says
my
master
Antony
BRUTUS
Thy
master
is
a
wise
and
valiant
Roman
I
never
thought
him
worse
Tell
him
so
please
him
come
unto
this
place
He
shall
be
satisfied
and
by
my
honor
Depart
untouch
d
SERVANT
I
ll
fetch
him
presently
Exit
BRUTUS
I
know
that
we
shall
have
him
well
to
friend
CASSIUS
I
wish
we
may
but
yet
have
I
a
mind
That
fears
him
much
and
my
misgiving
still
Falls
shrewdly
to
the
purpose
Re
enter
Antony
BRUTUS
But
here
comes
Antony
Welcome
Mark
Antony
ANTONY
O
mighty
Caesar
Dost
thou
lie
so
low
Are
all
thy
conquests
glories
triumphs
spoils
Shrunk
to
this
little
measure
Fare
thee
well
I
know
not
gentlemen
what
you
intend
Who
else
must
be
let
blood
who
else
is
rank
If
I
myself
there
is
no
hour
so
fit
As
Caesar
s
death
s
hour
nor
no
instrument
