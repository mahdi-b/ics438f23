I

charity
but
say
I
warned

Take
heed
for

sake
take
heed
lest
at
once
The
burden
of
my
sorrows
fall
upon

WOLSEY
Madam
this
is
a
mere
distraction
You
turn
the
good
we
offer
into
envy
QUEEN
KATHARINE
Ye
turn
me
into
nothing
Woe
upon
ye
And
all
such
false
professors
Would
you
have
me
If
you
have
any
justice
any
pity
If
ye
be
any
thing
but
churchmen
s
habits
Put
my
sick
cause
into
his
hands
that
hates
me
Alas
has
banish
d
me
his
bed
already
His
love
too
long
ago
I
am
old
my
lords
And
all
the
fellowship
I
hold
now
with
him
Is
only
my
obedience
What
can
happen
To
me
above
this
wretchedness
All
your
studies
Make
me
a
curse
like
this
CAMPEIUS
Your
fears
are
worse
QUEEN
KATHARINE
Have
I
liv
d
thus
long
let
me
speak
myself
Since
virtue
finds
no
friends
a
wife
a
true
one
A
woman
I
dare
say
without
vain
glory
Never
yet
branded
with
suspicion
Have
I
with
all
my
full
affections
Still
met
the
King
lov
d
him
next
heav

d
him
Been
out
of
fondness
superstitious
to
him
Almost
forgot
my
prayers
to
content
him
And
am
I
thus
rewarded
Tis
not
well
lords
Bring
me
a
constant
woman
to
her
husband
One
that
ne
er
dream
d
a
joy
beyond
his
pleasure
And
to
that
woman
when
she
has
done
most
Yet
will
I
add
an
honour
a
great
patience
WOLSEY
Madam
you
wander
from
the
good
we
aim
at
QUEEN
KATHARINE
My
lord
I
dare
not
make
myself
so
guilty
To
give
up
willingly
that
noble

Your

wed
me
to
nothing
but
death
Shall
e

WOLSEY
Pray
hear
me
QUEEN
KATHARINE
Would
I
had
never
trod
this
English
earth
Or
felt
the
flatteries
that

Ye

angels
faces
but
heaven
knows
your

What
will
become
of
me
now
wretched
lady
I
am
the
most
unhappy
woman
living
To
her
WOMEN
Alas
poor
wenches
where

now
your

Shipwreck
d
upon
a
kingdom
where

No

for
me
Almost
no

me
Like
the
My
That

WOLSEY
If
your
Grace
Could

be
brought
to

our

You

feel
more

Why
should
we
good

Upon
what
cause

you
Alas
our
places
The
way
of
our
profession
is
against
it
We
are
to

such

not

For
goodness

consider
what
you
do
How
you
may
hurt
yourself
ay
utterly
Grow
from
the
King
s
acquaintance
by
this
carriage
The
hearts
of
princes
kiss
obedience
So
much
they
love
it
but
to
stubborn
spirits
They
swell
and
grow
as
terrible
as
storms
I
know
you
have
a
gentle
noble

A
soul
as

Pray

Those

CAMPEIUS
Madam

You

With

A

As

into

ever
casts
Such
doubts
as
false

The

Beware

For

To

You

Pray

He

While

Enter
the
DUKE
OF

the
DUKE
OF

the
EARL
OF
SURREY
and
the
LORD
CHAMBERLAIN
NORFOLK
If
you
will
now
unite
in
your
complaints
And
force
them
with
a
constancy
the
Cardinal
Cannot
stand
under
them
if
you
omit
The
offer
of
this
time
I
cannot
promise
But
that
you
shall
sustain
moe
new
disgraces
With
these
you
bear
already
SURREY
I
am
joyful
To
meet
the
least
occasion
that
may
give
me
Remembrance
of
my
father
in
law
the
Duke
To
be
reveng
d
on
him
SUFFOLK
Which
of
the
peers
Have
uncontemn
d
gone
by
him
or
at
least
Strangely
neglected
When
did
he
regard
The
stamp
of
nobleness
in
any
person
Out
of
himself
CHAMBERLAIN
My
lords
you
speak
your
pleasures
What
he
deserves
of
you
and
me
I
know
What
we
can
do
to
him
though
now
the
time
Gives
way
to
us
I
much
fear
If
you
cannot
Bar
his
access
to
th
King
never
attempt
Anything
on
him
for
he
hath
a
witchcraft
Over
the
King
in
s
tongue
NORFOLK
O
fear
him
not
His
spell
in
that
is
out
the
King
hath
found
Matter
against
him
that
for
ever
mars
The
honey
of
his
language
No
he
s
settled
Not
to
come
off
in
his
displeasure
SURREY
Sir
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
such
news
as
this
Once
every
hour
NORFOLK
Believe
it
this
is
true
In
the
divorce
his
contrary
proceedings
Are
all
unfolded
wherein
he
appears
As
I
would
wish
mine
enemy
SURREY
How
came
His
practices
to
light
SUFFOLK
Most
Strangely
SURREY
O
how
how
SUFFOLK
The
Cardinal
s
letters
to
the
Pope
miscarried
And
came
to
th
eye
o
th
King
wherein
was
read
How
that
the
Cardinal
did
entreat
his
Holiness
To
stay
the
judgment
o
th
divorce
for
if
It
did
take
place
I
do
quoth
he
perceive
My
king
is
tangled
in
affection
to
A
creature
of
the
Queen
s
Lady
Anne
Bullen
SURREY
Has
the
King
this
SUFFOLK
Believe
it
SURREY
Will
this
work
CHAMBERLAIN
The
King
in
this
perceives
him
how
he
coasts
And
hedges
his
own
way
But
in
this
point
All
his
tricks
founder
and
he
brings
his
physic
After
his
patient
s
death
the
King
already
Hath
married
the
fair
lady
SURREY
Would
he
had
SUFFOLK
May
you
be
happy
in
your
wish
my

For
I
profess
you

Now

Trace

To
some

unrecounted
But
my
lords
She

a
gallant

and
complete
In

I
persuade
me
from
her
Will
fall
some
blessing
to
this
land
which
shall
In

But
will
the

Digest

When

opinions
which
Have
satisfied

snuff

Then
out

goes
What
though
I
know
her
virtuous
And
well
deserving
Yet
I
know
her
for
A
spleeny
Lutheran
and
not
wholesome
to
Our

that

The

SUFFOLK
The

KING
What
piles
of

accumulated
To

And
what

Seems
to

How

Does

rake
this
together
Now
my
lords
Saw
you
the
Cardinal
NORFOLK
My
lord
we
have
Stood
here
observing
him
Some
strange
commotion
Is
in
his
brain
he
bites
his
lip
and
starts
Stops
on
a
sudden
looks
upon
the
ground
Then
lays
his
finger
on
his
temple
straight
Springs
out
into
fast
gait
then
stops
again
Strikes
his
breast
hard
and
anon
he
casts
His
eye
against
the
moon
In
most
strange
postures
We
have
seen
him
set
himself
KING
It
may
well
be
There
is
a
mutiny
in
s
mind
This
morning
Papers
of
state
he
sent
me
to
peruse
As
I
requir
d
and
wot
you
what
I
found
There
on
my
conscience
put
unwittingly
Forsooth
an
inventory
thus
importing
The
several
parcels
of
his
plate
his
treasure
Rich
stuffs
and
ornaments
of
household
which
I
find
at
such
proud
rate
that
it
outspeaks
Possession
of
a
subject
NORFOLK
It
s
heaven
s
will
Some
spirit
put
this
paper
in
the
packet
To
bless
your
eye
withal
KING
If
we
did
think
His
contemplation
were
above
the
earth
And
fix
d
on
spiritual
object
he
should
still
dwell
in
his
musings
but
I
am
afraid
His
thinkings
are
below
the
moon
not
worth
His
serious
considering
The
KING
takes
his
seat
and
whispers
LOVELL
who
goes
to
the
CARDINAL
WOLSEY
Heaven
forgive
me
Ever
God
bless
your
Highness
KING
Good

Of

To

For

To

require
Her
times
of

perforce

Must
give

Beyond

That

More

Though

Abound

Appear

Exit

How

He

Leap

Upon

Of

For

to

from
his
brains
I
know
twill
stir
him
strongly
yet
I
know
A
way
if
it
take
right
in
spite
of
fortune
Will
bring
me
off
again
What
s
this
To
th
Pope
The
letter
as
I
live
with
all
the
business
I
writ
to
s
Holiness
Nay
then
farewell
I
have
touch
d
the
highest
point
of
all
my
greatness
And
from
that
full
meridian
of
my
glory
I
haste
now
to
my
setting
I
shall
fall
Like
a
bright
exhalation
in
the
evening
And
no
man
see
me
more
Re
enter
to
WOLSEY
the
DUKES
OF
NORFOLK
and
SUFFOLK
the
EARL
OF
SURREY
and
the
LORD
CHAMBERLAIN
NORFOLK
Hear
the
King
s
pleasure
Cardinal
who
commands
you
To
render
up
the
great
seal
presently
Into
our
hands
and
to
confine
yourself
To
Asher
House
my
Lord
of
Winchester
s
Till
you
hear
further
from
his
Highness
WOLSEY
Stay
Where
s
your
commission
lords
Words
cannot
carry
Authority
so
weighty
SUFFOLK
Who
dares
cross
em
Bearing
the
King
s
will
from
his
mouth
expressly
WOLSEY
Till
I
find
more
than
will
or
words
to
do
it
I
mean
your
malice
know
officious
lords
I
dare
and
must
deny
it
Now
I
feel
Of
what
coarse
metal
ye
are
moulded
envy
How
eagerly
ye
follow
my
disgraces
As
if
it
fed
ye
and
how
sleek
and
wanton
Ye
appear
in
every
thing
may
bring
my
ruin
Follow
your
envious
courses
men
of
malice
You
have
Christian
warrant
for
em
and
no
doubt
In
time
will
find
their
fit
rewards
That
seal
You
ask
with
such
a
violence
the
King
Mine
and
your
master
with
his
own
hand
gave
me
Bade
me
enjoy
it
with
the
place
and
honours
During
my
life
and
to
confirm
his
goodness
Tied
it
by
letters
patents
Now
who
ll
take
it
SURREY
The
King
that
gave
it
WOLSEY
It
must
be
himself
then
SURREY
Thou
art
a
proud
traitor
priest
WOLSEY
Proud
lord
thou
liest
Within
these
forty
hours
Surrey
durst
better
Have
burnt
that
tongue
than
said
so
SURREY
Thy
ambition
Thou
scarlet
sin
robb
d
this
bewailing
land
Of
noble
Buckingham
my
father
in
law
The
heads
of
all
thy
brother
cardinals
With
thee
and
all
thy
best
parts
bound
together
Weigh
d
not
a
hair
of
his
Plague
of
your
policy
You
sent
me
deputy
for
Ireland
Far
from
his
succour
from
the
King
from
all
That
might
have
mercy
on
the
fault
thou
gav
st
him
Whilst
your
great
goodness
out
of
holy
pity
Absolv
d
him
with
an
axe
WOLSEY
This
and
all
else
This
talking
lord
can
lay
upon
my
credit
I
answer
is
most
false
The
Duke
by
law
Found
his
deserts
how
innocent
I
was
From
any
private
malice
in
his
end
His
noble
jury
and
foul
cause
can
witness
If
I
lov
d
many
words
lord
I
should
tell
you
You
have
as
little
honesty
as
honour
That
in
the
way
of
loyalty
and
truth
Toward
the
King
my
ever
royal
master
Dare
mate
a
sounder
man
than
Surrey
can
be
And
an
that
love
his
follies
SURREY
By
my
soul
Your
long
coat
priest
protects
you
thou
shouldst
feel
My
sword
i
the
life
blood
of
thee
else
My
lords
Can
ye
endure
to
hear
this
arrogance
And
from
this
fellow
If
we
live
thus
tamely
To
be
thus
jaded
by
a
piece
of
scarlet
Farewell
nobility
Let
his
Grace
go
forward
And
dare
us
with
his
cap
like
larks
WOLSEY
All
goodness
Is
poison
to
thy
stomach
SURREY
Yes
that
goodness
Of
gleaning
all
the
land
s
wealth
into
one
Into
your
own
hands
Cardinal
by
extortion
The
goodness
of
your
intercepted
packets
You
writ
to
th
Pope
against
the
King
your
goodness
Since
you
provoke
me
shall
be
most
notorious
My
Lord
of
Norfolk
as
you
are
truly
noble
As
you
respect
the
common
good
the
state
Of
our
despis
d
nobility
our
issues
Whom
if
he
live
will
scarce
be
gentlemen
Produce
the
grand
sum
of
his
sins
the
articles
Collected
from
his
life
I
ll
startle
you
Worse
than
the
sacring
bell
when
the
brown
wench
Lay
kissing
in
your
arms
Lord
Cardinal
WOLSEY
How
much
methinks
I
could
despise
this
man
But
that
I
am
bound
in
charity
against
it
NORFOLK
Those
articles
my
lord
are
in
the
King
s
hand
But
thus
much
they
are
foul
ones
WOLSEY
So
much
fairer
And
spotless
shall
mine
innocence
arise
When
the
King
knows
my
truth
SURREY
This
cannot
save
you
I
thank
my
memory
I
yet
remember
Some
of
these
articles
and
out
they
shall
Now
if
you
can
blush
and
cry
guilty
Cardinal
You
ll
show
a
little
honesty
WOLSEY
Speak
on
sir
I
dare
your
worst
objections
If
I
blush
It
is
to
see
a
nobleman
want
manners
SURREY
I
had
rather
want
those
than
my
head
Have
at
you
First
that
without
the
King
s
assent
or
knowledge
You
wrought
to
be
a
legate
by
which
power
You
maim
d
the
jurisdiction
of
all
bishops
NORFOLK
Then
that
in
all
you
writ
to
Rome
or
else
To
foreign
princes
Ego
et
Rex
meus
Was
still
inscrib
d
in
which
you
brought
the
King
To
be
your
servant
SUFFOLK
Then
that
without
the
knowledge
Either
of
King
or
Council
when
you
went
Ambassador
to
the
Emperor
you
made
bold
To
carry
into
Flanders
the
great
seal
SURREY
Item
you
sent
a
large
commission
To
Gregory
de
Cassado
to
conclude
Without
the
King
s
will
or
the
state
s
allowance
A
league
between
his
Highness
and
Ferrara
SUFFOLK
That
out
of
mere
ambition
you
have
caus
d
Your
holy
hat
to
be
stamp
d
on
the
King
s
coin
SURREY
Then
that
you
have
sent
innumerable
substance
By
what
means
got
I
leave
to
your
own
conscience
To
furnish
Rome
and
to
prepare
the
ways
You
have
for
dignities
to
the
mere
undoing
Of
all
the
kingdom
Many
more
there
are
Which
since
they
are
of
you
and
odious
I
will
not
taint
my
mouth
with
CHAMBERLAIN
O
my
lord
Press
not
a
falling
man
too
far
Tis
virtue
His
faults
lie
open
to
the
laws
let
them
Not
you
correct
him
My
heart
weeps
to
see
him
So
little
of
his
great
self
SURREY
I
forgive
him
SUFFOLK
Lord
Cardinal
the
King
s
further
pleasure
is
Because
all
those
things
you
have
done
of
late
By
your
power
legatine
within
this
kingdom
