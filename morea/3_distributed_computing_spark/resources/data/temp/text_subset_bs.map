Touching
this
dreaded
sight
twice
seen
of
us
Therefore
I
have
entreated
him
along
With
us
to
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night
That
if
again
this
apparition
come
He
may
approve
our
eyes
and
speak
to
it
Hor
Tush
tush
twill
not
appear
Ber
Sit
down
awhile
And
let
us
once
again
assail
your
ears
That
are
so
fortified
against
our
story
What
we
two
nights
have
seen
Hor
Well
sit
we
down
And
let
us
hear
Bernardo
speak
of
this
Ber
Last
night
of
all
When
yond
same
star
that
s
westward
from
the
pole
Had
made
his
course
t
illume
that
part
of
heaven
Where
now
it
burns
Marcellus
and
myself
The
bell
then
beating
one
Enter
Ghost
Mar
Peace
break
thee
off
Look
where
it
comes
again
Ber
In
the
same
figure
like
the
King
that
s
dead
Mar
Thou
art
a
scholar
speak
to
it
Horatio
Ber
Looks
it
not
like
the
King
Mark
it
Horatio
Hor
Most
like
It
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
Ber
It
would
be
spoke
to
Mar
Question
it
Horatio
Hor
What
art
thou
that
usurp
st
this
time
of
night
Together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
In
which
the
majesty
of
buried
Denmark
Did
sometimes
march
By
heaven
I
charge
thee
speak
Mar
It
is
offended
Ber
See
it
stalks
away
Hor
Stay
Speak
speak
I
charge
thee
speak
Exit
Ghost
Mar
Tis
gone
and
will
not
answer
Ber
How
now
Horatio
You
tremble
and
look
pale
Is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
What
think
you
on
t
Hor
Before
my
God
I
might
not
this
believe
Without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
Of
mine
own
eyes
Mar
Is
it
not
like
the
King
Hor
As
thou
art
to
thyself
Such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
When
he
th
ambitious
Norway
combated
So
frown
d
he
once
when
in
an
angry
parle
He
smote
the
sledded
Polacks
on
the
ice
Tis
strange
Mar
Thus
twice
before
and
jump
at
this
dead
hour
With
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
Hor
In
what
particular
thought
to
work
I
know
not
But
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
This
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
Mar
Good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
Why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
So
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
And
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
And
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
Why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
Does
not
divide
the
Sunday
from
the
week
What
might
be
toward
that
this
sweaty
haste
Doth
make
the
night
joint
labourer
with
the
day
Who
is
t
that
can
inform
me
Hor
That
can
I
At
least
the
whisper
goes
so
Our
last
king
Whose
image
even
but
now
appear
d
to
us
Was
as
you
know
by
Fortinbras
of
Norway
Thereto
prick
d
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
Dar
d
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
Hamlet
For
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteem
d
him
Did
slay
this
Fortinbras
who
by
a
seal
d
compact
Well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
Did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
Which
he
stood
seiz
d
of
to
the
conqueror
Against
the
which
a
moiety
competent
Was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
return
d
To
the
inheritance
of
Fortinbras
Had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
comart
And
carriage
of
the
article
design
d
His
fell
to
Hamlet
Now
sir
young
Fortinbras
Of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
Hath
in
the
skirts
of
Norway
here
and
there
Shark
d
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
For
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
That
hath
a
stomach
in
t
which
is
no
other
As
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
But
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
And
terms
compulsatory
those
foresaid
lands
So
by
his
father
lost
and
this
I
take
it
Is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
The
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
Of
this
post
haste
and
romage
in
the
land
Ber
I
think
it
be
no
other
but
e
en
so
Well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
Comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
King
That
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
Hor
A
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
mind
s
eye
In
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
Rome
A
little
ere
the
mightiest
Julius
fell
The
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
Did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
Roman
streets
As
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood
Disasters
in
the
sun
and
the
moist
star
Upon
whose
influence
Neptune
s
empire
stands
Was
sick
almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse
And
even
the
like
precurse
of
fierce
events
As
harbingers
preceding
still
the
fates
And
prologue
to
the
omen
coming
on
Have
heaven
and
earth
together
demonstrated
Unto
our
climature
and
countrymen
Enter
Ghost
again
But
soft
behold
Lo
where
it
comes
again
I
ll
cross
it
though
it
blast
me
Stay
illusion
Spreads
his
arms
If
thou
hast
any
sound
or
use
of
voice
Speak
to
me
If
there
be
any
good
thing
to
be
done
That
may
to
thee
do
ease
and
race
to
me
Speak
to
me
If
thou
art
privy
to
thy
country
s
fate
Which
happily
foreknowing
may
avoid
O
speak
Or
if
thou
hast
uphoarded
in
thy
life
Extorted
treasure
in
the
womb
of
earth
For
which
they
say
you
spirits
oft
walk
in
death
The
cock
crows
Speak
of
it
Stay
and
speak
Stop
it
Marcellus

Shall
I
strike
at
it
with
my
partisan
Hor
Do
if
it
will
not
stand
Ber
Tis
here
Hor
Tis
here
Mar
Tis
gone
Exit
Ghost
We
do
it
wrong
being
so
majestical
To
offer
it
the
show
of
violence
For
it
is
as
the
air
invulnerable
And
our
vain
blows
malicious
mockery
Ber
It
was
about
to
speak
when
the
cock
crew
Hor
And
then
it
started
like
a
guilty
thing
Upon
a
fearful
summons
I
have
heard
The
cock
that
is
the
trumpet
to
the
morn
Doth
with
his
lofty
and
shrill
sounding
throat
Awake
the
god
of
day
and
at
his
warning
Whether
in
sea
or
fire
in
earth
or
air
Th
extravagant
and
erring
spirit
hies
To
his
confine
and
of
the
truth
herein
This
present
object
made
probation
Mar
It
faded
on
the
crowing
of
the
cock
Some
say
that
ever
gainst
that
season
comes
Wherein
our
Saviour
s
birth
is
celebrated
The
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
And
then
they
say
no
spirit
dare
stir
abroad
The
nights
are
wholesome
then
no
planets
strike
No
fairy
takes
nor
witch
hath
power
to
charm
So
hallow
d
and
so
gracious
is
the
time
Hor
So
have
I
heard
and
do
in
part
believe
it
But
look
the
morn
in
russet
mantle
clad
Walks
o
er
the
dew
of
yon
high
eastward
hill
Break
we
our
watch
up
and
by
my
advice
Let
us
impart
what
we
have
seen
to
night
Unto
young
Hamlet
for
upon
my
life
This
spirit
dumb
to
us
will
speak
to
him
Do
you
consent
we
shall
acquaint
him
with
it
As
needful
in
our
loves
fitting
our
duty
Let
s
do
t
I
pray
and
I
this
morning
know
Where
we
shall
find
him
most
conveniently
Exeunt
Scene
II
Elsinore
A
room
of
state
in
the
Castle
Flourish
Enter
Claudius
King
of
Denmark
Gertrude
the
Queen
Hamlet
Polonius
Laertes
and
his
sister
Ophelia
Voltemand
Cornelius
Lords
Attendant
King
Though
yet
of
Hamlet
our
dear
brother
s
death
The
memory
be
green
and
that
it
us
befitted
To
bear
our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
To
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
Yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
That
we
with
wisest
sorrow
think
on
him
Together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
Therefore
our
sometime
sister
now
our
queen
Th
imperial
jointress
to
this
warlike
state
Have
we
as
twere
with
a
defeated
joy
With
an
auspicious
and
a
dropping
eye
With
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in
marriage
In
equal
scale
weighing
delight
and
dole
Taken
to
wife
nor
have
we
herein
barr
d
Your
better
wisdoms
which
have
freely
gone
With
this
affair
along
For
all
our
thanks
Now
follows
that
you
know
young
Fortinbras
Holding
a
weak
supposal
of
our
worth
Or
thinking
by
our
late
dear
brother
s
death
Our
state
to
be
disjoint
and
out
of
frame
Colleagued
with
this
dream
of
his
advantage
He
hath
not
fail
d
to
pester
us
with
message
Importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
Lost
by
his
father
with
all
bands
of
law
To
our
most
valiant
brother
So
much
for
him
Now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
Thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
To
Norway
uncle
of
young
Fortinbras
Who
impotent
and
bedrid
scarcely
hears
Of
this
his
nephew
s
purpose
to
suppress
His
further
gait
herein
in
that
the
levies
The
lists
and
full
proportions
are
all
made
Out
of
his
subject
and
we
here
dispatch
You
good
Cornelius
and
you
Voltemand
For
bearers
of
this
greeting
to
old
Norway
Giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
To
business
with
the
King
more
than
the
scope
Of
these
dilated
articles
allow
Gives
a
paper
Farewell
and
let
your
haste
commend
your
duty
Cor
Volt
In
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty
King
We
doubt
it
nothing
Heartily
farewell
Exeunt
Voltemand
and
Cornelius
And
now
Laertes
what
s
the
news
with
you
You
told
us
of
some
suit
What
is
t
Laertes
You
cannot
speak
of
reason
to
the
Dane
And
lose
your
voice
What
wouldst
thou
beg
Laertes
That
shall
not
be
my
offer
not
thy
asking
The
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
The
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
Than
is
the
throne
of
Denmark
to
thy
father
What
wouldst
thou
have
Laertes
Laer
My
dread
lord
Your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
France
From
whence
though
willingly
I
came
to
Denmark
To
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
Yet
now
I
must
confess
that
duty
done
My
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
France
And
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
King
Have
you
your
father
s
leave
What
says
Polonius
Pol
He
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
By
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
Upon
his
will
I
seal
d
my
hard
consent
I
do
beseech
you
give
him
leave
to
go
King
Take
thy
fair
hour
Laertes
Time
be
thine
And
thy
best
graces
spend
it
at
thy
will
But
now
my
cousin
Hamlet
and
my
son
Ham
aside
A
little
more
than
kin
and
less
than
kind
King
How
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
Ham
Not
so
my
lord
I
am
too
much
i
th
sun
Queen
Good
Hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
And
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
Denmark
Do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
Seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
Thou
know
st
tis
common
All
that
lives
must
die
Passing
through
nature
to
eternity
Ham
Ay
madam
it
is
common
Queen
If
it
be
Why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
Ham
Seems
madam
Nay
it
is
I
know
not
seems
Tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
Nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
Nor
windy
suspiration
of
forc
d
breath
No
nor
the
fruitful
river
in
the
eye
Nor
the
dejected
havior
of
the
visage
Together
with
all
forms
moods
shapes
of
grief
That
can
denote
me
truly
These
indeed
seem
For
they
are
actions
that
a
man
might
play
But
I
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
These
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
King
Tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
Hamlet
To
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
But
you
must
know
your
father
lost
a
father
That
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
In
filial
obligation
for
some
term
To
do
obsequious
sorrow
But
to
persever
In
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
Of
impious
stubbornness
Tis
unmanly
grief
It
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
A
heart
unfortified
a
mind
impatient
An
understanding
simple
and
unschool
d
For
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
As
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
Why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
Take
it
to
heart
Fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
A
fault
against
the
dead
a
fault
to
nature
To
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
Is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
From
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
to
day
This
must
be
so
We
pray
you
throw
to
earth
This
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
As
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
You
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
And
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
Than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
Do
I
impart
toward
you
For
your
intent
In
going
back
to
school
in
Wittenberg
It
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
And
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
Here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
Our
chiefest
courtier
cousin
and
our
son
Queen
Let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
Hamlet
I
pray
thee
stay
with
us
go
not
to
Wittenberg
Ham
I
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
madam
King
Why
tis
a
loving
and
a
fair
reply
Be
as
ourself
in
Denmark
Madam
come
This
gentle
and
unforc
d
accord
of
Hamlet
Sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
No
jocund
health
that
Denmark
drinks
to
day
But
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
And
the
King
s
rouse
the
heaven
shall
bruit
again
Respeaking
earthly
thunder
Come
away
Flourish
Exeunt
all
but
Hamlet
Ham
O
that
this
too
too
solid
flesh
would
melt
Thaw
and
resolve
itself
into
a
dew
Or
that
the
Everlasting
had
not
fix
d
His
canon
gainst

slaughter
O
God
God
How
weary
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
Seem
to
me
all
the
uses
of
this
world
Fie
on
t
ah
fie
Tis
an
unweeded
garden
That
grows
to
seed
things
rank
and
gross
in
nature
Possess
it
merely
That
it
should
come
to
this
But
two
months
dead
Nay
not
so
much
not
two
So
excellent
a
king
that
was
to
this
Hyperion
to
a
satyr
so
loving
to
my
mother
That
he
might
not
beteem
the
winds
of
heaven
Visit
her
face
too
roughly
Heaven
and
earth
Must
I
remember
Why
she
would
hang
on
him
As
if
increase
of
appetite
had
grown
By
what
it
fed
on
and
yet
within
a
month
Let
me
not
think
on
t
Frailty
thy
name
is
woman
A
little
month
or
ere
those
shoes
were
old
With
which
she
followed
my
poor
father
s
body
Like
Niobe
all
tears
why
she
even
she
O
God
a
beast
that
wants
discourse
of
reason
Would
have
mourn
d
longer
married
with
my
uncle
My
father
s
brother
but
no
more
like
my
father
Than
I
to
Hercules
Within
a
month
Ere
yet
the
salt
of
most
unrighteous
tears
Had
left
the
flushing
in
her
galled
eyes
She
married
O
most
wicked
speed
to
post
With
such
dexterity
to
incestuous
sheets
It
is
not
nor
it
cannot
come
to
good
But
break
my
heart
for
I
must
hold
my
tongue
Enter
Horatio
Marcellus
and
Bernardo
Hor
Hail
to
your
lordship
Ham
I
am
glad
to
see
you
well
Horatio
or
I
do
forget
myself
Hor
The
same
my
lord
and
your
poor
servant
ever
Ham
Sir
my
good
friend
I
ll
change
that
name
with
you
And
what
make
you
from
Wittenberg
Horatio

My
good
lord
Ham
I
am
very
glad

see
you
To

faith
make
you
from
Wittenberg
Hor
A
truant
disposition
good
my
lord
Ham
I
would
not
hear
your
enemy
say
so
Nor
shall
you
do
my
ear
that
violence
To
make
it
truster
of
your
own
report
Against
yourself
I
know
you
are
no
truant
But
what
is
your
affair
in
Elsinore
We
ll
teach
you
to
drink
deep
ere
you
depart
Hor
My
lord
I
came
to
see
your
father
s
funeral
Ham
I
prithee
do
not
mock
me
fellow
student
I
think
it
was
to
see
my
mother
s
wedding
Hor
Indeed
my
lord
it
followed
hard
upon
Ham
Thrift

The

Would
I
had
met

Or

I
had
seen
that
day
Horatio
My

methinks
I
see

O
where
my
lord
Ham
In
my
mind

Horatio
Hor
I
saw
him
once
He
was
a
goodly
king
Ham
He
was
a
man
take
him
for

in

I
shall
not
look
upon

yesternight

With

Upon
the
witness
of
these
gentlemen
This
marvel
to
you
Ham
For
God
s
love
let
me
hear
Hor
Two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
Marcellus
and
Bernardo
on
their
watch
In
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
Been
thus
encount

A
figure
like

father
Armed
at
point

Appears
before

and
with
solemn
march
Goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
Thrice

Within

whilst
they

Almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
Stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
This
to
me
In
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
And
I
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
Where
as
they
had
deliver
d
both
in
time
Form
of
the
thing
each
word
made
true
and
good
The
apparition
comes
I
knew
your
father
These
hands
are
not
more
like
Ham
But
where
was
this
Mar
My
lord
upon
the
platform
where
we
watch
d
Ham
Did
you
not
speak
to
it
Hor
My
lord
I
did
But
answer
made
it
none
Yet
once
methought
It
lifted
up
it
head
and
did
address
Itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
But
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
And
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
And
vanish
d
from
our
sight
Ham
Tis
very
strange
Hor
As
I
do
live
my
honour
d
lord
tis
true
And
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
To
let
you
know
of
it
Ham
Indeed
indeed
sirs
But
this
troubles
me
Hold

watch
to

From

from

Then
saw
you
not
his
face
Hor
O
yes
my
lord
He
wore
his
beaver
up
Ham
What
look
d
he
frowningly
Hor
A
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
Ham
Pale
or
red
Hor
Nay
very
pale
Ham
And
fix

his
eyes
upon

Hor
Most
constantly

I

It
would

If

And

If

Let
it
be
tenable

silence

And
whatsoever
else
shall
hap

Give
it

understanding

no

So

Upon

Farewell

foul

Would

Till

Foul

Do
you
doubt
that
Laer
For
Hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
Hold
it
a
fashion
and
a
toy
in
blood
A
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
Forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
The
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
No
more
Oph
No
more
but
so
Laer
Think
it
no
more
For
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
In
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
The
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
Grows
wide
withal
Perhaps
he
loves
you
now
And
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
The
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
His
greatness
weigh
d
his
will
is
not
his
own
For
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
He
may
not
as
unvalued
persons
do
Carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
The
safety
and
health
of
this
whole
state
And
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscrib
d
Unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
Whereof
he
is
the
head
Then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
It
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
As
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
May
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
Than
the
main
voice
of
Denmark
goes
withal
Then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
If
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
Or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
To
his
unmast
red
importunity
Fear
it
Ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
And
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
Out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
The
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
If
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
Virtue
itself
scopes
not
calumnious
strokes
The
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
Too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclos

And
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
Contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent
Be

lies
in
fear
Youth
