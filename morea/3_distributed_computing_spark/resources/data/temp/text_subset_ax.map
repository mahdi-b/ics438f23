Were
man
as
rare
as
Phoenix
Od
s
my
will
Her
love
is
not
the
hare
that
I
do
hunt
Why
writes
she
so
to
me
Well
shepherd
well
This
is
a
letter
of
your
own
device
SILVIUS
No
I
protest
I
know
not
the
contents
Phebe
did
write
it
ROSALIND
Come
come
you
are
a
fool
And
turn
d
into
the
extremity
of
love
I
saw
her
hand
she
has
a
leathern
hand
A
freestone
colour
d
hand
I
verily
did
think
That
her
old
gloves
were
on
but
twas
her
hands
She
has
a
huswife
s
hand
but
that
s
no
matter
I
say
she
never
did
invent
this
letter
This
is
a
man
s
invention
and
his
hand
SILVIUS
Sure
it
is
hers
ROSALIND
Why
tis
a
boisterous
and
a
cruel
style
A
style
for
challengers
Why
she
defies
me
Like
Turk
to
Christian
Women
s
gentle
brain
Could
not
drop
forth
such
giant
rude
invention
Such
Ethiope
words
blacker
in
their
effect
Than
in
their
countenance
Will
you
hear
the
letter
SILVIUS
So
please
you
for
I
never
heard
it
yet
Yet
heard
too
much
of
Phebe
s
cruelty
ROSALIND
She
Phebes
me
mark
how
the
tyrant
writes
Reads
Art
thou
god
to
shepherd
turn
d
That
a
maiden
s
heart
hath
burn
d
Can
a
woman
rail
thus
SILVIUS
Call
you
this
railing
ROSALIND
Why
thy
godhead
laid
apart
Warr
st
thou
with
a
woman
s
heart
Did
you
ever
hear
such
railing
Whiles
the
eye
of
man
did
woo
me
That
could
do
no
vengeance
to
me
Meaning
me
a
beast
If
the
scorn
of
your
bright
eyne
Have
power
to
raise
such
love
in
mine
Alack
in
me
what
strange
effect
Would
they
work
in
mild
aspect
Whiles
you
chid
me
I
did
love
How
then
might
your
prayers
move
He
that
brings
this
love
to
the
Little
knows
this
love
in
me
And
by
him
seal
up
thy
mind
Whether
that
thy
youth
and
kind
Will
the
faithful
offer
take
Of
me
and
all
that
I
can
make
Or
else
by
him
my
love
deny
And
then
I
ll
study
how
to
die
SILVIUS
Call
you
this
chiding
CELIA
Alas
poor
shepherd
ROSALIND
Do
you
pity
him
No
he
deserves
no
pity
Wilt
thou
love
such
a
woman
What
to
make
thee
an
instrument
and
play
false
strains
upon
thee
Not
to
be
endur
d
Well
go
your
way
to
her
for
I
see
love
hath
made
thee
tame
snake
and
say
this
to
her
that
if
she
love
me
I
charge
her
to
love
thee
if
she
will
not
I
will
never
have
her
unless
thou
entreat
for
her
If
you
be
a
true
lover
hence
and
not
a
word
for
here
comes
more
company
Exit
SILVIUS

OLIVER
OLIVER
Good
morrow
fair
ones
pray
you
if
you
know
Where
in
the
purlieus
of
this
forest
stands
A
sheep
cote
fenc
d
about
with
olive
trees
CELIA
West
of
this
place
down
in
the
neighbour
bottom
The
rank
of
osiers
by
the
murmuring
stream
Left
on
your
right
hand
brings
you
to
the
place
But
at
this
hour
the
house
doth
keep
itself
There
s
none
within
OLIVER
If
that
an
eye
may
profit
by
a
tongue
Then
should
I
know
you
by
description
Such
garments
and
such
years
The
boy
is
fair
Of
female
favour
and
bestows
himself
Like
a
ripe
sister
the
woman
low
And
browner
than
her
brother
Are
not
you
The
owner
of
the
house
I
did
inquire
for
CELIA
It
is
no
boast
being
ask
d
to
say
we
are
OLIVER
Orlando
doth
commend
him
to
you
both
And
to
that
youth
he
calls
his
Rosalind
He
sends
this
bloody
napkin
Are
you
he
ROSALIND
I
am
What
must
we
understand
by
this
OLIVER
Some
of
my
shame
if
you
will
know
of
me
What
man
I
am
and
how
and
why
and
where
This
handkercher
was
stain
d
CELIA
I
pray
you
tell
it
OLIVER
When
last
the
young
Orlando
parted
from
you
He
left
a
promise
to
return
again
Within
an
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
Chewing
the
food
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
Lo
what
befell
He
threw
his
eye
aside
And
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
Under
an
oak
whose
boughs
were
moss
d
with
age
And
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
A
wretched
ragged
man
o
ergrown
with
hair
Lay
sleeping
on
his
back
About
his
neck
A
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreath
d
itself
Who
with
her
head
nimble
in
threats
approach
d
The
opening
of
his
mouth
but
suddenly
Seeing
Orlando
it
unlink
d
itself
And
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
Into
a
bush
under
which
bush
s
shade
A
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
Lay
couching
head
on
ground
with
catlike
watch
When
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
The
royal
disposition
of
that
beast
To
prey
on
nothing
that
doth
seem
as
dead
This
seen
Orlando
did
approach
the
man
And
found
it
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
CELIA
O
I
have
heard
him
speak
of
that
same
brother
And
he
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
That
liv
d
amongst
men
OLIVER
And
well
he
might
so
do
For
well
I
know
he
was
unnatural
ROSALIND
But
to
Orlando
did
he
leave
him
there
Food
to
the
suck
d
and
hungry
lioness
OLIVER
Twice
did
he
turn
his
back
and
purpos
d
so
But
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
And
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
Made
him
give
battle
to
the
lioness
Who
quickly
fell
before
him
in
which
hurtling
From
miserable
slumber
I
awak
d
CELIA
Are
you
his
brother
ROSALIND
Was
t
you
he
rescu
d
CELIA
Was
t
you
that
did
so
oft
contrive
to
kill
him
OLIVER
Twas
I
but
tis
not
I
I
do
not
shame
To
tell
you
what
I
was
since
my
conversion
So
sweetly
tastes
being
the
thing
I
am
ROSALIND
But
for
the
bloody
napkin
OLIVER
By
and
by
When
from
the
first
to
last
betwixt
us
two
Tears
our
recountments
had
most
kindly
bath
d
As
how
I
came
into
that
desert
place
In
brief
he
led
me
to
the
gentle
Duke
Who
gave
me
fresh
array
and
entertainment
Committing
me
unto
my
brother
s
love
Who
led
me
instantly
unto
his
cave
There
stripp
d
himself
and
here
upon
his
arm
The
lioness
had
torn
some
flesh
away
Which
all
this
while
had
bled
and
now
he
fainted
And
cried
in
fainting
upon
Rosalind
Brief
I
recover
d
him
bound
up
his
wound
And
after
some
small
space
being
strong
at
heart
He
sent
me
hither
stranger
as
I
am
To
tell
this
story
that
you
might
excuse
His
broken
promise
and
to
give
this
napkin
Dy
d
in
his
blood
unto
the
shepherd
youth
That
he
in
sport
doth
call
his
Rosalind
ROSALIND
swoons
CELIA
Why
how
now
Ganymede
sweet
Ganymede
OLIVER
Many
will
swoon
when
they
do
look
on
blood
CELIA
There
is
more
in
it
Cousin
Ganymede
OLIVER
Look
he
recovers
ROSALIND
I
would
I
were
at
home
CELIA
We
ll
lead
you
thither
I
pray
you
will
you
take
him
by
the
arm
OLIVER
Be
of
good
cheer
youth
You
a
man
You
lack
a
man
s
heart
ROSALIND
I
do
so
I
confess
it
Ah
sirrah
a
body
would
think
this
was
well
counterfeited
I
pray
you
tell
your
brother
how
well
I
counterfeited
Heigh
ho
OLIVER
This
was
not
counterfeit
there
is
too
great
testimony
in
your
complexion
that
it
was
a
passion
of
earnest
ROSALIND
Counterfeit
I
assure
you
OLIVER
Well
then
take
a
good
heart
and
counterfeit
to
be
a
man
ROSALIND
So
I
do
but
i
faith
I
should
have
been
a
woman
by
right
CELIA
Come
you
look
paler
and
paler
pray
you
draw
homewards
Good
sir
go
with
us
OLIVER
That
will
I
for
I
must
bear
answer
back
How
you
excuse
my
brother
Rosalind
ROSALIND
I
shall
devise
something
but
I
pray
you
commend
my
counterfeiting
to
him
Will
you

The
heathen

grape
would
open
his
lips

ORLANDO
and
OLIVER
ORLANDO
Is
t
possible
that
on
so
little
acquaintance
you
should
like
her
that
but
seeing
you
should
love
her
and
loving
woo
and
wooing
she
should
grant
and
will
you
persever
to
enjoy
her
OLIVER
Neither
call
the
giddiness
of
it
in
question
the
poverty
of
her
the
small
acquaintance
my
sudden
wooing
nor
her
sudden
consenting
but
say
with
me
I
love
Aliena
say
with
her
that
she
loves
me
consent
with
both
that
we
may
enjoy
each
other
It
shall
be
to
your
good
for
my
father
s
house
and
all
the
revenue
that
was
old
Sir
Rowland
s
will
I
estate
upon
you
and
here
live
and
die
a
shepherd
ORLANDO
You
have
my
consent
Let
your
wedding
be
to
morrow
Thither
will
I
invite
the
Duke
and
all
s
contented
followers
Go

and
prepare
Aliena

Rosalind
Enter

ROSALIND
God
save
you
brother
OLIVER
And
you
fair
sister
Exit
ROSALIND
O
my
dear
Orlando
how
it
grieves
me
to
see
thee
wear
thy
heart
in
a
scarf
ORLANDO
It
is
my
arm
ROSALIND
I
thought
thy
heart
had
been
wounded
with
the
claws
of
a
lion
ORLANDO
Wounded
it
is
but
with
the
eyes
of
a
lady
ROSALIND
Did
your
brother
tell
you
how
I
counterfeited
to
swoon
when
he
show
d
me
your
handkercher
ORLANDO
Ay
and
greater
wonders
than
that
ROSALIND
O
I
know
where
you
are
Nay
tis
true
There
was
never
any
thing
so
sudden
but
the
fight
of
two
rams
and
Caesar
s
thrasonical
brag
of
I
came
saw
and
overcame
For
your
brother
and
my
sister
no
sooner
met
but
they
look
d
no
sooner
look
d
but
they
lov
d
no
sooner
lov
d
but
they
sigh
d
no
sooner
sigh
d
but
they
ask
d
one
another
the
reason
no
sooner
knew
the
reason
but
they
sought
the
remedy
and
in
these
degrees
have
they
made
pair
of
stairs
to
marriage
which
they
will
climb
incontinent
or
else
be
incontinent
before
marriage
They
are
in
the
very
wrath
of
love
and
they
will
together
Clubs
cannot
part
them
ORLANDO
They
shall
be
married
to
morrow
and
I
will
bid
the
Duke
to
the
nuptial
But
O
how
bitter
a
thing
it
is
to
look
into
happiness
through
another
man
s
eyes
By
so
much
the
more
shall
I
to
morrow
be
at
the
height
of
heart
heaviness
by
how
much
I
shall
think
my
brother
happy
in
having
what
he
wishes
for
ROSALIND
Why
then
to
morrow
I
cannot
serve
your
turn
for
Rosalind
ORLANDO
I
can
live
no
longer
by
thinking
ROSALIND
I
will
weary
you
then
no
longer
with
idle
talking
Know
of
me
then
for
now
I
speak
to
some
purpose
that
I
know
you
are
a
gentleman
of
good
conceit
I
speak
not
this
that
you
should
bear
a
good
opinion
of
my
knowledge
insomuch
I
say
I
know
you
are
neither
do
I
labour
for
a
greater
esteem
than
may
in
some
little
measure
draw
a
belief
from
you
to
do
yourself
good
and
not
to
grace
me
Believe
then
if
you
please
that
I
can
do
strange
things
I
have
since
I
was
three
year
old
convers
d
with
a
magician
most
profound
in
his
art
and
yet
not
damnable
If
you
do
love
Rosalind
so
near
the
heart
as
your
gesture
cries
it
out
when
your
brother
marries
Aliena
shall
you
marry
her
I
know
into
what
straits
of
fortune
she
is
driven
and
it
is
not
impossible
to
me
if
it
appear
not
inconvenient
to
you
to
set
her
before
your
eyes
to
morrow
human
as
she
is
and
without
any
danger
ORLANDO
Speak
st
thou
in
sober
meanings
ROSALIND
By
my
life
I
do
which
I
tender
dearly
though
I
say
I
am
a
magician
Therefore
put
you
in
your
best
array
bid
your
friends
for
if
you
will
be
married
to
morrow
you
shall
and
to
Rosalind
if
you
will
Enter
SILVIUS

PHEBE
Look
here
comes
a
lover
of
mine
and
a

so

Circumstantial

Direct

oft
