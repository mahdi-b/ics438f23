Arms

your
last
embrace

O
you
The
doors
of
breath
seal
with
a
righteous
kiss
A
dateless
bargain
to
engrossing
death
Come
bitter

come
unsavoury
guide
Thou
desperate
pilot

at

run

The
dashing

seasick
weary
bark
Here

If

Stay

Fear

As

And

my

slew
him
Friar
Romeo
Alack
alack
what
blood
is
this
which

The
stony
entrance

What

gory

To

Enters

I
hear
some
noise
Lady

nest
Of

contagion
and
unnatural

A
greater
power

Hath

Come

Come

Alas

To

Seal

outrage
for
a

Till
we
can
clear
these
ambiguities
And
know
their
spring

true
descent
And
then
will
I
be
general
of
your
woes
And
lead
you
even
to
death
Meantime
forbear
And
let
mischance
be
slave
to
patience
Bring
forth
the
parties
of
suspicion
Friar
I
am
the
greatest
able
to
do
least
Yet
most
suspected
as
the
time
and
place
Doth
make
against
me
of
this
direful
murther
And
here
I
stand
both
to
impeach
and
purge
Myself
condemned
and
myself
excus
d
Prince
Then
say
it
once
what
thou
dost
know
in
this
Friar
I
will
be
brief
for
my
short
date
of
breath
Is
not
so
long
as
is
a
tedious
tale
Romeo
there
dead
was
husband
to
that
Juliet
And
she
there
dead
that
Romeo
s
faithful
wife
I
married
them
and
their
stol
n
marriage
day
Was
Tybalt
s
doomsday
whose
untimely
death
Banish
d
the
new
made
bridegroom
from
this
city
For
whom
and
not
for
Tybalt
Juliet
pin
d
You
to
remove
that
siege
of
grief
from
her
Betroth
d
and
would
have
married
her
perforce
To
County
Paris
Then
comes
she
to
me
And
with
wild
looks
bid
me
devise
some
mean
To
rid
her
from
this
second
marriage
Or
in
my
cell
there
would
she
kill
herself
Then
gave
I
her
so
tutored
by
my
art
A
sleeping
potion
which
so
took
effect
As
I
intended
for
it
wrought
on
her
The
form
of
death
Meantime
I
writ
to
Romeo
That
he
should
hither
come
as
this
dire
night
To
help
to
take
her
from
her
borrowed
grave
Being
the
time
the
potion
s
force
should
cease
But
he
which
bore
my
letter
Friar
John
Was
stay
d
by
accident
and
yesternight
Return
d
my
letter
back
Then
all
alone
At
the
prefixed
hour
of
her
waking
Came
I
to
take
her
from
her
kindred
s
vault
Meaning
to
keep
her
closely
at
my
cell
Till
I
conveniently
could
send
to
Romeo
But
when
I
came
some
minute
ere
the
time
Of
her
awaking
here
untimely
lay
The
noble
Paris
and
true
Romeo
dead
She
wakes
and
I
entreated
her
come
forth
And
bear
this
work
of
heaven
with
patience
But
then
a
noise
did
scare
me
from
the
tomb
And
she
too
desperate
would
not
go
with
me
But
as
it
seems
did
violence
on
herself
All
this
I
know
and
to
the
marriage
Her
nurse
is
privy
and
if
aught
in
this
Miscarried
by
my
fault
let
my
old
life
Be
sacrific
d
some
hour
before
his
time
Unto
the
rigour
of
severest
law
Prince
We
still
have
known
thee
for
a
holy
man
Where
s
Romeo
s
man
What
can
he
say
in
this
Bal
I
brought
my
master
news
of
Juliet
s
death
And
then
in
post
he
came
from
Mantua
To
this
same
place
to
this
same
monument
This
letter
he
early
bid
me
give
his
father
And
threat
ned
me
with
death
going
in
the
vault
If
I
departed
not
and
left
him
there
Prince
Give
me
the
letter
I
will
look
on
it
Where
is
the
County
s
page
that
rais
d
the
watch
Sirrah
what
made
your
master
in
this
place
Boy
He
came
with
flowers
to
strew
his
lady
s
grave
And
bid
me
stand
aloof
and
so
I
did
Anon
comes
one
with
light
to
ope
the
tomb
And
by
and
by
my
master
drew
on
him
And
then
I
ran
away
to
call
the
watch
Prince
This
letter
doth
make
good
the
friar
s
words
Their
course
of
love
the
tidings
of
her
death
And
here
he
writes
that
he
did
buy
a
poison
Of
a
poor
pothecary
and
therewithal
Came
to
this
vault
to
die
and
lie
with
Juliet
Where
be
these
enemies
Capulet
Montage
See
what
a
scourge
is
laid
upon
your
hate
That
heaven
finds
means
to
kill
your
joys
with
love
And
I
for
winking
at
you
discords
too
Have
lost
a
brace
of
kinsmen
All
are

O
brother
Montague
give
me
thy
hand
This
is
my
daughter
s
jointure
for
no
more
Can
I
demand
Mon
But
I
can
give
thee
more
For
I
will
raise
her
Statue
in
pure
gold
That
whiles
Verona
by
that
name
is
known
There
shall
no
figure
at
such
rate
be
set
As
that
of
true
and
faithful
Juliet
Cap
As
rich
shall
Romeo

his

Poor

of
our
enmity

A
glooming
peace
this
morning

The

sorrow

his

Go

to
have
more
talk
of
these
sad
things
Some
shall
be

some
punished
For
never

a
story
of
more
woe
Than
this
of

He

And

Trust

I

LORD
Thou
art

I

But

Grim

What

A

Would

FIRST
HUNTSMAN
Believe

lord
I
think

SECOND
HUNTSMAN
It
would
seem
strange
unto
him
when
he
wak
d
LORD
Even
as
a
flatt
ring
dream
or
worthless
fancy
Then
take
him
up
and
manage
well
the
jest
Carry
him
gently
to
my
fairest
chamber
And
hang
it
round
with
all
my
wanton
pictures
Balm
his
foul
head
in
warm
distilled
waters
And
burn
sweet
wood
to
make
the
lodging
sweet
Procure
me
music
ready
when
he
wakes
To
make
a
dulcet
and
a
heavenly
sound
And
if
he
chance
to
speak
be
ready
straight
And
with
a
low
submissive
reverence
Say
What
is
it
your
honour
will
command
Let
one
attend
him
with
a
silver
basin
Full
of
rose
water
and
bestrew

Another
bear

And
say
Will

your
lordship
cool
your
hands
Some
one
be
ready
with
a
costly
suit
And
ask
him
what
apparel
he
will
wear
Another
tell
him
of
his
hounds
and
horse
And
that
his
lady
mourns
at
his
disease
Persuade
him
that
he
hath
been
lunatic
And
when
he
says
he
is
say
that
he
dreams
For
he
is
nothing
but
a
mighty
lord
This

It
will

If
