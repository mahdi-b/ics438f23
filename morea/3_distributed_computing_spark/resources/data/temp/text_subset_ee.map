fold
world

should
stand
One
of
the
three
to

it
OCTAVIUS
So
you
thought
him
And
took
his
voice
who
should
be
prick
d
to
die
In
our
black
sentence
and
proscription
ANTONY
Octavius
I
have
seen
more
days
than
you
And
though
we
lay
these
honors
on
this
man
To
ease
ourselves
of
divers
slanderous
loads
He
shall
but
bear
them
as
the
ass
bears
gold
To
groan
and
sweat
under
the
business
Either
led
or
driven
as
we
point
the
way
And
having
brought
our
treasure
where
we
will
Then
take
we
down
his
load
and
turn
him
off
Like
to
the
empty
ass
to
shake
his
ears
And
graze
in
commons
OCTAVIUS
You
may
do
your
will
But
he
s
a
tried
and
valiant
soldier
ANTONY
So
is
my
horse
Octavius
and
for
that
I
do
appoint
him
store
of
provender
It
is
a
creature
that
I
teach
to
fight
To
wind
to
stop
to
run
directly
on
His
corporal
motion
govern
d
by
my
spirit
And
in
some
taste
is
Lepidus
but
so
He
must
be
taught
and
train
d
and
bid
go
forth
A
barren
spirited
fellow
one
that
feeds
On
objects
arts
and
imitations
Which
out
of
use
and
staled
by
other
men
Begin
his
fashion
Do
not
talk
of
him
But
as
a
property
And
now
Octavius
Listen
great
things
Brutus
and
Cassius
Are
levying
powers
we
must
straight
make
head
Therefore
let
our
alliance
be
combined
Our
best
friends
made
our
means
stretch

And
let
us
presently
go
sit
in
council
How
covert
matters
may
be
best
disclosed
And
open
perils
surest
answered
OCTAVIUS
Let
us
do
so
for
we
are
at
the
stake
And
bay
d
about
with
many
enemies
And
some
that
smile
have
in
their
hearts
I
fear

Stand

LUCILIUS
Give

BRUTUS
What
now
Lucilius
is
Cassius
near
LUCILIUS
He
is
at
hand
and
Pindarus
is
come
To
do
you
salutation
from
his
master
BRUTUS
He
greets
me
well
Your
master
Pindarus
In
his
own
change
or
by
ill
officers
Hath
given
me
some
worthy
cause
to
wish
Things
done
undone
but
if
he
be
at
hand
I
shall
be
satisfied
PINDARUS
I
do
not
doubt
But
that
my
noble
master
will
appear
Such
as
he
is
full
of
regard
and
honor
BRUTUS
He
is
not
doubted
A
word
Lucilius
How
he
received
you
Let
me
be
resolved
LUCILIUS
With
courtesy
and
with
respect
enough
But
not
with
such
familiar
instances
Nor
with
such
free
and
friendly
conference
As
he
hath
used
of
old
BRUTUS
Thou
hast
described
A
hot
friend
cooling
Ever
note
Lucilius
When
love
begins
to
sicken
and
decay
It
useth
an
enforced
ceremony
There
are
no
tricks
in
plain
and
simple
faith
But
hollow
men
like
horses
hot
at
hand
Make
gallant
show
and
promise
of
their
mettle
But
when
they
should
endure
the
bloody
spur
They
fall
their
crests
and
like
deceitful
jades
Sink
in
the
trial
Comes

CASSIUS
Brutus
this

And

BRUTUS
Cassius

Speak
your
griefs
softly
I
do
know
you
well
Before
the
eyes
of
both
our
armies
here
Which
should
perceive
nothing

love
from
us
Let
us
not

Bid
them

Then

Cassius

Cassius
CASSIUS
That
you

doth
appear
in

You
have
condemn
d

noted
Lucius
Pella
For
taking
bribes
here
of
the
Sardians
Wherein
my
letters
praying
on
his

Because
I
knew

slighted
off
BRUTUS
You
wrong
d
yourself
to
write
in
such
a
case
CASSIUS
In
such
a
time
as
this
it
is
not

That
every
nice
offense
should
bear
his
comment
BRUTUS
Let
me
tell
you
Cassius
you
yourself
Are
much
condemn
d
to
have
an
itching
palm
To
sell
and
mart
your
offices
for
gold
To
undeservers
CASSIUS
I
an

You
know
that
you
are
Brutus
that
speaks
this
Or
by
the
gods
this
speech
were
else
your

BRUTUS
The
name
of
Cassius
honors
this
corruption
And
chastisement
doth
therefore
hide
his
head
CASSIUS
Chastisement
BRUTUS
Remember
March
the
ides
of
March
remember
Did
not
great
Julius
bleed
for
justice
sake
What
villain
touch

his

that
did
stab
And
not
for
justice
What
shall
one
of
us
That
struck
the
foremost
man
of
all

But
for
supporting
robbers
shall
we
now
Contaminate
our
fingers
with
base
bribes
And
sell
the
mighty
space
of
our
large
honors
For
so
much
trash
as
may
be
grasped
thus
I
had
rather
be

All

Fret

Go

how
choleric

And

Must

Under

Though

When

BRUTUS
You

Let

vaunting
true
And
it

For
mine

I

CASSIUS
You
wrong

Brutus
I
said
an

Did

If

BRUTUS
For

CASSIUS
Do
not
presume
too
much
upon
my
love
I
may
do
that
I
shall
be
sorry
for
BRUTUS
You
have
done
that
you
should
be
sorry
for
There
is
no
terror
Cassius
in
your
threats
For
I
am
arm
d
so
strong
in
honesty
That
they
pass
by
me
as
the
idle
wind
Which
I
respect
not
I
did
send
to
you
For
certain
sums
of
gold
which
you
denied
me
For
I
can
raise
no
money
by
vile
means
By
heaven
I
had
rather
coin
my
heart
And
drop
my
blood
for
drachmas
than
to
wring
From
the
hard
hands
of
peasants
their
vile
trash
By
any
indirection
I
did
send
To
you
for
gold
to
pay
my
legions
Which
you
denied
me
Was
that
done
like
Cassius
Should
I
have
answer
d
Caius
Cassius
so
When
Marcus
Brutus
grows
so
covetous
To
lock
such
rascal
counters
from
his
friends
Be
ready
gods
with
all
your
thunderbolts
Dash
him
to
pieces
CASSIUS
I
denied
you
not
BRUTUS
You
did
CASSIUS
I
did
not
He
was
but
a
fool
That
brought
my
answer
back
Brutus
hath
rived
my
heart
A
friend
should
bear
his
friend
s
infirmities
But
Brutus
makes
mine
greater
than
they
are
BRUTUS
I
do
not
till
you
practise
them
on
me
CASSIUS
You
love
me
not
BRUTUS
I
do
not
like
your
faults
CASSIUS
A
friendly
eye
could
never
see
such
faults
BRUTUS
A
flatterer
s
would
not
though
they
do
appear
As
huge
as
high
Olympus
CASSIUS
Come
Antony
and
young
Octavius
come
Revenge
yourselves
alone
on
Cassius
For
Cassius
is
aweary
of
the
world
Hated
by
one
he
loves
braved
by
his
brother
Check
d
like
a
bondman
all
his
faults

Set

To
cast
into
my

O
I
could
weep
My
spirit
from
mine
eyes
There
is
my
dagger
And
here
my
naked
breast
within
a
heart
Dearer
than
Pluto
s
mine
richer
than
gold
If
that
thou
best
a
Roman
take
it
forth
I
that
denied
thee
gold
will
give
my
heart
Strike
as
thou
didst
at
Caesar
for
I
know
When
thou
didst
hate
him
worst
thou
lovedst
him
better
Than
ever
thou
lovedst
Cassius
BRUTUS
Sheathe
your
dagger
Be
angry
when
you
will
it
shall
have
scope
Do
what
you
will
dishonor
shall
be
humor
O
Cassius
you
are
yoked
with
a
lamb
That
carries
anger
as
the
flint
bears
fire
Who
much
enforced
shows
a
hasty
spark
And
straight
is
cold
again
CASSIUS
Hath
Cassius
lived
To

Brutus
When

When

rash
humor

my

Makes

forgetful
BRUTUS
Yes
Cassius

When

Impatient
of

And
grief
that
young
Octavius

Mark
Antony
Have
made

That

CASSIUS
Portia

gone
BRUTUS
No
more
I
pray
you
Messala
I
have
here
received
letters
That
young
Octavius
and
Mark
Antony
Come
down
upon
us
with
a
mighty
power
Bending
their
expedition
toward
Philippi
MESSALA
Myself
have
letters
of
the
selfsame
tenure
BRUTUS
With
what
addition
MESSALA
That
by
proscription
and
bills
of
outlawry
Octavius
Antony
and
Lepidus
Have
put
to
death
an
hundred
senators
BRUTUS
There
in
our
letters
do
not
well
agree
Mine
speak
of
seventy
senators
that
died
By
their
proscriptions
Cicero
being
one
CASSIUS
Cicero
one
MESSALA
Cicero
is
dead
And
by
that
order
of
proscription
Had
you
your
letters
from
your
wife
my
lord
BRUTUS
No
Messala
MESSALA
Nor
nothing
in
your
letters
writ
of
her
BRUTUS
Nothing
Messala
MESSALA
That
methinks
is
strange
BRUTUS
Why
ask
you
Hear
you
aught
of
her
in
yours
MESSALA
No
my
lord
BRUTUS
Now
as
you
are
a
Roman
tell
me
true
MESSALA
Then
like
a
Roman
bear
the
truth
I
tell
For
certain
she
is
dead
and
by
strange
manner
BRUTUS
Why
farewell
Portia
We
must
die
Messala
With
meditating
that
she
must
die
once
I
have
the
patience
to
endure
it
now
MESSALA
Even
so
great
men
great
losses
should
endure
CASSIUS
I
have
as
much
of
this
in
art
as
you
But
yet
my
nature
could
not
bear
it
so
BRUTUS
Well
to
our
work
alive
What
do
you
think
Of
marching
to
Philippi
presently
CASSIUS
I
do
not
think
it
good
BRUTUS
Your
reason
CASSIUS
This
it
is
Tis
better
that
the
enemy
seek
us
So
shall
he
waste
his
means
weary
his
soldiers
Doing
himself
offense
whilst
we
lying
still
Are
full
of
rest
defense
and
nimbleness
BRUTUS
Good
reasons
must
of
force
give
place
to
better
The
people
twixt
Philippi
and
this
ground
Do
stand
but
in
a
forced
affection
For
they
have
grudged
us
contribution
The
enemy
marching
along
by
them
By
them
shall
make
a
fuller
number
up
Come
on
refresh
d
new
added
and
encouraged
From
which
advantage
shall
we
cut
him
off
If
at
Philippi
we
do
face
him
there
These
people
at
our
back
CASSIUS
Hear
me
good
brother
BRUTUS
Under
your
pardon
You
must
note
beside
That
we
have
tried
the
utmost
of
our
friends
Our
legions
are
brim
full
our
cause
is
ripe
The
enemy
increaseth
every
day
We
at
the
height
are
ready
to
decline
There
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
Which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
Omitted
all
the
voyage
of
their
life
Is
bound
in
shallows
and
in
miseries
On
such
a
full
sea
are
we
now
afloat
And
we
must
take
the
current
when
it
serves
Or
lose
our

CASSIUS
No

SCENE
I
The
plains
of
Philippi
Enter
Octavius
Antony
and
their
Army
OCTAVIUS
Now
Antony
our
hopes
are
answered
You
said
the
enemy
would
not
come
down
But
keep
the
hills
and
upper
regions
It
proves
not
so
Their
battles
are
at
hand
They
mean
to
warn
us
at
Philippi
here
Answering
before
we
do
demand
of
them
ANTONY
Tut
I
am
in
their
bosoms
and
I
know
Wherefore
they
do
it
They
could
be
content
To
visit
other
places
and
come
down
With
fearful
bravery
thinking
by
this
face
To
fasten
in
our
thoughts
that
they
have
courage
But
tis
not
so
Enter
a
Messenger
MESSENGER
Prepare
you
generals
The
enemy
comes
on
in
gallant
show
Their
bloody
sign
of
battle
is
hung
out
And
something
to
be
done
immediately
ANTONY
Octavius
lead
your
battle
softly
on
Upon
the
left
hand
of
the
even
field
OCTAVIUS
Upon
the
right
hand
I
keep
thou
the
left
ANTONY
Why
do
you
cross
me
in
this
exigent
OCTAVIUS
I
do
not
cross
you
but
I
will
do
so
March
Drum
Enter
Brutus
Cassius
and
their
Army
Lucilius
Titinius
Messala
and
others
BRUTUS
They
stand
and
would
have
parley
CASSIUS
Stand
fast
Titinius
we
must
out
and
talk
OCTAVIUS
Mark
Antony
shall
we
give
sign
of
battle
ANTONY
No
Caesar
we
will
answer
on
their
charge
