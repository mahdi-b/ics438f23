Of
half
that
worth
as
those
your
swords
made
rich
With
the
most
noble
blood
of
all
this
world
I
do
beseech
ye
if
you
bear
me
hard
Now
whilst
your
purpled
hands
do
reek
and
smoke
Fulfill
your
pleasure
Live
a
thousand
years
I
shall
not
find
myself
so
apt
to
die
No
place
will
please
me
so
no
means
of
death
As
here
by
Caesar
and
by
you
cut
off
The
choice
and
master
spirits
of
this
age
BRUTUS
O
Antony
beg
not
your
death
of
us
Though
now
we
must
appear
bloody
and
cruel
As
by
our
hands
and
this
our
present
act
You
see
we
do
yet
see
you
but
our
hands
And
this
the
bleeding
business
they
have
done
Our
hearts
you
see
not
they
are
pitiful
And
pity
to
the
general
wrong
of
Rome
As
fire
drives
out
fire
so
pity
pity
Hath
done
this
deed
on
Caesar
For
your
part
To
you
our
swords
have
leaden
points
Mark
Antony
Our
arms
in
strength
of
malice
and
our
hearts
Of
brothers
temper
do
receive
you
in
With
all
kind
love
good
thoughts
and
reverence
CASSIUS
Your
voice
shall
be
as
strong
as
any
man
s
In
the
disposing
of
new
dignities
BRUTUS
Only
be
patient
till
we
have
appeased
The
multitude
beside
themselves
with
fear
And
then
we
will
deliver
you
the
cause
Why
I
that
did
love
Caesar
when
I
struck
him
Have
thus
proceeded
ANTONY
I
doubt
not
of
your
wisdom
Let
each
man
render
me
his
bloody
hand
First
Marcus
Brutus
will
I
shake
with
you
Next
Caius
Cassius
do
I
take
your
hand
Now
Decius
Brutus
yours
now
yours
Metellus
Yours
Cinna
and
my
valiant
Casca
yours
Though
last
not
least
in
love
yours
good
Trebonius
Gentlemen
all
alas
what
shall
I
say
My
credit
now
stands
on
such
slippery
ground
That
one
of
two
bad
ways
you
must
conceit
me
Either
a
coward
or
a
flatterer
That
I
did
love
thee
Caesar
O
tis
true
If
then
thy
spirit
look
upon
us
now
Shall
it
not
grieve
thee
dearer
than
thy
death
To
see
thy
Antony
making
his
peace
Shaking
the
bloody
fingers
of
thy
foes
Most
noble
In
the
presence
of
thy
corse
Had
I
as
many
eyes
as
thou
hast
wounds
Weeping
as
fast
as
they
stream
forth
thy
blood
It
would
become
me
better
than
to
close
In
terms
of
friendship
with
thine
enemies
Pardon
me
Julius
Here
wast
thou
bay
d
brave
hart
Here
didst
thou
fall
and
here
thy
hunters
stand
Sign
d
in
thy
spoil
and
crimson
d
in
thy
Lethe
O
world
thou
wast
the
forest
to
this
hart
And
this
indeed
O
world
the
heart
of
thee
How
like
a
deer
strucken
by
many
princes
Dost
thou
here
lie
CASSIUS
Mark
Antony
ANTONY
Pardon
me
Caius
Cassius
The
enemies
of
Caesar
shall
say
this
Then
in
a
friend
it
is
cold
modesty
CASSIUS
I
blame
you
not
for
praising
Caesar
so
But
what
compact
mean
you
to
have
with
us
Will
you
be
prick
d
in
number
of
our
friends
Or
shall
we
on
and
not
depend
on
you
ANTONY
Therefore
I
took
your
hands
but
was
indeed
Sway
d
from
the
point
by
looking
down
on
Caesar
Friends
am
I
with
you
all
and
love
you
all
Upon
this
hope
that
you
shall
give
me
reasons
Why
and
wherein
Caesar
was
dangerous
BRUTUS
Or
else
were
this
a
savage
spectacle
Our
reasons
are
so
full
of
good
regard
That
were
you
Antony
the
son
of
Caesar
You
should
be
satisfied
ANTONY
That
s
all
I
seek
And
am
moreover
suitor
that
I
may
Produce
his
body
to
the
marketplace
And
in
the
pulpit
as
becomes
a
friend
Speak
in
the
order
of
his
funeral
BRUTUS
You
shall
Mark
Antony
CASSIUS
Brutus
a
word
with
you
Aside
to
Brutus
You
know
not
what
you
do
Do
not
consent
That
Antony
speak
in
his
funeral
Know
you
how
much
the
people
may
be
moved
By
that
which
he
will
utter
BRUTUS
By
your
pardon
I
will
myself
into
the
pulpit
first
And
show
the
reason
of
our
Caesar
s
death
What
Antony
shall
speak
I
will
protest
He
speaks
by
leave
and
by
permission
And
that
we
are
contented
Caesar
shall
Have
all
true
rites
and
lawful
ceremonies
It
shall
advantage
more
than
do
us
wrong
CASSIUS
I
know
not
what
may
fall
I
like
it
not
BRUTUS
Mark
Antony
here
take
you
Caesar
s
body
You
shall
not
in
your
funeral
speech
blame
us
But
speak
all
good
you
can
devise
of
Caesar
And
say
you
do
t
by
our
permission
Else
shall
you
not
have
any
hand
at
all
About
his
funeral
And
you
shall
speak
In
the
same
pulpit
whereto
I
am
going
After
my
speech
is
ended
ANTONY
Be
it
so
I
do
desire
no
more
BRUTUS
Prepare
the
body
then
and
follow
us
Exeunt
all
but
Antony
ANTONY
O
pardon
me
thou
bleeding
piece
of
earth
That
I
am
meek
and
gentle
with
these
butchers
Thou
art
the
ruins
of
the
noblest
man
That
ever
lived
in
the
tide
of
times
Woe
to
the
hand
that
shed
this
costly
blood
Over
thy
wounds
now
do
I
prophesy
Which
like
dumb
mouths
do
ope
their
ruby
lips
To
beg
the
voice
and
utterance
of
my
tongue
A
curse
shall
light
upon
the
limbs
of
men
Domestic
fury
and
fierce
civil
strife
Shall
cumber
all
the
parts
of
Italy
Blood
and
destruction
shall
be
so
in
use
And
dreadful
objects
so
familiar
That
mothers
shall
but
smile
when
they
behold
Their
infants
quarter
d
with
the
hands
of
war
All
pity
choked
with
custom
of
fell
deeds
And
Caesar
s
spirit
ranging
for
revenge
With
Ate
by
his
side
come
hot
from
hell
Shall
in
these
confines
with
a
monarch
s
voice
Cry
Havoc
and
let
slip
the
dogs
of
war
That
this
foul
deed
shall
smell
above
the
earth
With
carrion
men
groaning
for
burial
Enter
a
Servant
You
serve
Octavius
Caesar
do
you
not
SERVANT
I
do
Mark
Antony
ANTONY
Caesar
did
write
for
him
to
come
to
Rome
SERVANT
He
did
receive
his
letters
and
is
coming
And
bid
me
say
to
you
by
word
of
mouth
O
Caesar
Sees
the
body
ANTONY
Thy
heart
is
big
get
thee
apart
and
weep
Passion
I
see
is
catching
for
mine
eyes
Seeing
those
beads
of
sorrow
stand
in
thine
Began
to
water
Is
thy
master
coming
SERVANT
He
lies
tonight
within
seven
leagues
of
Rome
ANTONY
Post
back
with
speed
and
tell
him
what
hath
chanced
Here
is
a
mourning
Rome
a
dangerous
Rome
No
Rome
of
safety
for
Octavius
yet
Hie
hence
and
tell
him
so
Yet
stay
awhile
Thou
shalt
not
back
till
I
have
borne
this
corse
Into
the
marketplace
There
shall
I
try
In
my
oration
how
the
people
take
The
cruel
issue
of
these
bloody
men
According
to
the
which
thou
shalt
discourse
To
young
Octavius
of
the
state
of
things
Lend
me
your

Exit

Brutus
goes

the
pulpit
THIRD
CITIZEN
The
noble
Brutus
is
ascended
Silence
BRUTUS
Be
patient
till
the
last
Romans
countrymen
and
lovers
Hear
me
for
my
cause
and
be
silent
that
you
may
hear
Believe
me
for
mine
honor
and
have
respect
to
mine
honor
that
you
may
believe
Censure
me
in
your
wisdom
and
awake
your
senses
that
you
may
the
better
judge
If
there
be
any
in
this
assembly
any
dear
friend
of
Caesar
s
to
him
I
say
that
Brutus
love
to
Caesar
was
no
less
than
his
If
then
that
friend
demand
why
Brutus
rose
against
Caesar
this
is
my
answer
Not
that
I
loved
Caesar
less
but
that
I
loved
Rome
more
Had
you
rather
Caesar
were
living
and
die
all
slaves
than
that
Caesar
were
dead
to
live
all
freemen
As
Caesar
loved
me
I
weep
for
him
as
he
was
fortunate
I
rejoice
at
it
as
he
was
valiant
I
honor
him
but
as
he
was
ambitious
I
slew
him
There
is
tears
for
his
love
joy
for
his
fortune
honor
for
his
valor
and
death
for
his
ambition
Who
is
here
so
base
that
would
be
a
bondman
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
Who
is
here
so
rude
that
would
not
be
a
Roman
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
Who
is
here
so
vile
that
will
not
love
his
country
If
any
speak
for
him
have
I
offended
I
pause
for
a
reply
ALL
None
Brutus
none
BRUTUS
Then
none
have
I
offended
I
have
done
no
more
to
Caesar
than
you
shall
do
to
Brutus
The
question
of
his
death
is
enrolled
in
the
Capitol
his
glory
not
extenuated
wherein
he
was
worthy
nor
his
offenses
enforced
for
which
he
suffered
death
Enter

Here

his
body
mourned

Mark
Antony

With

Peace

You

ALL
Peace

Let

hear

ANTONY
Friends
Romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
I
come
to
bury
Caesar
not
to
praise
him
The
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
The
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
So
let
it
be
with
Caesar
The
noble
Brutus
Hath
told
you
Caesar
was
ambitious
If
it
were
so
it
was
a
grievous
fault
And
grievously
hath
Caesar
answer
d
it
Here
under
leave
of
Brutus
and
the
rest
For
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
So
are
they
all
all
honorable
men
Come
I
to
speak
in
Caesar
s
funeral
He
was
my
friend
faithful
and
just
to
me
But
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
He
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
Rome
Whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill
Did
this
in
Caesar
seem
ambitious
When
that
the
poor
have
cried
Caesar
hath
wept
Ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
Brutus
is
an
honorable
man
You
all
did
see
that
on
the
Lupercal
I
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown
Which
he
did
thrice
refuse
Was
this
ambition
Yet
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
And
sure
he
is
an
honorable
man
I
speak
not
to
disprove
what
Brutus
spoke
But
here
I
am
to
speak
what
I
do
know
You
all
did
love
him
once
not
without
cause
What
cause
withholds
you
then
to
mourn
for
him
O
judgement
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts
And
men
have
lost
their
reason
Bear
with
me
My
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
Caesar
And
I
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me
FIRST
CITIZEN
Methinks
there
is
much
reason
in
his
sayings
SECOND
CITIZEN
If
thou
consider
rightly
of

matter
Caesar
has
had
great
wrong
THIRD

Has

I

there
will
a
worse
come
in
his
place
FOURTH
CITIZEN
Mark
d
ye
his
words
He
would
not
take
the
crown
Therefore
tis

he
was
not
ambitious

If
it
be
found
so
some

abide
it
SECOND

Poor

THIRD

There

not
a
nobler
man

than
Antony
FOURTH
CITIZEN
Now
mark
him
he
begins
again
to
speak
ANTONY
But
yesterday
the
word
of
Caesar
might
Have
stood
against
the
world
Now
lies
he
there
And
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
O
masters
If
I
were
disposed
to
stir
Your
hearts
and
minds
to
mutiny
and
rage
I
should
do
Brutus
wrong
and
Cassius
wrong
Who
you
all
know
are
honorable
men
I
will
not
do
them
wrong
I
rather
choose
To
wrong
the
dead
to
wrong
myself
and
you
Than
I
will
wrong
such
honorable
men
But
here
s
a
parchment
with
the
seal
of
Caesar
I
found
it
in
his
closet
tis
his
will
Let
but
the
commons
hear
this
testament
Which
pardon
me
I
do
not
mean
to

And
they
would
go
and
kiss
dead
Caesar
s
wounds
And
dip
their
napkins
in
his
sacred
blood
Yea
beg
a
hair
of
him
for
memory
And
dying
mention
it
within
their

Bequeathing
it
as
a
rich

Unto

ANTONY
If
you
have
tears
prepare

now
You
all
do
know
this
mantle
I
remember
The
first
time
ever
Caesar
put
it
on
Twas
on
a
summer
s
evening
in
his
tent
That
day
he
overcame
the
Nervii
Look
in
this
place
ran
Cassius
dagger
through
See
what
a
rent
the
envious
Casca
made
Through
this
the
well
beloved
Brutus
stabb
d
And
as
he
pluck
d
his
cursed
steel
away
Mark
how
the
blood
of
Caesar
follow
d
it
As
rushing
out
of
doors
to
be
resolved
If
Brutus
so
unkindly
knock
d
or
no
For
Brutus
as
you
know
was
Caesar
s
angel
Judge
O
you
gods
how
dearly
Caesar
loved
him
This
was
the
most
unkindest
cut
of
all
For
when
the
noble
Caesar
saw
him
stab
Ingratitude
more
strong
than
traitors
arms
Quite
vanquish
d
him
Then
burst
his
mighty
heart
And
in
his
mantle
muffling
up
his
face
Even
at
the
base
of
Pompey
s
statue
Which
all
the
while
ran
blood
great
Caesar
fell
O
what
a
fall
was
there
my
countrymen
Then
I
and
you
and
all
of
us
fell
down
Whilst

treason
flourish
d
over

O

weep
and

perceive
you
feel
The
dint
of
pity
These
are
gracious
drops
Kind

what
weep
you
when

Our

Good

To
such
a
sudden

They

What

griefs
they

For
I

neither

Action

To

Show
