Will

Do

haste
We

no
great
ado

friend

two
For
hark
you
Tybalt
being
slain
so
late
It
may
be
thought
we
held
him
carelessly
Being
our
kinsman
if
we
revel
much
Therefore

some
half
a
dozen
friends
And

end
But

day
Farewell
My

Light
to
my
chamber

Afore

It
is
so
very
very
late
That
we
may
call

by
Good
night
Exeunt
Scene
V
Capulet
s
orchard
Enter
Romeo
and
Juliet
aloft
at
the
Window
Jul
Wilt
thou
be
gone
It
is
not
yet
near
day
It
was
the
nightingale
and
not
the
lark
That
pierc
d
the
fearful
hollow
of
thine
ear
Nightly
she
sings
on
yond
pomegranate
tree
Believe
me
love
it
was
the
nightingale
Rom
It
was
the
lark
the
herald
of
the
morn
No
nightingale
Look
love
what
envious
streaks
Do
lace
the
severing
clouds
in
yonder
East
Night
s
candles
are
burnt
out
and
jocund
day
Stands
tiptoe
on
the
misty
mountain
tops
I
must
be
gone
and
live
or
stay
and
die
Jul
Yond
light
is
not
daylight
I
know
it
I
It
is
some
meteor
that
the
sun
exhales
To
be
to
thee
this
night
a
torchbearer
And
light
thee
on
the
way
to
Mantua
Therefore
stay
yet
thou
need
st
not
to
be
gone
Rom
Let
me
be
ta
en
let
me
be
put
to
death
I
am
content
so
thou
wilt
have
it
so
I
ll
say
yon
grey
is
not
the
morning
s
eye
Tis
but
the
pale
reflex
of
Cynthia
s
brow
Nor
that
is
not
the
lark
whose
notes
do
beat
The
vaulty
heaven
so
high
above
our
heads
I
have
more
care
to
stay
than
will
to
go
Come
death
and
welcome
Juliet
wills
it
so
How
is
t
my
soul
Let
s
talk
it
is
not
day
Jul
It
is
it
is
Hie
hence
be
gone
away
It
is
the
lark
that
sings
so
out
of
tune
Straining
harsh
discords
and
unpleasing
sharps
Some
say
the
lark
makes
sweet
division
This
doth
not
so
for
she
divideth
us
Some
say
the
lark
and
loathed
toad
chang
d
eyes
O
now
I
would
they
had
chang
d
voices
too
Since
arm
from
arm
that
voice
doth
us
affray
Hunting
thee
hence
with
hunt
s
up
to
the
day
O
now
be
gone
More
light
and
light
it
grows
Rom
More
light
and
light
more
dark
and
dark
our
woes
Enter
Nurse
Nurse
Madam
Jul
Nurse
Nurse
Your
lady
mother
is
coming
to
your
chamber
The
day
is
broke
be
wary
look
about
Jul
Then
window
let
day
in
and
let
life
out
Exit
Rom
Farewell
farewell
One
kiss
and
I
ll
descend
He
goeth
down
Jul
Art
thou
gone
so
my
lord
my
love
my
friend
I
must
hear
from
thee
every
day
in
the
hour
For
in
a
minute
there
are
many
days
O
by
this
count
I
shall
be
much
in
years
Ere
I
again
behold
my
Romeo
Rom
Farewell
I
will
omit
no
opportunity
That
may
convey
my
greetings
love
to
thee
Jul
O
think
st
thou
we
shall
ever
meet
again
Rom
I
doubt
it
not
and
all
these
woes
shall
serve
For
sweet
discourses
in
our
time
to
come
Jul
O
God
I
have
an
ill
divining
soul
Methinks
I
see
thee
now
thou
art
below
As
one
dead
in
the
bottom
of
a
tomb
Either
my
eyesight
fails
or
thou
look
st
pale
Rom
And
trust
me
love
in
my
eye
so
do
you
Dry
sorrow
drinks
our
blood
Adieu
adieu
Exit
Jul
O
Fortune
Fortune
all
men
call
thee
fickle
If
thou
art
fickle
what
dost
thou
with
him
That
is
renown
d
for
faith
Be
fickle
Fortune
For
then
I
hope
thou
wilt
not
keep
him
long
But
send
him
back
Lady
within
Ho
daughter
are
you
up
Jul
Who
is
t
that
calls
It
is
my
lady
mother
Is
she
not
down
so
late
or
up
so
early
What
unaccustom
d
cause
procures
her
hither
Enter
Mother
Lady
Why
how
now
Juliet
Jul
Madam
I
am
not
well
Lady
Evermore
weeping
for
your
cousin
s
death
What
wilt
thou
wash
him
from
his
grave
with
tears
An
if
thou
couldst
thou
couldst
not
make
him
live
Therefore
have
done
Some
grief
shows
much
of
love
But
much
of
grief
shows
still
some
want
of
wit
Jul
Yet
let
me
weep
for
such
a
feeling
loss
Lady
So
shall
you
feel
the
loss
but
not
the
friend
Which
you
weep
for
Jul
Feeling
so
the
loss
I
cannot
choose
but
ever
weep
the
friend
Lady
Well
girl
thou
weep
st
not
so
much
for
his
death
As
that
the
villain
lives
which
slaughter
d
him
Jul
What
villain
madam
Lady
That
same
villain
Romeo
Jul
aside
Villain
and
he
be
many
miles
asunder
God
pardon
him
I
do
with
all
my
heart
And
yet
no
man
like
he
doth
grieve
my
heart
Lady
That
is
because
the
traitor
murderer
lives
Jul
Ay
madam
from
the
reach
of
these
my
hands
Would
none
but
I
might
venge
my
cousin
s
death
Lady
We
will
have
vengeance
for
it
fear
thou
not
Then
weep
no
more
I
ll
send
to
one
in
Mantua
Where
that
same
banish
d
runagate
doth
live
Shall
give
him
such
an
unaccustom
d
dram
That
he
shall
soon
keep
Tybalt
company
And
then
I
hope
thou
wilt
be
satisfied
Jul
Indeed
I
never
shall
be
satisfied
With
Romeo
till
I
behold
him
dead
Is
my
poor
heart
so
for
a
kinsman
vex
d
Madam
if
you
could
find
out
but
a
man
To
bear
a
poison
I
would
temper
it
That
Romeo
should
upon
receipt
thereof
Soon
sleep
in
quiet
O
how
my
heart
abhors
To
hear
him
nam
d
and
cannot
come
to
him
To
wreak
the
love
I
bore
my
cousin
Tybalt
Upon
his
body
that
hath
slaughter
d
him
Lady
Find
thou
the
means
and
I
ll
find
such
a
man
But
now
I
ll
tell
thee
joyful
tidings
girl
Jul
And
joy
comes
well
in
such
a
needy
time
What
are
they
I
beseech
your
ladyship
Lady
Well
well
thou
hast
a
careful
father
child
One
who
to
put
thee
from
thy
heaviness
Hath
sorted
out
a
sudden
day
of
joy
That
thou
expects
not
nor
I
look
d
not
for
Jul
Madam
in
happy
time
What
day
is
that
Lady
Marry
my
child

Thursday

The
gallant
young
and
noble
gentleman
The
County
Paris
at
Saint
Peter

Church
Shall
happily
make
thee
there
a
joyful
bride
Jul
Now
by
Saint
Peter
s
Church
and
Peter
too
He
shall
not
make
me
there
a
joyful
bride
I
wonder
at
this
haste
that
I
must
wed
Ere
he
that
should
be
husband
comes
to
woo
I
pray
you
tell
my
lord
and
father
madam
I
will
not
marry
yet
and
when
I
do
I
swear
It
shall
be
Romeo
whom
you
know
I
hate
Rather
than
Paris
These
are
news
indeed
Lady
Here
comes
your
father
Tell
him
so

And

be
will
take
it
at

How

What

Evermore

In
one
little
body
Thou

st
a
bark
a
sea
a
wind
For
still
thy
eyes
which
I
may
call
the
sea
Do
ebb
and
flow
with
tears
the
bark
thy
body
is
Sailing
in
this
salt
flood
the
winds
thy
sighs
Who
raging
with
thy
tears
and
they
with
them
Without
a
sudden
calm
will
overset
Thy
tempest

Unworthy

wrought
So

Jul
Not

Proud

Delay

marriage

In

Unless

By

Comfort

all

That

Or
if
he

must
be
by

I

Beshrew

I

For

your

Your

As

Ancient

County
Paris
Friar
On
Thursday
sir
The
time
is
very
short
Par
My
father
Capulet
will
have
it
so
And
I
am
nothing
slow
to
slack
his
haste
Friar
You
say
you
do
not
know
the
lady
s
mind
Uneven
is
the
course
I
like
it
not
Par
Immoderately
she
weeps
for
Tybalt
s
death
And
therefore
have
I
little
talk
d
of
love
For
Venus
smiles
not
in
a
house
of
tears
Now
sir
her
father
counts
it
dangerous
That
she
do
give
her
sorrow
so
much
sway
And
in
his
wisdom
hastes
our
marriage
To
stop
the
inundation
of
her
tears
Which
too
much
minded
by
herself
alone
May
be
put
from
her
by
society
Now
do
you
know
the
reason
of
this
haste
Friar
aside
I
would
I
knew
not
why
it
should
be
slow

Come
you
to
make
confession
to
this
father
Jul
To
answer
that
I
should
confess
to
you
Par
Do
not
deny
to
him
that
you
love
me
Jul
I
will
confess
to
you
that
I
love
him
Par
So
will
ye
I
am
sure
that
you
love
me
Jul
If
I
do
so
it
will
be
of
more
price
Being
spoke
behind
your
back
than
to
your
face
Par
Poor
soul
thy
face
is
much
abus
d
with
tears
Jul
The
tears
have
got
small
victory
by
that
For
it
was
bad
enough
before
their
spite
Par
Thou
wrong
st
it
more
than
tears
with
that
report
Jul
That
is
no
slander
sir
which
is
a
truth
And
what
I
spake
I
spake
it
to
my
face
Par
Thy
face
is
mine
and
thou
hast
sland
red
it
Jul
It
may
be
so
for
it
is
not
mine
own
Are
you
at
leisure
holy
father
now
Or
shall
I
come
to
you
at
evening
mass
Friar
My
leisure
serves
me
pensive
daughter
now
My
lord
we
must
entreat
the
time
alone
Par
God
shield
I
should
disturb
devotion
Juliet
on
Thursday
early
will
I
rouse
ye
Till
then
adieu
and
keep
this
holy
kiss
Exit
Jul
O
shut
the
door
and
when
thou
hast
done
so
Come
weep
with
me
past
hope
past
cure
past
help
Friar
Ah
Juliet
I
already
know
thy
grief
It
strains
me
past
the
compass
of
my
wits
I
hear
thou
must
and
nothing
may
prorogue
it
On
Thursday
next
be
married
to
this
County
Jul
Tell
me
not
friar
that
thou
hear
st
of
this
Unless
thou
tell
me
how
I
may
prevent
it
If
in
thy
wisdom
thou
canst
give
no
help
Do
thou
but
call
my
resolution
wise
And
with
this
knife
I
ll
help
it
presently
God
join
d
my
heart
and
Romeo
s
thou
our
hands
And
ere
this
hand
by
thee
to
Romeo
s
seal
d
Shall
be
the
label
to
another
deed
Or
my
true
heart
with
treacherous
revolt
Turn
to
another
this
shall
slay
them
both
Therefore
out
of
thy
long
experienc
d
time
Give
me
some
present
counsel
or
behold
Twixt
my
extremes
and
me
this
bloody
knife
Shall
play
the
empire
arbitrating
that
Which
the
commission
of
thy
years
and
art
Could
to
no
issue
of
true
honour
bring
Be
not
so
long
to
speak
I
long
to
die
If
what
thou
speak
st
speak
not
of
remedy
Friar
Hold
daughter
I
do
spy
a
kind
of
hope
Which
craves
as
desperate
an
execution
As
that
is
desperate
which
we
would
prevent
If
rather
than
to
marry
County
Paris
Thou
hast
the
strength
of
will
to
slay
thyself
Then
is
it
likely
thou
wilt
undertake
A
thing
like
death
to
chide
away
this
shame
That
cop
st
with
death
himself
to
scape
from
it
And
if
thou
dar
st
I
ll
give
thee
remedy
Jul
O
bid
me
leap
rather
than
marry
Paris
From
off
the
battlements
of
yonder
tower
Or
walk
in
thievish
ways
or
bid
me
lurk
Where
serpents
are
chain
me
with
roaring
bears
Or
shut
me
nightly
in
a
charnel
house
O
ercover
d
quite
with
dead
men
s
rattling
bones
With
reeky
shanks
and
yellow
chapless
skulls
Or
bid
me
go
into
a
new
made
grave
And
hide
me
with
a
dead
man
in
his
shroud
Things
that
to
hear
them
told
have
made
me
tremble
And
I
will
do
it
without
fear
or
doubt
To
live
an
unstain
d
wife
to
my
sweet
love
Friar
Hold
then
Go
home
be
merry
give
consent
To
marry
Paris
Wednesday
is
to
morrow
To
morrow
night
look
that
thou
lie
alone
Let
not
the
nurse
lie
with
thee
in
thy
chamber
Take
thou
this
vial
being
then
in
bed
And
this
distilled
liquor
drink
thou
off
When
presently
through
all
thy
veins
shall
run
A
cold
and
drowsy
humour
for
no
pulse
Shall
keep
his
native
progress
but
surcease
No
warmth
no
breath
shall
testify
thou
livest
The
roses
in
thy
lips
and
cheeks
shall
fade
To
paly
ashes
thy
eyes
windows
fall
Like
death
when
he
shuts
up
the
day
of
life
Each
part
depriv
d
of
supple
government
Shall
stiff
and
stark
and
cold
appear
like
death
And
in
this
borrowed
likeness
of
shrunk
death
Thou
shalt
continue
two
and
forty
hours
And
then
awake
as
from
a
pleasant
sleep
Now
when
the
bridegroom
in
the
morning
comes
To
rouse
thee
from
thy
bed
there
art
thou
dead
Then
as
the
manner
of
our
country
is
In
thy
best
robes
uncovered
on
the
bier
Thou
shalt
be
borne
to
that
same
ancient
vault
Where
all
the
kindred
of
the
Capulets
lie
In
the
mean
time
against
thou
shalt
awake
Shall
Romeo
by
my
letters
know
our
drift
And
hither
shall
he
come
and
he
and
I
Will
watch
thy
waking
and
that
very
night
Shall
Romeo
bear
thee
hence
to
Mantua
And
this
shall
free
thee
from
this
present
shame
If
no
inconstant
toy
nor
womanish
fear
Abate
thy
valour
in
the
acting
it
Jul
Give
me
give
me
O
tell
not
me
of
fear
Friar
Hold
Get
you
gone
be
strong
and
prosperous
In
this
resolve
I
ll
send
a
friar
with
speed
To
Mantua
with
my
letters
to
thy
lord
Jul
Love
give
me
strength
and
strength
shall
help
afford
Farewell
