Fall
into
th
compass
of
a
praemunire
That
therefore
such
a
writ
be
sued
against
you
To
forfeit
all
your
goods
lands
tenements
Chattels
and
whatsoever
and
to
be
Out
of
the
King
s
protection
This
is
my
charge
NORFOLK
And
so
we
ll
leave
you
to
your
meditations
How
to
live
better
For
your
stubborn
answer
About
the
giving
back
the
great
seal
to
us
The
King
shall
know
it
and
no
doubt
shall
thank
you
So
fare
you
well
my
little
good
Lord
Cardinal
Exeunt
all
but
WOLSEY
WOLSEY
So
farewell
to
the
little
good
you
bear
me
Farewell
a
long
farewell
to
all
my
greatness
This
is
the
state
of
man
to
day
he
puts
forth
The
tender
leaves
of
hopes
to
morrow
blossoms
And
bears
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
The
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
And
when
he
thinks
good
easy
man
full
surely
His
greatness
is
a
ripening
nips
his
root
And
then
he
falls
as
I
do
I
have
ventur
d
Like
little
wanton
boys
that
swim
on
bladders
This
many
summers
in
a
sea
of
glory
But
far
beyond
my
depth
My
high
blown
pride
At
length
broke
under
me
and
now
has
left
me
Weary
and
old
with
service
to
the
mercy
Of
a
rude
stream
that
must
for
ever
hide
me
Vain
pomp
and
glory
of
this
world
I
hate
ye
I
feel
my
heart
new
open
d
O
how
wretched
Is
that
poor
man
that
hangs
on
princes
favours
There
is
betwixt
that
smile
we
would
aspire
to
That
sweet
aspect
of
princes
and
their
ruin
More
pangs
and
fears
than
wars
or
women
have
And
when
he
falls
he
falls
like
Lucifer
Never
to
hope
again
Enter
CROMWELL
standing
amazed
Why
how
now
Cromwell
CROMWELL
I
have
no
power
to
speak
sir
WOLSEY
What
amaz
d
At
my
misfortunes
Can
thy
spirit
wonder
A
great
man
should
decline
Nay
an
you
weep
I
am
fall
n
indeed
CROMWELL
How
does
your
Grace
WOLSEY
Why
well
Never
so
truly
happy
my
good
Cromwell
I
know
myself
now
and
I
feel
within
me
A
peace
above
all
earthly
dignities
A
still
and
quiet
conscience
The
King
has
cur
d
me
I
humbly
thank
his
Grace
and
from
these
shoulders
These
ruin
d
pillars
out
of
pity
taken
A
load
would
sink
a
navy
too
much
honour
O
tis
a
burden
Cromwell
tis
a
burden
Too
heavy
for
a
man
that
hopes
for
heaven
CROMWELL
I
am
glad
your
Grace
has
made
that
right
use
of
it
WOLSEY
I
hope
I
have
I
am
able
now
methinks
Out
of
a
fortitude
of
soul
I
feel
To
endure
more
miseries
and
greater
far
Than
my
weak
hearted
enemies
dare
offer
What
news
abroad
CROMWELL
The
heaviest
and
the
worst
Is
your
displeasure
with
the
King
WOLSEY
God
bless
him
CROMWELL
The
next
is
that
Sir
Thomas
More
is
chosen
Lord
Chancellor
in
your
place
WOLSEY
That
s
somewhat
sudden
But
he
s
a
learned
man
May
he
continue
Long
in
his
Highness
favour
and
do
justice
For
truth
s
sake
and
his
conscience
that
his
bones
When
he
has
run
his
course
and
sleeps
in
blessings
May
have
a
tomb
of
orphans
tears
wept
on
him
What
more
CROMWELL
That
Cranmer
is
return
d
with
welcome
Install
d
Lord
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
WOLSEY
That
s
news
indeed
CROMWELL
Last
that
the
Lady
Anne
Whom
the
King
hath
in
secrecy
long
married
This
day
was
view
d
in
open
as
his
queen
Going
to
chapel
and
the
voice
is
now
Only
about
her
coronation
WOLSEY
There
was
the
weight
that
pull
d
me
down
O
Cromwell
The
King
has
gone
beyond
me
All
my
glories
In
that
one
woman
I
have
lost
for
ever
No
sun
shall
ever
usher
forth
mine
honours
Or
gild
again
the
noble
troops
that
waited
Upon
my
smiles
Go
get
thee
from
me
Cromwell
I
am
a
poor
fall
n
man
unworthy
now
To
be
thy
lord
and
master
Seek
the
King
That
sun
I
pray
may
never
set
I
have
told
him
What
and
how
true
thou
art
He
will
advance
thee
Some
little
memory
of
me
will
stir
him
I
know
his
noble
nature
not
to
let
Thy
hopeful
service
perish
too
Good
Cromwell
Neglect
him
not
make
use
now
and
provide
For
thine
own
future
safety
CROMWELL
O
my
lord
Must
I
then
leave
you
Must
I
needs
forgo
So
good
so
noble
and
so
true
a
master
Bear
witness
all
that
have
not
hearts
of
iron
With
what
a
sorrow
Cromwell
leaves
his
lord
The
King
shall
have
my
service
but
my
prayers
For
ever
and
for
ever
shall
be
yours
WOLSEY
Cromwell
I
did
not
think
to
shed
a
tear
In
all
my
miseries
but
thou
hast
forc
d
me
Out
of
thy
honest
truth
to
play
the
woman
Let
s
dry
our
eyes
and
thus
far
hear
me
Cromwell
And
when
I
am
forgotten
as
I
shall
be
And
sleep
in
dull
cold
marble
where
no
mention
Of
me
more
must
be
heard
of
say
I
taught
thee
Say
Wolsey
that
once
trod
the
ways
of
glory
And
sounded
all
the
depths
and
shoals
of
honour
Found
thee
a
way
out
of
his
wreck
to
rise
in
A
sure
and
safe
one
though
thy
master
miss
d
it
Mark
but
my
fall
and
that
that
ruin
d
me
Cromwell
I
charge
thee
fling
away
ambition
By
that
sin
fell
the
angels
How
can
man
then
The
image
of
his
Maker
hope
to
win
by
it
Love
thyself
last
cherish
those
hearts
that
hate
thee
Corruption
wins
not
more
than
honesty
Still
in
thy
right
hand
carry
gentle
peace
To
silence
envious
tongues
Be
just
and
fear
not
Let
all
the
ends
thou
aim

Thy

and

Cromwell
Thou

Serve

To

The

To

A
distance
from

her
Grace
sat
down
To
rest
awhile
some
half
an
hour
or
so
In
a
rich
chair
of
state
opposing
freely
The
beauty
of
her
person
to
the
people
Believe
me

she
is
the
goodliest
woman
That
ever
lay
by
man
which
when
the
people
Had
the
full
view
of
such
a
noise
arose
As
the
shrouds
make
at
sea
in
a
stiff
tempest
As
loud
and
to
as
many
tunes
hats
cloaks
Doublets
I
think
flew
up
and
had
their
faces
Been
loose
this
day
they
had
been
lost
Such
joy
I
never
saw
before
Great
bellied
women
That
had
not
half
a
week
to
go
like
rams
In
the
old
time
of
war
would
shake
the
press
And
make

reel

No
man
living
Could

all

sorely
tainted
to
his
answer
He
fell
sick
suddenly
and
grew
so
ill
He
could
not
sit
his
mule
KATHARINE
Alas
poor
man
GRIFFITH
At
last
with
easy
roads
he
came
to
Leicester
Lodg
d
in
the
abbey
where
the
reverend
abbot
With
all
his
covent
honourably
receiv
d
him
To
whom
he
gave
these
words
O
father
Abbot
An
old
man
broken
with
the
storms
of
state
Is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
ye
Give
him
a
little
earth
for
charity
So
went
to
bed
where
eagerly
his
sickness
Pursu
d
him
still
And
three
nights
after
this
About
the
hour
of
eight
which
he
himself
Foretold
should
be
his
last
full
of
repentance
Continual
meditations
tears
and
sorrows
He
gave
his
honours
to
the
world
again
His
blessed
part
to
heaven
and
slept
in
peace
KATHARINE
So
may
he
rest
his
faults
lie
gently
on
him
Yet
thus
far
Griffith
give
me
leave
to
speak
him
And
yet
with
charity
He
was
a
man
Of
an
unbounded
stomach
ever
ranking
Himself
with
princes
one
that
by
suggestion
Tied
all
the
kingdom
Simony
was
fair
play
His
own
opinion
was
his
law
I
th
presence
He
would
say
untruths
and
be
ever
double
Both
in
his
words
and
meaning
He
was
never
But
where
he
meant
to
ruin
pitiful
His
promises
were
as
he
then
was
mighty
But
his
performance
as
he
is
now
nothing
Of
his
own
body
he
was
ill
and
gave
The
clergy
ill
example
GRIFFITH
Noble
madam
Men
s
evil
manners
live
in
brass
their
virtues
We
write
in
water
May
it
please
your
Highness
To
hear
me
speak
his
good
now
KATHARINE
Yes
good
Griffith
I
were
malicious
else
GRIFFITH
This
Cardinal
Though
from
an
humble
stock
undoubtedly
Was
fashion
d
to
much
honour
from
his
cradle
He
was
a
scholar
and
a
ripe
and
good
one
Exceeding
wise
fair
spoken
and
persuading
Lofty
and
sour
to
them
that
lov
d
him
not
But
to
those
men
that
sought
him
sweet
as
summer
And
though
he
were
unsatisfied
in
getting
Which
was
a
sin
yet
in
bestowing
madam
He
was
most
princely
ever
witness
for
him
Those
twins
of
learning
that
he
rais
d
in
you
Ipswich
and
Oxford
One
of
which
fell
with
him
Unwilling
to
outlive
the
good
that
did
it
The
other
though
unfinish
d
yet
so
famous
So
excellent
in
art
and
still
so
rising
That
Christendom
shall
ever
speak
his
virtue
His
overthrow
heap
d
happiness
upon
him
For
then
and
not
till
then
he
felt
himself
And
found
the
blessedness
of
being
little
And
to
add
greater
honours
to
his
age
Than
man
could
give
him
he
died
fearing
God
KATHARINE
After
my
death
I
wish
no
other
herald
No
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
To
keep
mine
honour
from
corruption
But
such
an
honest
chronicler
as
Griffith
Whom
I
most
hated
living
thou
hast
made
me
With
thy
religious
truth
and
modesty
Now
in
his
ashes
honour
Peace
be
with
him
patience
be
near
me
still
and
set
me
lower
I
have
not
long
to
trouble
thee
Good
Griffith
Cause
the
musicians
play
me
that
sad
note
I
nam
d
my
knell
whilst
I
sit
meditating
On
that
celestial
harmony
I
go
to
Sad
and
solemn
music
GRIFFITH
She
is
asleep
Good
wench
let
s
sit
down
quiet
For
fear
we
wake
her
Softly
gentle
Patience
THE
VISION
Enter
solemnly
tripping
one
after
another
six
PERSONAGES
clad
in
white
robes
wearing
on
their
heads
garlands
of
bays
and
golden
vizards
on
their
faces
branches
of
bays
or
palm
in
their
hands
They
first
congee
unto
her
then
dance
and
at
certain
changes
the
first
two
hold
a
spare
garland
over
her
head
at
which
the
other
four
make
reverent
curtsies
Then
the
two
that
held
the
garland
deliver
the
same
to
the
other
next
two
who
observe
the
same
order
in
their
changes
and
holding
the
garland
over
her
head
which
done
they
deliver
the
same
garland
to
the
last
two
who
likewise
observe
the
same
order
at
which
as
it
were
by
inspiration
she
makes
in
her
sleep
signs
of
rejoicing
and
holdeth
up
her
hands
to
heaven
And
so
in
their
dancing
vanish
carrying
the
garland
with
them
The
music
continues
KATHARINE
Spirits
of
peace
where
are
ye
Are
ye
all
gone
And
leave
me
here
in
wretchedness
behind
ye
GRIFFITH
Madam

are

KATHARINE
It
is
not

I
call
for
Saw

I
slept
GRIFFITH
None
madam
KATHARINE
No
Saw
you
not
even
now
a
blessed
troop
Invite
me
to
a
banquet
whose
bright
faces
Cast
thousand
beams
upon
me
like
the
sun
They
promis
d
me
eternal
happiness
And
brought
me
garlands
Griffith
which
I
feel
I
am
not
worthy
yet
to
wear
I
shall
assuredly
GRIFFITH
I
am
most
joyful
madam
such
good
dreams
Possess
your
fancy
KATHARINE
Bid
the
music

They
are
harsh
and
heavy
to
me
Music

How
much
her
Grace

the
sudden
How
long

looks
And

an
earthly
cold
Mark
her
eyes
GRIFFITH
She

GRIFFITH
You

to
blame
Knowing

will
not
lose
her
wonted
greatness
To

so
rude
behaviour
Go
to
kneel
MESSENGER

But
