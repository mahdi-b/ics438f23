Embrace

O
the
fierce
wretchedness
that

brings

Who

exempt
Since

to
misery

Who

dream

To
have

painted

Poor

Undone

Strange

blood
When

sin

too
much
good
Who

dares
to

half
so
kind
again
For
bounty

My

Rich

wretched
thy
great

Are
made

chief
afflictions
Alas

He

in

from
this
ingrateful
seat
Of
monstrous
friends
nor
has
he
with
him
to
Supply
his
life
or

which

it
I

TIMON
As

The

make
revolt
In

I

How
cursed

mindless
of
thy
worth
Forgetting
thy
great
deeds
when

But
for

TIMON
I

Why

Here
is
some
gold
for

writ
But

horrible
traitors
Spare

Whose
dimpled
smiles
from

exhaust
their
mercy
Think
it
a
bastard
whom
the
oracle
Hath
doubtfully
pronounc

thy
throat
shall
cut
And
mince
it
sans

Swear

Put

Nor

Shall

The

To

Freely

In

melted
down

In

of

and
never

d
The
icy
precepts
of

followed
The
sug
red

before

But
myself
Who
had
the

as
my
confectionary
The
mouths

of

At
duty
more
than

That
numberless
upon

stuck

Do
on

have
with
one
winter

Fell
from
their
boughs
and
left
me
open
bare
For
every
storm
that
blows
I
to
bear
this
That
never

better
is
some
burden
Thy
nature
did
commence
in

Hath
made
thee
hard

Why
shouldst
thou
hate
men
They
never
flatter
d
thee
What
hast
thou
given
If
thou
wilt
curse
thy
father
that
poor
rag
Must
be
thy
subject
who
in

put
stuff
To
some

beggar
and
compounded

Poor
rogue

Hence
be
gone
If
thou

Thou

Thus

Eating

Here

So
