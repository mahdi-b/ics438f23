KING

Thus

The

Take

From

KING

Now

To

Swearing

PANDULPH
It

my

blew
this

up
Upon
your
stubborn
usage
of

Pope
But
since
you
are
a
gentle
convertite
My
tongue
shall
hush
again
this
storm
of

And
make

On

Upon

Did
not

Say
that

Ascension
day

My

I

And
wild
amazement
hurries
up

The

KING

Would
not
my

return
to

again
After
they
heard
young
Arthur

alive
BASTARD
They
found
him
dead

cast
into

An
empty
casket

the
jewel

By

Govern

Be

Threaten

O

Forage

To
meet
displeasure
farther

My

Return

to
these

again
That
having

Both

And

albeit

A

an
unurg

To
your

yet
believe
me
Prince
I
am
not
glad
that
such
a
sore
of
time
Should
seek
a
plaster
by
contemn
d
revolt
And
heal
the
inveterate
canker
of
one
wound
By
making
many
O
it
grieves
my
soul
That
I
must
draw
this
metal
from
my

To
be
a
widow
maker
O
and
there
Where
honourable
rescue
and
defence
Cries
out
upon
the
name
of
Salisbury
But
such
is
the
infection
of
the
time
That
for
the
health
and
physic
of
our
right
We
cannot
deal
but
with
the
very
hand
Of
stern
injustice
and
confused
wrong
And
is
t
not
pity
O
my
grieved
friends
That
we
the
sons
and
children
of
this
isle
Were
born
to
see
so
sad
an
hour
as
this
Wherein
we
step
after
a
stranger
march
Upon
her
gentle
bosom
and
fill
up
Her
enemies
ranks
I
must
withdraw
and
weep
Upon
the
spot
of
this
enforced
cause
To
grace
the
gentry
of
a
land
remote
And
follow
unacquainted
colours
here
What
here
O
nation
that
thou
couldst
remove
That
Neptune
s
arms
who
clippeth
thee
about
Would
bear
thee
from
the
knowledge
of
thyself
And
grapple
thee
unto
a
pagan
shore
Where
these
two
Christian
armies
might
combine
The
blood
of
malice
in
a
vein
of
league
And
not
to
spend
it
so
unneighbourly
LEWIS
A
noble
temper
dost
thou
show
in
this
And
great
affections
wrestling
in
thy
bosom
Doth
make
an
earthquake
of
nobility
O
what
a
noble
combat
hast
thou
fought
Between
compulsion
and
a
brave
respect
Let
me
wipe
off
this
honourable
dew
That
silverly
doth
progress
on
thy
cheeks
My
heart
hath
melted
at
a
lady
s
tears
Being
an
ordinary
inundation
But
this
effusion
of
such
manly
drops
This
show
r
blown
up
by
tempest
of
the
soul
Startles
mine
eyes

makes
me
more

Figur

Lift
up

Commend
these

to
those
baby

That
never

the
giant

Nor
met
with

other
than
at

Full
of
warm

thrust
thy

Into

Look

apace

And
on

useful
serving

Your

Between

From

That

To
cudgel
you

take

To

fine
of
all
your
lives
If
Lewis
by
your
assistance
win
the
day
Commend
me
to
one
Hubert
with
your
King
The
love
of
him
and
this
respect
besides
For
that
my
grandsire
was
an
Englishman
Awakes
my
conscience
to
confess
all
this
In
lieu
whereof
I
pray
you
bear
me
hence
From
forth
the
noise
and
rumour
of
the
field
Where
I
may
think
the
remnant
of
my
thoughts
In
peace
and
part
this
body
and
my
soul
With
contemplation
and
devout
desires
SALISBURY
We
do
believe
thee
and
beshrew
my
soul
But
I
do
love
the
favour
and
the
form
Of
this
most
fair
occasion
by
the
which
We
will
untread
the
steps
of
damned
flight
And
like
a
bated
and
retired
flood
Leaving
our
rankness
and
irregular
course
Stoop
low
within
those
bounds
we
have
o
erlook
d
And
calmly
run
on
in
obedience
Even
to
our
ocean
to
great
King
John
My
arm
shall
give
thee
help
to
bear
thee
hence
For
I
do
see
the
cruel
pangs
of
death
Right
in
thine
eye
Away
my
friends
New
flight
And
happy
newness
that
intends
old
right

LEWIS
The

methought

loath

But
stay

made
the
western
welkin
blush
When
English
measure
backward
their
own
ground
In
faint
retire
O
bravely
came
we
off
When
with
a
volley
of
our
needless
shot
After
such
bloody
toil
we
bid
good
night
And
wound
our

LEWIS
Ah
foul
shrewd
news
Beshrew
thy
very
heart
I
did
not

so
sad
to

As
this
hath
made
me
Who

BASTARD
A
friend
What
art
thou
HUBERT
Of
the
part
of
England
BASTARD
Whither
dost
thou
go
HUBERT
What
s
that
to
thee
Why
may
I
not
demand
Of
thine
affairs
as
well
as
thou
of
mine
BASTARD
Hubert
I
think
HUBERT
Thou
hast
a
perfect
thought
I
will
upon
all
hazards
well
believe
Thou
art
my
friend
that
know
st
my
tongue
so
well
Who
art
thou
BASTARD
Who
thou
wilt
And
if
thou
please
Thou
mayst
befriend
me
so
much
as
to
think
I
come
one
way
of
the
Plantagenets
HUBERT
Unkind
remembrance
thou
and
eyeless
night
Have
done
me
shame
Brave
soldier
pardon
me
That
any
accent
breaking
from
thy
tongue
Should
scape
the
true
acquaintance
of
mine
ear
BASTARD
Come
come
sans
compliment
what
news

HUBERT
Why
here

I
in
the

Brief

HUBERT
O

sir
news
fitting

Black

horrible
BASTARD
Show
me
the
very
wound
of
this
ill
news
I
am
no
woman
I
ll
not
swoon
at
it
HUBERT
The
King
I
fear
is
poison
d
by
a
monk
I
left
him
almost
speechless
and
broke
out
To
acquaint
you
with
this
evil
that
you
might
The
better
arm
you
to
the
sudden
time
Than
if
you
had
at
leisure
known
of
this
BASTARD
How
did
he
take
it
who
did
taste
to
him
HUBERT
A
monk
I
tell
you
a
resolved
villain
Whose
bowels
suddenly
burst
out
The
King
Yet
speaks
and
peradventure
may
recover
BASTARD
Who
didst
thou
leave
to
tend
his
Majesty
HUBERT
Why
know
you
not
The
lords
are
all

And
brought
Prince
Henry

At

request
the
King
hath
pardon

them
And
they
are
all
about
his
Majesty
BASTARD
Withhold
thine
indignation
mighty

And
tempt

above
our
power
I

thee
Hubert
half

The
orchard

Swinstead
Abbey
Enter
PRINCE
HENRY
SALISBURY
and
BIGOT
PRINCE
HENRY
It
is
too
late
the
life
of
all
his
blood
Is
touch
d
corruptibly
and
his
pure
brain
Which
some
suppose
the
soul
s
frail
dwelling
house
Doth
by
the
idle
comments
that
it
makes
Foretell
the
ending
of
mortality
Enter
PEMBROKE
PEMBROKE
His
Highness
yet
doth
speak
and
holds
belief
That
being
brought
into
the
open
air
It
would
allay
the
burning
quality
Of
that
fell
poison
which
assaileth
him
PRINCE
HENRY
Let
him
be
brought
into
the
orchard
here
Doth
he
still
rage
Exit
BIGOT
PEMBROKE
He
is
more
patient
Than
when
you
left
him
even
now
he
sung
PRINCE
HENRY
O
vanity
of
sickness
Fierce
extremes
In
their
continuance
will
not
feel
themselves
Death
having
prey
d
upon
the
outward
parts
Leaves
them
invisible
and
his
siege
is
now
Against
the
mind
the
which
he
pricks
and
wounds
With
many
legions
of
strange
fantasies
Which
in
their
throng
and
press
to
that
last
hold
Confound
themselves
Tis
strange
that
death
should
sing
I
am
the
cygnet
to
this
pale
faint
swan
Who
chants
a
doleful
hymn
to
his
own
death
And
from
the
organ
pipe
of
frailty
sings
His
soul
and
body
to
their
lasting
rest
SALISBURY
Be
of
good
comfort
Prince
for
you
are
born
To
set
a
form
upon
that
indigest
Which
he
hath
left
so
shapeless

so
rude

KING
JOHN
Ay
marry
now
my
soul
hath
elbow
room
It
would
not
out
at
windows
nor
at
doors
There
is
so
hot
a
summer
in
my
bosom
That
all
my
bowels
crumble
up
to
dust
I
am
a
scribbled
form
drawn
with
a
pen
Upon
a
parchment
and
against
this
fire
Do
I
shrink
up
PRINCE
HENRY
How
fares
your
Majesty
KING
JOHN
Poison
d
ill
fare
Dead
forsook
cast
off
And
none
of
you
will
bid
the
winter
come
To
thrust
his
icy
fingers
in
my
maw
Nor
let
my
kingdom
s
rivers
take
their
course
Through
my
burn
d
bosom
nor
entreat
the
north
To
make
his
bleak
winds
kiss
my
parched
lips
And
comfort
me
with
cold
I
do
not
ask
you
much
I
beg
cold
comfort
and
you
are
so
strait
And
so
ingrateful
you
deny
me
that
PRINCE
HENRY
O
that
there
were
some
virtue
in
my
tears
That
might
relieve
you
KING
JOHN
The
salt
in
them
is
hot
Within
me
is
a
hell
and
there
the
poison
Is
as
a
fiend
confin

to
tyrannize
