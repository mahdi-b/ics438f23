Wherein
of
antres
vast
and
deserts
idle
Rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
It
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
And
of
the
Cannibals
that
each
other
eat
The
Anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
Do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
This
to
hear
Would
Desdemona
seriously
incline
But
still
the
house
affairs
would
draw
her
thence
Which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
She
ld
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
Devour
up
my
discourse
which
I
observing
Took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
To
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
That
I
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
Whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
But
not
intentively
I
did
consent
And
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
When
I
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
That
my
youth
suffer
d
My
story
being
done
She
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
She
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
Twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
She
wish
d
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wish
d
That
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thank
d
me
And
bade
me
if
I
had
a
friend
that
loved
her
I
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
And
that
would
woo
her
Upon
this
hint
I
spake
She
loved
me
for
the
dangers
I
had
pass
d
And
I
loved
her
that
she
did
pity
them
This
only
is
the
witchcraft
I
have
used
Here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
Enter
Desdemona
Iago
and
Attendants
DUKE
I
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
Good
Brabantio
Take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
Men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
Than
their
bare
hands
BRABANTIO
I
pray
you
hear
her
speak
If
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
Destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
Light
on
the
man
Come
hither
gentle
mistress
Do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
Where
most
you
owe
obedience
DESDEMONA
My
noble
father
I
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
To
you
I
am
bound
for
life
and
education
My
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
How
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
I
am
hitherto
your
daughter
But
here
s
my
husband
And
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
show
d
To
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
So
much
I
challenge
that
I
may
profess
Due
to
the
Moor
my
lord
BRABANTIO
God
be
with
you
I
have
done
Please
it
your
Grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
I
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
Come
hither
Moor
I
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
Which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
I
would
keep
from
thee
For
your
sake
jewel
I
am
glad
at
soul
I
have
no
other
child
For
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
To
hang
clogs
on
them
I
have
done
my
lord
DUKE
Let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
Which
as
a
grise
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
Into
your
favor
When
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
By
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
To
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
Is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
What
cannot
be
preserved
when
Fortune
takes
Patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
The
robb
d
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
He
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
BRABANTIO
So
let
the
Turk
of
Cyprus
us
beguile
We
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
He
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
But
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
But
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
That
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
These
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
Being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
But
words
are
words
I
never
yet
did
hear
That
the
bruised
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
I
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
DUKE
The
Turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
Cyprus
Othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
You
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
OTHELLO
The
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
Hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
My
thrice
driven
bed
of
down
I
do
agnize
A
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
I
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
These
present
wars
against
the
Ottomites
Most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
I
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
Due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
With
such
accommodation
and
besort
As
levels
with
her
breeding
DUKE
If
you
please
Be
t
at
her
father
s
BRABANTIO
I
ll
not
have
it
so
OTHELLO
Nor
I
DESDEMONA
Nor
I
I
would
not
there
reside
To
put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
By
being
in
his
eye
Most
gracious
Duke
To
my
unfolding
lend
your
prosperous
ear
And
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
To
assist
my
simpleness
DUKE
What
would
you
Desdemona
DESDEMONA
That
I
did
love
the
Moor
to
live
with
him
My
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
May
trumpet
to
the
world
My
heart
s
subdued
Even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
I
saw
Othello
s
visage
in
his
mind
And
to
his
honors
and
his
valiant
parts
Did
I
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
So
that
dear
lords
if
I
be
left
behind
A
moth
of
peace
and
he
go
to
the
war
The
rites
for
which
I
love
him
are
bereft
me
And
I
a
heavy
interim
shall
support
By
his
dear
absence
Let
me
go
with
him
OTHELLO
Let
her
have
your
voices
Vouch
with
me
heaven
I
therefore
beg
it
not
To
please
the
palate
of
my
appetite
Nor
to
comply
with
heat
the
young
affects
In
me
defunct
and
proper
satisfaction
But
to
be
free
and
bounteous
to
her
mind
And
heaven
defend
your
good
souls
that
you
think
I
will
your
serious
and
great
business
scant
For
she
is
with
me
No
when
light
wing
d
toys
Of
feather
d
Cupid
seel
with
wanton
dullness
My
speculative
and
officed
instruments
That
my
disports
corrupt
and
taint
my
business
Let
housewives
make
a
skillet
of
my
helm
And
all
indign
and
base
adversities
Make
head
against
my
estimation
DUKE
Be
it
as
you
shall
privately
determine
Either
for
her
stay
or
going
The
affair
cries
haste
And
speed
must
answer
t
you
must
hence

DESDEMONA
Tonight
my
lord
DUKE
This
night
OTHELLO
With
all
my
heart
DUKE
At
nine
i
the
morning
here
we
ll
meet
again
Othello
leave
some
officer
behind
And
he
shall
our
commission
bring
to
you
With
such
things

of
quality
and
respect
As
doth
import
you
OTHELLO
So
please
your
Grace

ancient
A
man

is
of
honesty
and
trust
To
his
conveyance
I
assign
my
wife
With

good
Grace

To

Let
it

Good
night

To

FIRST
SENATOR
Adieu
brave
Moor
use
Desdemona
well
BRABANTIO
Look
to
her
Moor
if
thou
hast
eyes
to
see
She
has
deceived
her
father
and
may
thee
Exeunt
Duke
Senators
and
Officers
OTHELLO
My
life
upon
her
faith
Honest
Iago
My
Desdemona
must
I
leave
to
thee
I
prithee
let
thy
wife
attend
on
her
And
bring
them
after
in
the
best
advantage
Come
Desdemona
I
have
but
an
hour
Of
love
of
worldly
matters
and
direction
To
spend
with
thee
We
must
obey
the
time
Exeunt
Othello
and
Desdemona
RODERIGO
Iago
IAGO
What
say
st
thou
noble
heart
RODERIGO
What
will
I
do
thinkest
thou
IAGO
Why
go
to
bed
and
sleep
RODERIGO
I
will
incontinently
drown
myself
IAGO
If
thou
dost
I
shall
never
love
thee
after
Why
thou
silly
gentleman
RODERIGO
It
is
silliness
to
live
when
to
live
is
torment
and
then
have
we
a
prescription
to
die
when
death
is
our
physician
IAGO
O
villainous
I
have
looked
upon
the
world
for
four
times
seven
years
and
since
I
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
injury
I
never
found
man
that
knew
how
to
love
himself
Ere
I
would
say
I
would
drown
myself
for
the
love
of
a
guinea
hen
I
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboon
RODERIGO
What
should
I
do
I
confess
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
virtue
to
amend
it
IAGO
Virtue
a
fig
Tis
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
Our
bodies
are
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardeners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettles
or
sow
lettuce
set
hyssop
and
weed
up
thyme
supply
it
with
one
gender
of
herbs
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
have
it
sterile
with
idleness
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigible
authority
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
If
the
balance
of
our
lives
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poise
another
of
sensuality
the
blood
and
baseness
of
our
natures
would
conduct
us
to
most
preposterous
conclusions
But
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
I
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
RODERIGO
It
cannot
be
IAGO
It
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
Come
be
a
man
Drown
thyself
Drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
I
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
I
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
I
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
Put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
thou
the
wars
defeat
thy
favor
with
an
usurped
beard
I
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
It
cannot
be
that
Desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
Moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
It
was
a
violent
commencement
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
These
Moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
The
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
acerb
as
the
coloquintida
She
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
She
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
If
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
Make
all
the
money
thou
canst
If
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
Venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
A
pox
of
drowning
thyself
It
is
clean
out
of
the
way
Seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
RODERIGO
Wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
I
depend
on
the
issue
IAGO
Thou
art
sure
of
me
go
make
money
I
have
told
thee
often
and
I
retell
thee
again
and
again
I
hate
the
Moor
My
cause
is
hearted
thine
hath
no
less
reason
Let
us
be
conjunctive
in
our
revenge
against
him
If
thou
canst
cuckold
him
thou
dost
thyself
a
pleasure
me
a
sport
There
are
many
events
in
the
womb
of
time
which
will
be
delivered
Traverse
go
provide
thy
money
We
will
have
more
of
this
tomorrow
Adieu
RODERIGO
Where
shall
we
meet
i
the
morning
IAGO
At
my
lodging
RODERIGO
I
ll
be
with
thee
betimes
IAGO
Go
to
farewell
Do
you
hear
Roderigo
RODERIGO
What
say
you
IAGO
No
more
of
drowning
do
you
hear
RODERIGO
I
am
changed
I
ll
go
sell
all
my
land
Exit
IAGO
Thus
do
I
ever
make
my
fool
my
purse
For
I
mine
own
gain
d
knowledge
should
profane
If
I
would
time
expend
with
such
a
snipe
But
for
my
sport
and
profit
I
hate
the
Moor
And
it
is
thought
abroad
that
twixt
my
sheets
He
has
done
my
office
I
know
not
if
t
be
true
But
I
for
mere
suspicion
in
that
kind
Will
do
as
if
for
surety
He
holds
me
well
The
better
shall
my
purpose
work
on
him
Cassio
s
a
proper
man
Let
me
see
now
To
get
his
place
and
to
plume
up
my
will
In
double
knavery
How
how
Let
s
see
After
some
time
to
abuse
Othello
s
ear
That
he
is
too
familiar
with
his
wife
He
hath
a
person
and
a
smooth
dispose
To
be
suspected
framed
to
make
women
false
The
Moor
is
of
a
free
and
open
nature
That
thinks
men
honest
that
but
seem
to
be
so
And
will
as
tenderly

by
the
nose
As
asses

Must

SCENE
I
A
seaport
in
Cyprus
An
open
place
near
the
quay
Enter
Montano
and
two
Gentlemen
MONTANO
What
from
the
cape
can
you
discern
at
sea
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
Nothing
at
all
It
is
a
high
wrought
flood
I
cannot
twixt
the
heaven
and
the
main
Descry
a
sail
MONTANO
Methinks
the
wind
hath
spoke
aloud
at
land
A
fuller
blast
ne
er
shook
our
battlements
If
it
hath
ruffian
d
so
upon
the
sea
What
ribs
of
oak
when
mountains
melt
on
them
Can
hold
the
mortise
What
shall
we
hear
of
this
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
A
segregation
of
the
Turkish
fleet
For
do
but
stand
upon
the
foaming
shore
The
chidden
billow
seems
to
pelt
the
clouds
The
wind
shaked
surge
with
high
and
monstrous
mane
Seems
to
cast
water
on
the
burning
bear
And
quench
the
guards
of
the
ever
fixed
pole
I
never
did
like
molestation
view
On
the
enchafed
flood
MONTANO
If

Turkish
fleet
Be

Gentleman
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
News
lads
Our
wars
are
done
The
desperate
tempest
hath
so
bang
d
the
Turks
That
their
designment
halts
A
noble
ship
of
Venice
Hath
seen
a
grievous
wreck
and
sufferance
On
most
part
of
their
fleet
MONTANO
How
Is
this
true
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
The
ship

A
Veronesa
Michael
Cassio
Lieutenant
to
the
warlike
Moor
Othello
Is

Moor

And

in
full
commission
here
for
Cyprus
MONTANO
I
am
glad

a
worthy
governor
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
But
this
same
Cassio
though
he
speak
of
comfort
Touching
the
Turkish
loss
yet
he
looks
sadly
And
prays
the
Moor
be
safe
for
they
were
parted
With
foul
and
violent
tempest
MONTANO
Pray
heavens
he
be
For
I
have
served
him
and
the
man
commands
Like
a
full
soldier
Let

As
well
to
see
the
vessel
that

come
in
As
to
throw
out
our
eyes
for
brave
Othello
Even
till
we

An
indistinct

THIRD

Come

For

Of

CASSIO
Thanks
you
the
valiant

this
warlike
isle
That
so
approve
the
Moor
O
let
the
heavens
Give
him
defense
against
the
elements
For
I
have
lost
him
on
a
dangerous
sea
MONTANO

d
CASSIO
His
bark
is
stoutly
timber
d
and
his
pilot
Of
very
expert
and
approved
allowance
Therefore
my
hopes
not
surfeited
to
death
Stand
in
bold
cure
A
cry

A
sail

Enter

Gentleman
What

FOURTH
GENTLEMAN
The
town
is
empty

the
brow
o
the

Stand
ranks
of
people
and
they
cry
A

CASSIO
My
hopes
do
shape
him
for
the
governor
Guns

SECOND
GENTLEMAN
They
do
discharge
their
shot
of
courtesy
Our
friends

least
CASSIO

And

truth
who

arrived
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
I
shall
Exit
MONTANO
But
good
lieutenant
is
your
general
wived
CASSIO
Most
fortunately
he
hath
achieved
a
maid
That
paragons
description
and
wild
fame
One
that
excels
the
quirks
of
blazoning
pens
And
in
the
essential
vesture
of
creation
Does
tire
the
ingener
Re

Gentleman
How

SECOND
GENTLEMAN
Tis
one
Iago
ancient
to
the
general
CASSIO
He
has
had
most
favorable
and
happy
speed
Tempests
themselves
high
seas
and
howling
winds
The
gutter
d
rocks
and
congregated
sands
Traitors
ensteep
d
to
clog
the
guiltless
keel
As
having
sense
of
beauty
do
omit
Their
mortal
natures
letting
go

The
divine
Desdemona

What
is
she
CASSIO
She

I
spake
of
our
great
captain

Left

Whose

thoughts
A

Great
Jove
Othello
guard
And
swell
his
sail
with
thine

powerful
breath
That

his
tall

Make

Attendants
O

The

Ye

your

Hall
to
thee

And

Before

Enwheel
thee

DESDEMONA
I
thank
you
valiant
Cassio
What
tidings
can
you
tell
me
of
my
lord
CASSIO
He
is
not
yet
arrived
nor
know
I
aught
But
that
he
s
well
and
will
be
shortly
here
DESDEMONA
O
but
I
fear
How
lost
you
company
CASSIO
The
great
contention
of
the
sea
and
skies
Parted
our
fellowship
But
hark
a
sail
A
cry
within
A
sail
a
sail
Guns
heard
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
They
give
their
greeting
to
the
citadel
This
likewise
is
a
friend
CASSIO
See
for
the
news
Exit
Gentleman
Good
ancient
you
are
welcome
To
Emilia
Welcome
mistress
Let
it
not
gall
your
patience
good
Iago
That
I
extend
my
manners
tis
my
breeding
That
gives
me
this
bold
show
of
courtesy
Kisses
her
IAGO
Sir
would
she
give
you
so
much
of
her
lips
As
of
her
tongue
she
oft
bestows
on
me
You
ld
have
enough
DESDEMONA
Alas
she
has
no
speech
IAGO
In
faith
too
much
I
find
it
still
when
I
have
list
to
sleep
Marry
before
your
ladyship
I
grant
She
puts
her
tongue
a
little
in
her
heart
And
chides
with
thinking
EMILIA
You
have
little
cause
to
say
so
IAGO
Come
on
come
on
You
are
pictures
out
of
doors
Bells
in
your
parlors
wildcats
in
your
kitchens
Saints
in
your
injuries
devils
being
offended
Players
in
your
housewifery
and
housewives
in
your
beds
DESDEMONA
O
fie
upon
thee
slanderer
IAGO
Nay
it
is
true
or
else
I
am
a
Turk
You
rise
to
play
and
go
to
bed
to
work
EMILIA
You
shall
not
write
my
praise
IAGO
No
let
me
not
DESDEMONA
What
wouldst
thou
write
of
me
if
thou
shouldst
praise
me
IAGO
O
gentle
lady
do
not
put
me
to
t
For
I
am
nothing
if
not
critical
DESDEMONA
Come
on
assay
There
s
one
gone
to
the
harbor
IAGO
Ay
madam
DESDEMONA
I
am
not
merry
but
I
do
beguile
The
thing
I
am
by
seeming
otherwise
Come
how
wouldst
thou
praise
me
IAGO
I
am
about
it
but
indeed
my
invention
Comes
from
my
pate
as
birdlime
does
from
frieze
It
plucks
out
brains
and
all
But
my
Muse
labors
And
thus
she
is
deliver
d
If
she
be
fair
and
wise
fairness
and
wit
The
one
s
for
use
the
other
useth
it
DESDEMONA
Well
praised
How
if
she
be
black
and
witty
IAGO
If
she
be
black
and
thereto
have
a
wit
She
ll
find
a
white
that
shall
her
blackness
fit
DESDEMONA
Worse
and
worse
EMILIA
How
if
fair
and
foolish
IAGO
She
never
yet
was
foolish
that
was
fair
For
even
her
folly
help
d
her
to
an
heir
DESDEMONA
These
are
old
fond
paradoxes
to
make
fools
laugh
i
the
alehouse
What
miserable
praise
hast
thou
for
her
that
s
foul
and
foolish
IAGO
There
s
none
so
foul
and
foolish
thereunto
But
does
foul
pranks
which
fair
and
wise
ones
do
DESDEMONA
O
heavy
ignorance
Thou
praisest
the
worst
best
But
what
praise
couldst
thou
bestow
on
a
deserving
woman
indeed
one
that
in
the
authority
of
her
merit
did
justly
put
on
the
vouch
of
very
malice
itself
IAGO
She
that
was
ever
fair
and
never
proud
Had
tongue
at
will
and
yet
was
never
loud
Never
lack
d
gold
and
yet
went
never
gay
Fled
from
her
wish
and
yet
said
Now
I
may
She
that
being
anger
d
her
revenge
being
nigh
Bade
her
wrong
stay
and
her
displeasure
fly
She
that
in
wisdom
never
was
so
frail
To
change
the
cod
s
head
for
the
salmon
s
tail
She
that
could
think
and
ne
er
disclose
her
mind
See
suitors
following
and
not
look
behind
She
was
a
wight
if
ever
such
wight
were
DESDEMONA
To
do
what
IAGO
To
suckle
fools
and
chronicle
small
beer
DESDEMONA
O
most
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
Do
not
learn
of
him
Emilia
though
he
be
thy
husband
How
say
you
Cassio
Is
he
not
a
most
profane
and
liberal
counselor
CASSIO
He
speaks
home
madam
You
may
relish
him
more
in
the
soldier
than
in
the
scholar
IAGO
Aside
He
takes
her
by
the
palm
ay
well
said
whisper
With
as
little
a
web
as
this
will
I
ensnare
as
great
a
fly
as
Cassio
Ay
smile
upon
her
do
I
will
gyve
thee
in
thine
own
courtship
You
say
true
tis
so
indeed
If
such
tricks
as
these
strip
you
out
of
your
lieutenantry
it
had
been
better
you
had
not
kissed
your
three
fingers
so
oft
which
now
again
you
are
most
apt
to
play
the
sir
in
Very
good
Well
kissed
an
excellent
courtesy
tis
so
indeed
Yet
again
your
fingers
to
your
lips
Would
they
were
clyster
pipes
for
your
sake
Trumpet
within
The
Moor
I
know
his
trumpet
CASSIO
Tis
truly
so
DESDEMONA
Let
s
meet
him
and
receive
him
CASSIO
Lo
where
he
comes
Enter
Othello
and
Attendants
OTHELLO
O
my
fair
warrior
DESDEMONA
My
dear
Othello
OTHELLO
It
gives
me
wonder
great
as
my
content
To
see
you
here
before
me
O
my
soul
s
joy
If
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
May
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
waken
d
death
And
let
the
laboring
bark
climb
hills
of
seas
Olympus
high
and
duck
again
as
low
As
hell
s
from
heaven
If
it
were
now
to
die
Twere
now
to
be
most
happy
for
I
fear
My
soul
hath
her
content
so
absolute
That
not
another
comfort
like
to
this
Succeeds
in
unknown
fate
DESDEMONA
The
heavens
forbid
But
that
our
loves
and
comforts
should
increase
Even
as
our
days
do
grow
OTHELLO
Amen
to
that
sweet
powers
I
cannot
speak
enough
of
this
content
It
stops
me
here
it
is
too
much
of
joy
And
this
and
this
the
greatest
discords
be
Kisses
her
That
e
er
our
hearts
shall
make
IAGO
Aside
O
you
are
well
tuned
now
But
I
ll
set
down
the
pegs
that
make
this
music
As
honest
as
I
am
OTHELLO
Come
