Of
the
most
pious
Edward
with
such
grace
That
the
malevolence
of
fortune
nothing
Takes
from
his
high
respect
Thither
Macduff
Is
gone
to
pray
the
holy
King
upon
his
aid
To
wake
Northumberland
and
warlike
Siward
That
by
the
help
of
these
with
Him
above
To
ratify
the
work
we
may
again
Give
to
our
tables
meat
sleep
to
our
nights
Free
from
our
feasts
and
banquets
bloody
knives
Do
faithful
homage
and
receive
free
honors
All
which
we
pine
for
now
And
this
report
Hath
so
exasperate
the
King
that
he
Prepares
for
some
attempt
of
war

Sir

The

turns
me
his
back
And
hums
as
who
should
say
You

rue
the
time
That
clogs
me
with
this
answer
LENNOX
And
that
well
might
Advise
him
to
a
caution
to
hold
what
distance
His
wisdom
can
provide
Some
holy
angel
Fly
to
the
court
of
England
and
unfold
His
message
ere
he
come
that
a
swift
blessing
May
soon
return
to
this
our
suffering
country
Under
a
hand
accursed
LORD
I
ll
send
my
prayers
with

LADY
MACDUFF

had
he
done
to
make
him
fly

land
ROSS
You
must
have
patience
madam
LADY
MACDUFF
He
had
none
His
flight
was
madness
When
our
actions
do
not
Our
fears
do
make
us
traitors
ROSS
You
know
not
Whether
it
was
his
wisdom
or
his
fear
LADY
MACDUFF
Wisdom
To
leave
his
wife
to
leave
his
babes
His
mansion
and
his
titles
in
a
place
From
whence
himself
does
fly
He
loves
us
not
He
wants
the
natural
touch
for
the
poor
wren
The
most
diminutive
of
birds
will
fight
Her
young
ones
in
her
nest
against
the
owl
All
is
the
fear
and
nothing
is
the
love
As
little
is
the
wisdom
where
the
flight
So
runs
against
all
reason
ROSS
My
dearest
coz
I
pray
you
school
yourself
But
for
your
husband
He
is
noble
wise
Judicious
and
best
knows
The
fits
o
the
season
I
dare
not
speak
much
further
But
cruel
are
the
times
when
we
are
traitors
And
do
not
know
ourselves
when
we
hold
rumor
From
what
we
fear
yet
know
not
what
we
fear
But
float
upon
a
wild
and
violent
sea
Each
way
and
move
I
take
my
leave
of
you
Shall
not
be
long

I

where
to

Is
often
laudable
to

sometime
Accounted
dangerous
folly
Why

Malcolm
and
Macduff
MALCOLM
Let
us
seek
out
some
desolate
shade
and
there
Weep
our
sad
bosoms
empty
MACDUFF
Let
us
rather
Hold
fast
the
mortal
sword
and
like
good
men
Bestride
our
downfall
n
birthdom
Each
new
morn
New
widows
howl
new

new
sorrows
Strike
heaven
on
the
face
that
it
resounds
As
if
it

with
Scotland
and

d
out
Like
syllable
of

What

As
I

may
be
so
perchance
This
tyrant
whose
sole
name
blisters
our
tongues
Was
once
thought
honest
You
have
loved
him
well
He
hath
not
touch
d
you
yet
I
am
young
but
something
You
may
deserve
of
him
through
me
and
wisdom
To
offer
up
a
weak
poor
innocent
lamb
To
appease
an
angry
god
MACDUFF
I
am
not
treacherous
MALCOLM
But
Macbeth

A
good
and
virtuous
nature
may
recoil
In
an
imperial
charge
But
I
shall
crave
your
pardon
That
which
you
are
my
thoughts
cannot
transpose
Angels
are
bright
still
though
the
brightest
fell
Though
all
things
foul
would
wear
the
brows
of
grace
Yet
grace
must
still
look
so
MACDUFF
I
have
lost
my
hopes
MALCOLM
Perchance
even
there
where
I
did
find
my
doubts
Why
in
that
rawness
left
you
wife
and
child
Those
precious
motives
those
strong
knots
of
love
Without
leave
taking
I
pray
you
Let
not
my
jealousies
be
your
dishonors
But
mine
own
safeties
You
may
be
rightly
just
Whatever
I
shall
think

Fare
thee
well
lord
I
would
not
be
the
villain
that
thou
think
st
For
the
whole
space
that
s
in
the
tyrant
s
grasp
And
the
rich
East
to
boot
MALCOLM
Be
not
offended
I
speak
not
as
in
absolute
fear
of
you
I
think
our
country
sinks
beneath
the
yoke
It
weeps
it
bleeds
and
each
new
day
a
gash
Is
added
to
her
wounds
I
think
withal
There
would
be
hands
uplifted
in
my
right
And
here
from
gracious
England
have
I
offer
Of
goodly
thousands
But
for
all
this
When
I
shall
tread
upon
the
tyrant
s
head
Or
wear
it
on
my
sword
yet
my
poor
country
Shall
have
more
vices
than
it
had
before
More
suffer
and
more
sundry
ways
than
ever
By
him
that
shall
succeed
MACDUFF
What
should
he
be
MALCOLM
It
is
myself
I
mean
in
whom
I
know
All
the
particulars
of
vice
so
grafted
That
when
they
shall
be
open
d
black
Macbeth
Will
seem
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
poor
state
Esteem
him
as
a
lamb
being
compared
With
my
confineless
harms

Not
in
the
legions
Of
horrid
hell

In
evils
to
top
Macbeth
MALCOLM
I
grant
him
bloody
Luxurious
avaricious
false
deceitful
Sudden
malicious
smacking
of
every
sin
That
has
a
name
But
there
s
no
bottom
none
In
my
voluptuousness
Your
wives
your
daughters
Your
matrons
and
your
maids
could
not
fill
up
The
cestern
of
my
lust
and
my
desire
All
continent
impediments
would
o
erbear
That
did
oppose
my
will
Better
Macbeth
Than
such
an
one
to
reign
MACDUFF
Boundless
intemperance
In
nature
is
a
tyranny
it
hath
been
The
untimely
emptying
of
the
happy
throne
And
fall
of
many
kings
But
fear
not
yet
To
take
upon
you
what
is
yours
You
may
Convey
your
pleasures
in
a
spacious
plenty
And
yet
seem
cold
the
time
you
may
so
hoodwink
We
have
willing
dames
enough
there
cannot
be
That
vulture
in
you
to
devour
so
many
As
will
to
greatness
dedicate
themselves
Finding
it
so
inclined
MALCOLM
With
this
there
grows
In
my
most
ill
composed
affection
such
A
stanchless
avarice
that
were
I
King
I
should
cut
off
the
nobles
for
their
lands
Desire
his
jewels
and
this
other
s
house
And
my
more
having
would
be
as
a
sauce
To
make
me
hunger
more
that
I
should
forge
Quarrels
unjust
against
the
good
and
loyal
Destroying
them
for
wealth
MACDUFF
This
avarice
Sticks
deeper
grows
with
more
pernicious
root
Than
summer
seeming
lust
and
it
hath
been
The
sword
of
our
slain
kings
Yet
do
not
fear
Scotland
hath
foisons
to
fill
up
your
will
Of
your
mere
own
All
these
are
portable
With
other
graces

MALCOLM
But
I
have
none
The
king
becoming
graces
As
justice
verity
temperance
stableness
Bounty
perseverance
mercy
lowliness
Devotion
patience
courage
fortitude
I
have
no
relish
of
them
but
abound
In
the
division
of
each
several
crime
Acting
it
many
ways
Nay
had
I
power
I
should
Pour
the
sweet
milk
of
concord
into
hell
Uproar
the
universal
peace
confound
All
unity
on
earth
MACDUFF
O
Scotland
Scotland
MALCOLM
If
such
a
one
be
fit
to
govern

I
am
as
I
have
spoken
MACDUFF
Fit

No
not

When
shalt
thou
see
thy
wholesome
days
again
Since
that
the
truest
issue
of
thy
throne
By
his
own
interdiction
stands
accursed
And
does
blaspheme
his
breed
Thy
royal
father
Was
a
most
sainted
king
the
queen
that
bore
thee
Oftener
upon
her
knees
than
on
her
feet
Died
every
day
she
lived
Fare
thee
well
These
evils

d
me
from
Scotland
O
my
breast
Thy
hope
ends
here
MALCOLM
Macduff
this
noble
passion
Child
of
integrity
hath
from
my
soul
Wiped
the
black
scruples
reconciled
my
thoughts
To
thy
good
truth
and
honor
Devilish
Macbeth
By
many
of
these
trains
hath
sought
to
win
me
Into
his
power
and
modest
wisdom
plucks
me
From
over
credulous
haste
But
God
above
Deal
between
thee
and
me
For
even
now
I
put
myself
to
thy
direction
and
Unspeak
mine
own
detraction
here
abjure
The
taints
and
blames
I
laid
upon
myself
For
strangers
to
my
nature
I
am
yet
Unknown
to
woman
never
was
forsworn
Scarcely
have
coveted
what
was
mine
own
At
no
time
broke
my
faith
would
not
betray
The
devil
to
his
fellow
and
delight
No
less
in
truth
than
life
My
first
false
speaking
Was
this
upon
myself
What
I
am
truly
Is
thine
and
my
poor
country
s
to
command
Whither
indeed
before
thy
here
approach
Old
Siward
with
ten
thousand
warlike
men
Already
at
a
point
was
setting
forth
Now
we
ll
together
and
the
chance
of
goodness
Be
like
our
warranted
quarrel
Why
are
you
silent
MACDUFF
Such
welcome
and
unwelcome
things
at
once
Tis
hard
to
reconcile
Enter
a
Doctor
MALCOLM
Well
more
anon
Comes
the
King
forth
I
pray
you
DOCTOR
Ay
sir
there
are
a
crew
of
wretched
souls
That
stay
his
cure
Their
malady
convinces
The
great
assay
of
art
but
at
his
touch
Such
sanctity
hath
heaven
given
his
hand
They
presently
amend
MALCOLM
I
thank
you
Doctor
Exit
Doctor
MACDUFF
What
s
the
disease
he
means
MALCOLM
Tis
call
d
the
evil
A
most
miraculous
work
in
this
good
King
Which
often
since
my
here
remain
in
England
I
have
seen
him
do
How
he
solicits
heaven
Himself
best
knows
but
strangely
visited
people
All
swol
n
and
ulcerous
pitiful
to
the
eye
The
mere
despair
of
surgery
he
cures
Hanging
a
golden
stamp
about
their
necks
Put
on
with
holy
prayers
and
tis
spoken
To
the
succeeding
royalty
he
leaves
The
healing
benediction
With
this
strange
virtue
