If

Absent

And

To

What

Young

This

The

But
I

prophesy
th

On

He
has
my
dying
voice
So
tell
him
with
th
occurrents
more
and
less
Which
have
solicited
the
rest
is
silence
Dies
Hor
Now
cracks
a
noble
heart
Good
night
sweet
prince
And
flights
of
angels
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
March
within
Why
does
the
drum
come
hither
Enter
Fortinbras
and
English
Ambassadors
with
Drum
Colours
and
Attendants
Fort
Where
is
this
sight
Hor
What
is
it
you
will
see
If
aught
of
woe
or
wonder
cease
your
search
Fort
This
quarry
cries
on
havoc
O
proud
Death
What
feast
is
toward
in
thine
eternal
cell
That
thou
so
many
princes
at
a
shot
So
bloodily
hast
struck
Ambassador
The
sight
is
dismal
And
our
affairs
from
England
come
too
late
The
ears
are
senseless
that
should
give
us
bearing
To
tell
him
his
commandment
is
fulfill
d
That
Rosencrantz
and
Guildenstern
are
dead
Where
should
We
have
our
thanks
Hor
Not
from
his
mouth
Had
it
th
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
He
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
But
since
so
jump
upon
this
bloody
question
You
from
the
Polack
wars
and
you
from
England
Are
here
arriv
d
give
order
that
these
bodies
High
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
And
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
How
these
things
came
about
So
shall
You
hear
Of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
Of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
Of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forc
d
cause
And
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
Fall
n
on
th
inventors
heads
All
this
can
I
Truly
deliver
Fort
Let
us
haste
to
hear
it
And
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
For
me
with
sorrow
I
embrace
my
fortune
I
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
Which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
Hor
Of
that
I
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
And
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
But
let
this
same
be
presently
perform
d
Even
while
men
s
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
On
plots
and
errors
happen
Fort
Let
four
captains
Bear
Hamlet
like
a
soldier
to
the
stage
For
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
To
have
prov
d
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
The
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
Speak
loudly
for
him
Take
up
the
bodies
Such
a
sight
as
this
Becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
Go
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
Exeunt
marching
after
the
which
a
peal
of
ordnance
are
shot
off

So

Find

for

And

short

To

No

Of

Those

Which
like
the

of
a
troubled
heaven
All
of
one
nature
of
one
substance
bred
Did
lately
meet
in
the
intestine
shock
And
furious
close
of

butchery
Shall

in

March
all
one
way
and

Against

The

No

Therefore

As

as
to
the
sepulchre
of
Christ
Whose
soldier
now
under
whose
blessed
cross
We
are
impressed
and
engag

to
fight
Forthwith
a
power
of
English
shall
we
levy
Whose
arms
were
moulded
in
their
mother

womb
To
chase
these
pagans
in
those
holy
fields
Over
whose
acres
walk
d
those
blessed
feet
Which
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
were

For
our
advantage
on
the
bitter
cross
But
this
our
purpose
now
is
twelvemonth
old
And
bootless
tis
to
tell
you
we
will
go
Therefore
we
meet
not
now
Then
let
me
hear
Of
you
my
gentle
cousin
Westmoreland
What
yesternight
our
Council
did
decree
In
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
West
My
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
And
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
But
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
A
post
from
Wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
Whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
Mortimer
Leading
the
men
of
Herefordshire
to
fight
Against
the
irregular
and
wild
Glendower
Was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
Welshman
taken
A
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
Upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
Such
beastly
shameless
transformation
By
those
Welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
Without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
King
It
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
Brake
off
our
business
for
the
Holy
Land
West
This
match
d
with
other
did
my
gracious
lord
For
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
Came
from
the
North
and
thus
it
did
import
On
Holy
rood
Day
the
gallant
Hotspur
there
Young
Harry
Percy
and
brave
Archibald
That
ever
valiant
and
approved
Scot
At
Holmedon
met
Where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
As
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
And
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
For
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
And
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
Uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way

Here

a
true
industrious

lighted
from
his
horse
Stain
d
with
the
variation
of
each
soil
Betwixt
that
Holmedon
and
this
seat
of
ours
And
he
hath
brought
us
smooth
and
welcome
news
The
Earl
of
Douglas
is
discomfited
Ten
thousand
bold
Scots
two
and
twenty
knights
Balk
d
in
their

Earl
of
Fife

To
beaten
Douglas
and
the
Earl
of
Athol
Of
Murray
Angus
and
Menteith
And
is
not
this
an
honourable
spoil
A
gallant
prize
Ha
cousin
is
it
not
West
In
faith
It
is
a
conquest
for
a
prince
to
boast
of
King
Yea
there
thou
mak
st
me
sad
and
mak
st
me
sin
In
envy
that
my
Lord
Northumberland
Should
be
the
father
to
so
blest
a
son
A
son
who
is
the
theme
of
honour
s
tongue
Amongst
a
grove
the
very
straightest
plant
Who
is
sweet
Fortune
s
minion
and
her
pride
Whilst
I
by
looking
on
the
praise
of
him
See
riot
and
dishonour
stain
the
brow
Of
my
young
Harry
O
that
it
could
be
prov
d
That
some
night
tripping
fairy
had
exchang
d
In
cradle
clothes
our
children
where
they
lay
And
call
d
mine
Percy
his
Plantagenet
Then
would
I
have
his
Harry
and
he
mine
But
let
him
from
my
thoughts
What
think
you
coz
Of
this
young
Percy
s
pride
The
prisoners
Which
he
in
this
adventure
hath
surpris
d
To
his
own
use
he
keeps
and
sends
me
word
I
shall
have
none
but
Mordake
Earl
of
Fife
West
This
is
his
uncle
s
teaching
this
Worcester
Malevolent
to
you
In
all
aspects
Which
makes
him
prune
himself
and
bristle
up
The
crest
of
youth
against
your
dignity
King
But
I
have
sent
for
him
to
answer
this
And
for
this
cause
awhile
we
must
neglect
Our
holy
purpose
to
Jerusalem
Cousin
on
Wednesday
next
our
council
we
Will
hold
at
Windsor
So
inform
the
lords
But
come
yourself
with
speed
to
us
again
For
more
is
to
be
said
and
to
be
done
Than
out

can
be
uttered

An

Enter
Prince
of

and
Sir
John
Falstaff
Fal
Now
Hal
what
time
of
day
is
it
lad
Prince
Thou
art
so
fat
witted
with
drinking
of
old
sack
and
unbuttoning
thee
after
supper
and
sleeping
upon
benches
after
noon
that
thou
hast
forgotten
to
demand
that
truly
which
thou
wouldest
truly
know
What
a
devil
hast
thou
to
do
with
the
time
of
the
day
Unless
hours
were
cups
of
sack
and
minutes
capons
and
clocks
the
tongues
of
bawds
and
dials
the
signs
of
leaping
houses
and
the
blessed
sun
himself
a
fair
hot
wench
in
flame
coloured
taffeta
I
see
no
reason
why
thou
shouldst
be
so
superfluous
to
demand
the
time
of
the
day
Fal
Indeed
you
come
near
me
now
Hal
for
we
that
take
purses
go
by
the
moon
And
the
seven
stars
and
not
by
Phoebus
he
that
wand
ring
knight
so
fair
And
I
prithee
sweet
wag
when
thou
art
king
as
God
save
thy
Grace
Majesty
I
should
say
for
grace
thou
wilt
have
none
Prince
What
none
Fal
No
by
my
troth
not
so
much
as
will
serve
to
be
prologue
to
an
egg
and
butter
Prince
Well
how
then
Come
roundly
roundly
Fal
Marry
then
sweet
wag
when
thou
art
king
let
not
us
that
are
squires
of
the
night
s
body
be
called
thieves
of
the
day
s
beauty
Let
us
be
Diana
s
Foresters
Gentlemen
of
the
Shade
Minions
of
the
Moon
and
let
men
say
we
be
men
of
good
government
being
governed
as
the
sea
is
by
our
noble
and
chaste
mistress
the
moon
under
whose
countenance
we
steal
Prince
Thou
sayest
well
and
it
holds
well
too
for
the
fortune
of
us
that
are
the
moon
s
men
doth
ebb
and
flow
like
the
sea
being
governed
as
the
sea
is
by
the
moon
As
for
proof
now
a
purse
of
gold

Well
Hal

in

waiting

I
can
tell

Prince
For
obtaining

Yea

I

An

about
you

Thou

O

hast
done
much
harm

for
it
Before

But

There

I
have

Gadshill
lies

Rochester
I
have
bespoke
supper

secure

Why

Well

Poins
Sir

I
prithee
leave
the
Prince
and

I
will
lay
him
down
such
reasons
for
this
adventure
that
he
shall
go
Fal
Well
God
give
thee
the
spirit
of
persuasion
and
him
the
ears
of
profiting
that
what
thou
speakest
may
move

what
he
hears
may
be
believed
that
the
true

may
for
recreation
sake
prove
a
false

Farewell

Exit
Falstaff
Poins
Now
my
good
sweet
honey
lord
ride
with
us
to
morrow
I
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
I
cannot
manage
alone
Falstaff
Bardolph
Peto
and
Gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
I
will
not
be
there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
I
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
off
from
my
shoulders
Prince
How
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
Poins
Why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
we
ll
set
upon
them
Prince
Yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
Poins
Tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
I
ll
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
wizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
I
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
immask
our
noted
outward
garments
Prince
Yea
but
I
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
Poins
Well
for
two
of
them
I
know
them
to
be
as
true
bred
cowards
as
ever
turn
d
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
I
ll
forswear
arms
The
virtue
of
this
jest
will
lie
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
Prince
Well
I
ll
go
with
thee
Provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
to
night
in
Eastcheap
There
I
ll
sup
Farewell
Poins
Farewell
my
lord
Exit
Prince
I
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
The
unyok
d
humour
of
your
idleness
Yet
herein
will
I
imitate
the
sun
Who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
To
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
That
when
he
please
again
to
lie
himself
Being
wanted
he
may
be
more
wond
red
at
By
breaking
through
the
foul
and
ugly
mists
Of
vapours
that
did
seem
to
strangle
him
If
all
the
year
were
playing
holidays
To
sport
would
be
as
tedious
as
to
work
But
when
they
seldom
come
they
wish
d
for
come
And
nothing
pleaseth
but
rare
accidents
So
when
this
loose
behaviour
I
throw
off
And
pay
the
debt
I
never
promised
By
how
much
better
than
my
word
I
am
By
so
much
shall
I
falsify
men
s
hopes
And
like
bright
metal
on
a
sullen
ground
