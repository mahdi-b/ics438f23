In
sleep
a
king
but
waking
no
such
matter
88
When
thou
shalt
be
disposed
to
set
me
light
And
place
my
merit
in
the
eye
of
scorn
Upon
thy
side
against
my
self
I
ll
fight
And
prove
thee
virtuous
though
thou
art
forsworn
With
mine
own
weakness
being
best
acquainted
Upon
thy
part
I
can
set
down
a
story
Of
faults
concealed
wherein
I
am
attainted
That
thou
in
losing
me
shalt
win
much
glory
And
I
by
this
will
be
a
gainer
too
For
bending
all
my
loving
thoughts
on
thee
The
injuries
that
to
my
self
I
do
Doing
thee
vantage
double
vantage
me
Such
is
my
love
to
thee
I
so
belong
That
for
thy
right
my
self
will
bear
all
wrong
89
Say
that
thou
didst
forsake
me
for
some
fault
And
I
will
comment
upon
that
offence
Speak
of
my
lameness
and
I
straight
will
halt
Against
thy
reasons
making
no
defence
Thou
canst
not
love
disgrace
me
half
so
ill
To
set
a
form
upon
desired
change
As
I
ll
my
self
disgrace
knowing
thy
will
I
will
acquaintance
strangle
and
look
strange
Be
absent
from
thy
walks
and
in
my
tongue
Thy
sweet
beloved
name
no
more
shall
dwell
Lest
I
too
much
profane
should
do
it
wronk
And
haply
of
our
old
acquaintance
tell
For
thee
against
my
self
I
ll
vow
debate
For
I
must
ne
er
love
him
whom
thou
dost
hate
90
Then
hate
me
when
thou
wilt
if
ever
now
Now
while
the
world
is
bent
my
deeds
to
cross
join
with
the
spite
of
fortune
make
me
bow
And
do
not
drop
in
for
an
after
loss
Ah
do
not
when
my
heart
hath
scaped
this
sorrow
Come
in
the
rearward
of
a
conquered
woe
Give
not
a
windy
night
a
rainy
morrow
To
linger
out
a
purposed
overthrow
If
thou
wilt
leave
me
do
not
leave
me
last
When
other
petty
griefs
have
done
their
spite
But
in
the
onset
come
so
shall
I
taste
At
first
the
very
worst
of
fortune
s
might
And
other
strains
of
woe
which
now
seem
woe
Compared
with
loss
of
thee
will
not
seem
so
91
Some
glory
in
their
birth
some
in
their
skill
Some
in
their
wealth
some
in
their
body
s
force
Some
in
their
garments
though
new
fangled
ill
Some
in
their
hawks
and
hounds
some
in
their
horse
And
every
humour
hath
his
adjunct
pleasure
Wherein
it
finds
a
joy
above
the
rest
But
these
particulars
are
not
my
measure
All
these
I
better
in
one
general
best
Thy
love
is
better
than
high
birth
to
me
Richer
than
wealth
prouder
than
garments
costs
Of
more
delight
than
hawks
and
horses
be
And
having
thee
of
all
men
s
pride
I
boast
Wretched
in
this
alone
that
thou
mayst
take
All
this
away
and
me
most
wretchcd
make
92
But
do
thy
worst
to
steal
thy
self
away
For
term
of
life
thou
art
assured
mine
And
life
no
longer
than
thy
love
will
stay
For
it
depends
upon
that
love
of
thine
Then
need
I
not
to
fear
the
worst
of
wrongs
When
in
the
least
of
them
my
life
hath
end
I
see
a
better
state
to
me
belongs
Than
that
which
on
thy
humour
doth
depend
Thou
canst
not
vex
me
with
inconstant
mind
Since
that
my
life
on
thy
revolt
doth
lie
O
what
a
happy
title
do
I
find
Happy
to
have
thy
love
happy
to
die
But
what
s
so
blessed
fair
that
fears
no
blot
Thou
mayst
be
false
and
yet
I
know
it
not
93
So
shall
I
live
supposing
thou
art
true
Like
a
deceived
husband
so
love
s
face
May
still
seem
love
to
me
though
altered
new
Thy
looks
with
me
thy
heart
in
other
place
For
there
can
live
no
hatred
in
thine
eye
Therefore
in
that
I
cannot
know
thy
change
In
many
s
looks
the
false
heart
s
history
Is
writ
in
moods
and
frowns
and
wrinkles
strange
But
heaven
in
thy
creation
did
decree
That
in
thy
face
sweet
love
should
ever
dwell
Whate
er
thy
thoughts
or
thy
heart
s
workings
be
Thy
looks
should
nothing
thence
but
sweetness
tell
How
like
Eve
s
apple
doth
thy
beauty
grow
If
thy
sweet
virtue
answer
not
thy
show
94
They
that
have
power
to
hurt
and
will
do
none
That
do
not
do
the
thing
they
most
do
show
Who
moving
others
are
themselves
as
stone
Unmoved
cold
and
to
temptation
slow
They
rightly
do
inherit
heaven
s
graces
And
husband
nature
s
riches
from
expense
Tibey
are
the
lords
and
owners
of
their
faces
Others
but
stewards
of
their
excellence
The
summer
s
flower
is
to
the
summer
sweet
Though
to
it
self
it
only
live
and
die
But
if
that
flower
with
base
infection
meet
The
basest
weed
outbraves
his
dignity
For
sweetest
things
turn
sourest
by
their
deeds
Lilies
that
fester
smell
far
worse
than
weeds
95
How
sweet
and
lovely
dost
thou
make
the
shame
Which
like
a
canker
in
the
fragrant
rose
Doth
spot
the
beauty
of
thy
budding
name
O
in
what
sweets
dost
thou
thy
sins
enclose
That
tongue
that
tells
the
story
of
thy
days
Making
lascivious
comments
on
thy
sport
Cannot
dispraise
but
in
a
kind
of
praise
Naming
thy
name
blesses
an
ill
report
O
what
a
mansion
have
those
vices
got
Which
for
their
habitation
chose
out
thee
Where
beauty
s
veil
doth
cover
every
blot
And
all
things
turns
to
fair
that
eyes
can
see
Take
heed
dear
heart
of
this
large
privilege
The
hardest
knife
ill
used
doth
lose
his
edge
96
Some
say
thy
fault
is
youth
some
wantonness
Some
say
thy
grace
is
youth
and
gentle
sport
Both
grace
and
faults
are
loved
of
more
and
less
Thou
mak
st
faults
graces
that
to
thee
resort
As
on
the
finger
of
a
throned
queen
The
basest
jewel
will
be
well
esteemed
So
are
those
errors
that
in
thee
are
seen
To
truths
translated
and
for
true
things
deemed
How
many
lambs
might
the
stern
wolf
betray
If
like
a
lamb
he
could
his
looks
translate
How
many
gazers
mightst
thou
lead
away
if
thou
wouldst
use
the
strength
of
all
thy
state
But
do
not
so
I
love
thee
in
such
sort
As
thou
being
mine
mine
is
thy
good
report
97
How
like
a
winter
hath
my
absence
been
From
thee
the
pleasure
of
the
fleeting
year
What
freezings
have
I
felt
what
dark
days
seen
What
old
December
s
bareness
everywhere
And
yet
this
time
removed
was
summer
s
time
The
teeming
autumn
big
with
rich
increase
Bearing
the
wanton
burden
of
the
prime
Like
widowed
wombs
after
their
lords
decease
Yet
this
abundant
issue
seemed
to
me
But
hope
of
orphans
and
unfathered
fruit
For
summer
and
his
pleasures
wait
on
thee
And
thou
away
the
very
birds
are
mute
Or
if
they
sing
tis
with
so
dull
a
cheer
That
leaves
look
pale
dreading
the
winter
s
near
98
From
you
have
I
been
absent
in
the
spring
When
proud
pied
April
dressed
in
all
his
trim
Hath
put
a
spirit
of
youth
in
every
thing
That
heavy
Saturn
laughed
and
leaped
with
him
Yet
nor
the
lays
of
birds
nor
the
sweet
smell
Of
different
flowers
in
odour
and
in
hue
Could
make
me
any
summer
s
story
tell
Or
from
their
proud
lap
pluck
them
where
they
grew
Nor
did
I
wonder
at
the
lily
s
white
Nor
praise
the
deep
vermilion
in
the
rose
They
were
but
sweet
but
figures
of
delight
Drawn
after
you
you
pattern
of
all
those
Yet
seemed
it
winter
still
and
you
away
As
with
your
shadow
I
with
these
did
play
99
The
forward
violet
thus
did
I
chide
Sweet
thief
whence
didst
thou
steal
thy
sweet
that
smells
If
not
from
my
love
s
breath
The
purple
pride
Which
on
thy
soft
check
for
complexion
dwells
In
my
love
s
veins
thou
hast
too
grossly
dyed
The
lily
I
condemned
for
thy
hand
And
buds
of
marjoram
had
stol
n
thy
hair
The
roses
fearfully
on
thorns
did
stand
One
blushing
shame
another
white
despair
A
third
nor
red
nor
white
had
stol
n
of
both
And
to
his
robbery
had
annexed
thy
breath
But
for
his
theft
in
pride
of
all
his
growth
A
vengeful
canker
eat
him
up
to
death
More
flowers
I
noted
yet
I
none
could
see
But
sweet
or
colour
it
had
stol
n
from
thee
100
Where
art
thou
Muse
that
thou
forget
st
so
long
To
speak
of
that
which
gives
thee
all
thy
might
Spend
st
thou
thy
fury
on
some
worthless
song
Darkening
thy
power
to
lend
base
subjects
light
Return
forgetful
Muse
and
straight
redeem
In
gentle
numbers
time
so
idly
spent
Sing
to
the
ear
that
doth
thy
lays
esteem
And
gives
thy
pen
both
skill
and
argument
Rise
resty
Muse
my
love
s
sweet
face
survey
If
time
have
any
wrinkle
graven
there
If
any
be
a
satire
to
decay
And
make
time
s
spoils
despised
everywhere
Give
my
love
fame
faster
than
Time
wastes
life
So
thou
prevent
st
his
scythe
and
crooked
knife
101
O
truant
Muse
what
shall
be
thy
amends
For
thy
neglect
of
truth
in
beauty
dyed
Both
truth
and
beauty
on
my
love
depends
So
dost
thou
too
and
therein
dignified
Make
answer
Muse
wilt
thou
not
haply
say
Truth
needs
no
colour
with
his
colour
fixed
Beauty
no
pencil
beauty
s
truth
to
lay
But
best
is
best
if
never
intermixed
Because
he
needs
no
praise
wilt
thou
be
dumb
Excuse
not
silence
so
for
t
lies
in
thee
To
make
him
much
outlive
a
gilded
tomb
And
to
be
praised
of
ages
yet
to
be
Then
do
thy
office
Muse
I
teach
thee
how
To
make
him
seem
long
hence
as
he
shows
now
102
My
love
is
strengthened
though
more
weak
in
seeming
I
love
not
less
though
less
the
show
appear
That
love
is
merchandized
whose
rich
esteeming
The
owner
s
tongue
doth
publish
every
where
Our
love
was
new
and
then
but
in
the
spring
When
I
was
wont
to
greet
it
with
my
lays
As
Philomel
in
summer
s
front
doth
sing
And
stops
her
pipe
in
growth
of
riper
days
Not
that
the
summer
is
less
pleasant
now
Than
when
her
mournful
hymns
did
hush
the
night
But
that
wild
music
burthens
every
bough
And
sweets
grown
common
lose
their
dear
delight
Therefore
like
her
I
sometime
hold
my
tongue
Because
I
would
not
dull
you
with
my
song
103
Alack
what
poverty
my
muse
brings
forth
That
having
such
a
scope
to
show
her
pride
The
argument
all
bare
is
of
more
worth
Than
when
it
hath
my
added
praise
beside
O
blame
me
not
if
I
no
more
can
write
Look
in
your
glass
and
there
appears
a
face
That
over
goes
my
blunt
invention
quite
Dulling
my
lines
and
doing
me
disgrace
Were
it
not
sinful
then
striving
to
mend
To
mar
the
subject
that
before
was
well
For
to
no
other
pass
my
verses
tend
Than
of
your
graces
and
your
gifts
to
tell
And
more
much
more
than
in
my
verse
can
sit
Your
own
glass
shows
you
when
you
look
in
it
104
To
me
fair
friend
you
never
can
be
old
For
as
you
were
when
first
your
eye
I
eyed
Such
seems
your
beauty
still
three
winters
cold
Have
from
the
forests
shook
three
summers
pride
Three
beauteous
springs
to
yellow
autumn
turned
In
process
of
the
seasons
have
I
seen
Three
April
perfumes
in
three
hot
Junes
burned
Since
first
I
saw
you
fresh
which
yet
are
green
Ah
yet
doth
beauty
like
a
dial
hand
Steal
from
his
figure
and
no
pace
perceived
So
your
sweet
hue
which
methinks
still
doth
stand
Hath
motion
and
mine
eye
may
be
deceived
For
fear
of
which
hear
this
thou
age
unbred
Ere
you
were
born
was
beauty
s
summer
dead
105
Let
not
my
love
be
called
idolatry
Nor
my
beloved
as
an
idol
show
Since
all
alike
my
songs
and
praises
be
To
one
of
one
still
such
and
ever
so
Kind
is
my
love
to
day
to
morrow
kind
Still
constant
in
a
wondrous
excellence
Therefore
my
verse
to
constancy
confined
One
thing
expressing
leaves
out
difference
Fair
kind
and
true
is
all
my
argument
Fair
kind
and
true
varying
to
other
words
And
in
this
change
is
my
invention
spent
Three
themes
in
one
which
wondrous
scope
affords
Fair
kind
and
true
have
often
lived
alone
Which
three
till
now
never
kept
seat
in
one
106
When
in
the
chronicle
of
wasted
time
I
see
descriptions
of
the
fairest
wights
And
beauty
making
beautiful
old
rhyme
In
praise
of
ladies
dead
and
lovely
knights
Then
in
the
blazon
of
sweet
beauty
s
best
Of
hand
of
foot
of
lip
of
eye
of
brow
I
see
their
antique
pen
would
have
expressed
Even
such
a
beauty
as
you
master
now
So
all
their
praises
are
but
prophecies
Of
this
our
time
all
you
prefiguring
And
for
they
looked
but
with
divining
eyes
They
had
not
skill
enough
your
worth
to
sing
For
we
which
now
behold
these
present
days
Have
eyes
to
wonder
but
lack
tongues
to
praise
107
Not
mine
own
fears
nor
the
prophetic
soul
Of
the
wide
world
dreaming
on
things
to
come
Can
yet
the
lease
of
my
true
love
control
Supposed
as
forfeit
to
a
confined
doom
The
mortal
moon
hath
her
eclipse
endured
And
the
sad
augurs
mock
their
own
presage
Incertainties
now
crown
themselves
assured
And
peace
proclaims
olives
of
endless
age
Now
with
the
drops
of
this
most
balmy
time
My
love
looks
fresh
and
death
to
me
subscribes
Since
spite
of
him
I
ll
live
in
this
poor
rhyme
While
he
insults
o
er
dull
and
speechless
tribes
And
thou
in
this
shalt
find
thy
monument
When
tyrants
crests
and
tombs
of
brass
are
spent
108
What
s
in
the
brain
that
ink
may
character
Which
hath
not
figured
to
thee
my
true
spirit
What
s
new
to
speak
what
now
to
register
That
may
express
my
love
or
thy
dear
merit
Nothing
sweet
boy
but
yet
like
prayers
divine
I
must
each
day
say
o
er
the
very
same
Counting
no
old
thing
old
thou
mine
I
thine
Even
as
when
first
I
hallowed
thy
fair
name
So
that
eternal
love
in
love
s
fresh
case
Weighs
not
the
dust
and
injury
of
age
Nor
gives
to
necessary
wrinkles
place
But
makes
antiquity
for
aye
his
page
Finding
the
first
conceit
of
love
there
bred
Where
time
and
outward
form
would
show
it
dead
109
O
never
say
that
I
was
false
of
heart
Though
absence
seemed
my
flame
to
qualify
As
easy
might
I
from
my
self
depart
As
from
my
soul
which
in
thy
breast
doth
lie
That
is
my
home
of
love
if
I
have
ranged
Like
him
that
travels
I
return
again
Just
to
the
time
not
with
the
time
exchanged
So
that
my
self
bring
water
for
my
stain
Never
believe
though
in
my
nature
reigned
All
frailties
that
besiege
all
kinds
of
blood
That
it
could
so
preposterously
be
stained
To
leave
for
nothing
all
thy
sum
of
good
For
nothing
this
wide
universe
I
call
Save
thou
my
rose
in
it
thou
art
my
all
110
Alas
tis
true
I
have
gone
here
and
there
And
made
my
self
a
motley
to
the
view
Gored
mine
own
thoughts
sold
cheap
what
is
most
dear
Made
old
offences
of
affections
new
Most
true
it
is
that
I
have
looked
on
truth
Askance
and
strangely
but
by
all
above
These
blenches
gave
my
heart
another
youth
And
worse
essays
proved
thee
my
best
of
love
Now
all
is
done
have
what
shall
have
no
end
Mine
appetite
I
never
more
will
grind
On
newer
proof
to
try
an
older
friend
A
god
in
love
to
whom
I
am
confined
Then
give
me
welcome
next
my
heaven
the
best
Even
to
thy
pure
and
most
most
loving
breast
111
O
for
my
sake
do
you
with
Fortune
chide
The
guilty
goddess
of
my
harmful
deeds
That
did
not
better
for
my
life
provide
Than
public
means
which
public
manners
breeds
Thence
comes
it
that
my
name
receives
a
brand
And
almost
thence
my
nature
is
subdued
To
what
it
works
in
like
the
dyer
s
hand
Pity
me
then
and
wish
I
were
renewed
Whilst
like
a
willing
patient
I
will
drink
Potions
of
eisel
gainst
my
strong
infection
No
bitterness
that
I
will
bitter
think
Nor
double
penance
to
correct
correction
Pity
me
then
dear
friend
and
I
assure
ye
Even
that
your
pity
is
enough
to
cure
me
112
Your
love
and
pity
doth
th
impression
fill
Which
vulgar
scandal
stamped
upon
my
brow
For
what
care
I
who
calls
me
well
or
ill
So
you
o
er
green
my
bad
my
good
allow
You
are
my
all
the
world
and
I
must
strive
To
know
my
shames
and
praises
from
your
tongue
None
else
to
me
nor
I
to
none
alive
That
my
steeled
sense
or
changes
right
or
wrong
In
so
profound
abysm
I
throw
all
care
Of
others
voices
that
my
adder
s
sense
To
critic
and
to
flatterer
stopped
are
Mark
how
with
my
neglect
I
do
dispense
You
are
so
strongly
in
my
purpose
bred
That
all
the
world
besides
methinks
are
dead
113
Since
I
left
you
mine
eye
is
in
my
mind
And
that
which
governs
me
to
go
about
Doth
part
his
function
and
is
partly
blind
Seems
seeing
but
effectually
is
out
For
it
no
form
delivers
to
the
heart
Of
bird
of
flower
or
shape
which
it
doth
latch
Of
his
quick
objects
hath
the
mind
no
part
Nor
his
own
vision
holds
what
it
doth
catch
For
if
it
see
the
rud
st
or
gentlest
sight
The
most
sweet
favour
or
deformed
st
creature
The
mountain
or
the
sea
the
day
or
night
The
crow
or
dove
it
shapes
them
to
your
feature
Incapable
of
more
replete
with
you
My
most
true
mind
thus
maketh
mine
untrue
114
Or
whether
doth
my
mind
being
crowned
with
you
Drink
up
the
monarch
s
plague
this
flattery
Or
whether
shall
I
say
mine
eye
saith
true
And
that
your
love
taught
it
this
alchemy
To
make
of
monsters
and
things
indigest
Such
cherubins
as
your
sweet
self
resemble
Creating
every
bad
a
perfect
best
As
fast
as
objects
to
his
beams
assemble
O
tis
the
first
tis
flattery
in
my
seeing
And
my
great
mind
most
kingly
drinks
it
up
Mine
eye
well
knows
what
with
his
gust
is
greeing
And
to
his
palate
doth
prepare
the
cup
If
it
be
poisoned
tis
the
lesser
sin
That
mine
eye
loves
it
and
doth
first
begin
115
Those
lines
that
I
before
have
writ
do
lie
Even
those
that
said
I
could
not
love
you
dearer
Yet
then
my
judgment
knew
no
reason
why
My
most
full
flame
should
afterwards
burn
clearer
But
reckoning
time
whose
millioned
accidents
Creep
in
twixt
vows
and
change
decrees
of
kings
Tan
sacred
beauty
blunt
the
sharp
st
intents
Divert
strong
minds
to
the
course
of
alt
ring
things
Alas
why
fearing
of
time
s
tyranny
Might
I
not
then
say
Now
I
love
you
best
When
I
was
certain
o
er
incertainty
Crowning
the
present
doubting
of
the
rest
Love
is
a
babe
then
might
I
not
say
so
To
give
full
growth
to
that
which
still
doth
grow
116
Let
me
not
to
the
marriage
of
true
minds
Admit
impediments
love
is
not
love
Which
alters
when
it
alteration
finds
Or
bends
with
the
remover
to
remove
O
no
it
is
an
ever
fixed
mark
That
looks
on
tempests
and
is
never
shaken
It
is
the
star
to
every
wand
ring
bark
Whose
worth
s
unknown
although
his
height
be
taken
Love
s
not
Time
s
fool
though
rosy
lips
and
cheeks
Within
his
bending
sickle
s
compass
come
Love
alters
not
with
his
brief
hours
and
weeks
But
bears
it
out
even
to
the
edge
of
doom
If
this
be
error
and
upon
me
proved
I
never
writ
nor
no
man
ever
loved
117
Accuse
me
thus
that
I
have
scanted
all
Wherein
I
should
your
great
deserts
repay
Forgot
upon
your
dearest
love
to
call
Whereto
all
bonds
do
tie
me
day
by
day
That
I
have
frequent
been
with
unknown
minds
And
given
to
time
your
own
dear
purchased
right
That
I
have
hoisted
sail
to
all
the
winds
Which
should
transport
me
farthest
from
your
sight
Book
both
my
wilfulness
and
errors
down
And
on
just
proof
surmise
accumulate
Bring
me
within
the
level
of
your
frown
But
shoot
not
at
me
in
your
wakened
hate
Since
my
appeal
says
I
did
strive
to
prove
The
constancy
and
virtue
of
your
love
118
Like
as
to
make
our
appetite
more
keen
With
eager
compounds
we
our
palate
urge
As
to
prevent
our
maladies
unseen
We
sicken
to
shun
sickness
when
we
purge
Even
so
being
full
of
your
ne
er
cloying
sweetness
To
bitter
sauces
did
I
frame
my
feeding
And
sick
of
welfare
found
a
kind
of
meetness
To
be
diseased
ere
that
there
was
true
needing
Thus
policy
in
love
t
anticipate
The
ills
that
were
not
grew
to
faults
assured
And
brought
to
medicine
a
healthful
state
Which
rank
of
goodness
would
by
ill
be
cured
But
thence
I
learn
and
find
the
lesson
true
Drugs
poison
him
that
so
feil
sick
of
you
119
What
potions
have
I
drunk
of
Siren
tears
Distilled
from
limbecks
foul
as
hell
within
Applying
fears
to
hopes
and
hopes
to
fears
Still
losing
when
I
saw
my
self
to
win
What
wretched
errors
hath
my
heart
committed
Whilst
it
hath
thought
it
self
so
blessed
never
How
have
mine
eyes
out
of
their
spheres
been
fitted
In
the
distraction
of
this
madding
fever
O
benefit
of
ill
now
I
find
true
That
better
is
by
evil
still
made
better
And
ruined
love
when
it
is
built
anew
Grows
fairer
than
at
first
more
strong
far
greater
So
I
return
rebuked
to
my
content
And
gain
by
ills
thrice
more
than
I
have
spent
120
That
you
were
once
unkind
befriends
me
now
And
for
that
sorrow
which
I
then
did
feel
Needs
must
I
under
my
transgression
bow
Unless
my
nerves
were
brass
or
hammered
steel
For
if
you
were
by
my
unkindness
shaken
As
I
by
yours
y
have
passed
a
hell
of
time
And
I
a
tyrant
have
no
leisure
taken
To
weigh
how
once
I
suffered
in
your
crime
O
that
our
night
of
woe
might
have
remembered
My
deepest
sense
how
hard
true
sorrow
hits
And
soon
to
you
as
you
to
me
then
tendered
The
humble
salve
which
wounded
bosoms
fits
But
that
your
trespass
now
becomes
a
fee
Mine
ransoms
yours
and
yours
must
ransom
me
121
Tis
better
to
be
vile
than
vile
esteemed
When
not
to
be
receives
reproach
of
being
