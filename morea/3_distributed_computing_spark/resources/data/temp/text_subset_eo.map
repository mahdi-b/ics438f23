Costard
she
deserves
well
MOTH
Aside
To
be
whipt
and
yet
a
better
love
than
my
master
ARMADO
Sing
boy
my
spirit
grows
heavy
in
love
MOTH
And
that
s
great
marvel
loving
a
light
wench
ARMADO
I
say
sing
MOTH
Forbear
till
this
company
be
past
Enter
DULL
COSTARD
and
JAQUENETTA
DULL
Sir
the
Duke
s
pleasure
is
that
you
keep
Costard
safe
and
you
must
suffer
him
to
take
no
delight
nor
no
penance
but
a
must
fast
three
days
a
week
For
this
damsel
I
must
keep
her
at
the
park
she
is
allow
d
for
the
day
woman
Fare
you
well
ARMADO
I
do
betray
myself
with
blushing
Maid
JAQUENETTA
Man
ARMADO
I
will
visit
thee
at
the
lodge
JAQUENETTA
That
s
hereby
ARMADO
I
know
where
it
is
situate
JAQUENETTA
Lord
how
wise
you
are
ARMADO
I
will
tell
thee
wonders
JAQUENETTA
With
that
face
ARMADO
I
love
thee
JAQUENETTA
So
I
heard
you
say
ARMADO
And
so
farewell
JAQUENETTA
Fair
weather
after
you
DULL
Come
Jaquenetta
away
Exit
with
JAQUENETTA
ARMADO
Villain
thou
shalt
fast
for
thy
offences
ere
thou
be
pardoned
COSTARD
Well
sir
I
hope
when
I
do
it
I
shall
do
it
on
a
full
stomach
ARMADO
Thou
shalt
be
heavily
punished
COSTARD
I
am
more
bound
to
you
than
your
fellows
for
they
are
but
lightly
rewarded
ARMADO
Take
away
this
villain
shut
him
up
MOTH
Come
you
transgressing
slave
away
COSTARD
Let
me
not
be
pent
up
sir
I
will
fast
being
loose
MOTH
No
sir
that
were
fast
and
loose
Thou
shalt
to
prison
COSTARD
Well
if
ever
I
do
see
the
merry
days
of
desolation
that
I
have
seen
some
shall
see
MOTH
What
shall
some
see
COSTARD
Nay
nothing
Master
Moth
but
what
they
look
upon
It
is
not
for
prisoners
to
be
too
silent
in
their
words
and
therefore
I
will
say
nothing
I
thank
God
I
have
as
little
patience
as
another
man
and
therefore
I
can
be
quiet
Exeunt
MOTH
and
COSTARD
ARMADO
I
do
affect
the
very
ground
which
is
base
where
her
shoe
which
is
baser
guided
by
her
foot
which
is
basest
doth
tread
I
shall
be
forsworn
which
is
a
great
argument
of
falsehood
if
I
love
And
how
can
that
be
true
love
which
is
falsely
attempted
Love
is
a
familiar
Love
is
a
devil
There
is
no
evil
angel
but
Love
Yet
was
Samson
so
tempted
and
he
had
an
excellent
strength
yet
was
Solomon
so
seduced
and
he
had
a
very
good
wit
Cupid
s
butt
shaft
is
too
hard
for
Hercules
club
and
therefore
too
much
odds
for
a
Spaniard
s
rapier
The
first
and
second
cause
will
not
serve
my
turn
the
passado
he
respects
not
the
duello
he
regards
not
his
disgrace
is
to
be
called
boy
but
his
glory
is
to
subdue
men
Adieu

PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
with
three
attending
ladies
ROSALINE
MARIA
KATHARINE
BOYET
and
two
other
LORDS
BOYET
Now
madam
summon
up
your
dearest
spirits
Consider
who
the
King
your
father
sends
To
whom
he
sends
and
what
s
his
embassy
Yourself
held
precious
in
the
world
s
esteem
To
parley
with
the
sole
inheritor
Of
all
perfections
that
a
man
may
owe
Matchless
Navarre
the
plea
of
no
less
weight
Than
Aquitaine
a
dowry
for
a
queen
Be
now
as
prodigal
of
all
dear
grace
As
Nature
was
in
making
graces
dear
When
she
did
starve
the
general
world
beside
And
prodigally
gave
them
all
to
you
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Good
Lord
Boyet
my
beauty
though
but
mean
Needs
not
the
painted
flourish
of
your
praise
Beauty
is
bought
by
judgment
of
the
eye
Not
utt
red
by
base
sale
of
chapmen
s
tongues
I
am
less
proud
to
hear
you
tell
my
worth
Than
you
much
willing
to
be
counted
wise
In
spending
your
wit
in
the
praise
of
mine
But
now
to
task
the
tasker
good
Boyet
You
are
not
ignorant
all
telling
fame
Doth
noise
abroad
Navarre
hath
made
a
vow
Till
painful
study
shall
outwear
three
years
No
woman
may
approach
his
silent
court
Therefore
to
s
seemeth
it
a
needful
course
Before
we
enter
his
forbidden
gates
To
know
his
pleasure
and
in
that
behalf
Bold
of
your
worthiness
we
single
you
As
our
best
moving
fair
solicitor
Tell
him
the
daughter
of
the
King
of
France
On
serious
business
craving
quick
dispatch
Importunes
personal
conference
with
his
Grace
Haste

so
much
while
we
attend
Like
humble
visag
d
suitors
his
high
will
BOYET
Proud
of
employment
willingly
I
go
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
All
pride
is
willing
pride
and
yours
is
so
Exit

Who
are

loving

That

this
virtuous
duke
FIRST
LORD
Lord
Longaville

one
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Know
you
the
man
MARIA
I
know
him
madam
at
a
marriage
feast
Between
Lord
Perigort
and
the
beauteous
heir
Of
Jaques
Falconbridge
solemnized
In
Normandy
saw
I
this
Longaville
A
man
of
sovereign
parts
peerless
esteem
d
Well
fitted
in
arts
glorious
in
arms
Nothing
becomes
him
ill
that
he
would
well
The
only
soil
of
his
fair
virtue
s
gloss
If
virtue
s
gloss
will
stain
with
any
soil
Is
a
sharp
wit
match
d
with
too
blunt
a
will
Whose
edge
hath
power
to
cut
whose
will
still
wills
It
should
none
spare
that
come
within
his
power
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Some
merry
mocking
lord
belike
is
t
so
MARIA
They
say
so
most
that
most
his
humours
know
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Such
short
liv
d
wits
do
wither
as
they
grow
Who
are
the
rest
KATHARINE
The
young
Dumain
a
well
accomplish
d
youth
Of
all
that
virtue
love
for
virtue
loved
Most
power
to
do
most
harm
least
knowing
ill
For
he
hath
wit
to
make
an
ill
shape
good
And
shape
to
win
grace
though
he
had
no
wit
I
saw
him
at
the
Duke
Alencon
s
once
And
much
too
little
of
that
good
I
saw
Is
my
report
to
his
great
worthiness
ROSALINE
Another
of
these
students
at
that
time
Was
there
with
him
if
I
have
heard
a
truth
Berowne
they
call
him
but
a
merrier
man
Within
the
limit
of
becoming
mirth
I
never
spent
an
hour
s
talk
withal
His
eye
begets
occasion
for
his
wit
For
every
object
that
the
one
doth
catch
The
other
turns
to
a
mirth
moving
jest
Which
his
fair
tongue
conceit
s
expositor
Delivers
in
such
apt
and
gracious
words
That
aged
ears
play
truant
at
his
tales
And
younger
hearings
are
quite
ravished
So
sweet
and
voluble
is
his
discourse
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
God
bless
my
ladies
Are
they
all
in
love
That
every
one
her
own
hath
garnished
With
such
bedecking
ornaments
of
praise
FIRST

PRINCESS

Now
what
admittance
lord
BOYET
Navarre

notice
of
your
fair
approach
And
he
and
his
competitors
in
oath
Were
all
address
d
to
meet
you
gentle
lady
Before
I
came
Marry
thus
much
I
have
learnt
He
rather
means
to
lodge
you
in
the
field
Like
one
that
comes
here
to
besiege
his
court
Than
seek
a
dispensation
for
his
oath
To
let
you
enter
his
unpeopled

PRINCESS
OF

Fair
I
give
you
back
again
and
welcome
I
have
not
yet
The
roof
of
this
court
is
too
high
to
be
yours
and
welcome
to
the
wide
fields
too
base
to
be
mine
KING
You
shall
be
welcome
madam
to
my
court
PRINCESS

I

be
welcome

He

Not
for

fair
madam
by
my
will
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Why

and
nothing

KING
Your
ladyship
is
ignorant
what
it
is
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Were
my
lord
so
his
ignorance
were
wise
Where
now
his
knowledge
must
prove
ignorance
I
hear
your
Grace
hath
sworn
out
house
keeping
Tis
deadly
sin
to
keep
that
oath
my
lord
And
sin
to
break
it
But
pardon
me
I
am
too
sudden
bold
To
teach
a
teacher

Vouchsafe

BEROWNE
Did
not
I
dance
with
you
in
Brabant
once
KATHARINE
Did
not
I
dance
with
you
in
Brabant
once
BEROWNE
I
know
you
did
KATHARINE
How
needless
was
it
then
to
ask
the
question
BEROWNE
You
must
not
be
so
quick
KATHARINE
Tis
long
of
you
that
spur
me
with
such
questions
BEROWNE
Your
wit
s
too
hot
it
speeds
too
fast
twill
tire
KATHARINE
Not
till
it
leave
the
rider
in
the
mire
BEROWNE
What
time

day
KATHARINE
The
hour
that
fools
should
ask
BEROWNE
Now

befall
your
mask
KATHARINE
Fair
fall
the
face
it
covers
BEROWNE
And
send
you
many
lovers
KATHARINE
Amen
so
you

none
BEROWNE
Nay
then
will
I
be
gone
KING
Madam
your
father
here
doth
intimate
The
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
Being
but
the
one
half
of
an
entire
sum
Disbursed
by
my
father
in
his
wars
But
say
that
he
or
we
as
neither
have
Receiv
d
that
sum
yet
there
remains
unpaid
A
hundred
thousand
more
in
surety
of
the
which
One
part
of
Aquitaine
is
bound
to
us
Although
not
valued
to
the
money
s
worth
If
then
the
King
your
father
will
restore
But
that
one
half
which
is
unsatisfied
We
will
give
up
our
right
in
Aquitaine
And
hold
fair
friendship
with
his
Majesty
But
that
it
seems
he
little
purposeth
For
here
he
doth
demand
to
have
repaid
A
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
not
demands
On
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
To
have
his
title
live
in
Aquitaine
Which
we
much
rather
had
depart
withal
And
have
the
money
by
our
father
lent
Than
Aquitaine
so
gelded
as
it
is
Dear
Princess
were
not
his
requests
so
far
From
reason
s
yielding
your
fair
self
should
make
A
yielding
gainst
some
reason
in
my
breast
And
go
well
satisfied
to
France
again
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
You
do
the
King
my
father
too
much
wrong
And
wrong
the
reputation
of
your
name
In
so
unseeming
to
confess
receipt
Of
that
which
hath
so
faithfully
been
paid
KING
I
do
protest
I
never
heard
of
it
And
if
you
prove
it
I
ll
repay
it
back
Or
yield
up
Aquitaine
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
We
arrest
your
word

Satisfy

To
morrow

All

Meantime

welcome
at

As

Make

A

her
in

LONGAVILLE
Perchance
light
in

I
desire
her
name
BOYET
She
hath
but
one
for
herself
to
desire
that

a
shame

Pray

Her

Good

LADIES

That

is
Berowne
the
merry
mad
cap
lord
Not
a
word
with
him
but
a
jest
BOYET
And
every
jest
but
a
word
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
It
was
well
done
of
you
to
take
him
at
his
word
BOYET
I
was
as
willing
to
grapple
as
he
was
to
board
KATHARINE
Two
hot
sheeps
marry
BOYET
And
wherefore
not
ships
No
sheep
sweet
lamb
unless
we
feed
on
your
lips
KATHARINE
You
sheep
and
I
pasture
shall
that
finish
the
jest
BOYET
So
you
grant
pasture
for
me
Offering
to
kiss
her
KATHARINE
Not
so
gentle
beast
My
lips
are
no
common
though
several
they
be
BOYET
Belonging
to
whom
KATHARINE
To
my
fortunes
and
me
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Good
wits
will
be
jangling
but
gentles
agree
This
civil
war
of
wits
were
much
better
used
On
Navarre
and
his
book
men
for
here
tis
abused
BOYET
If
my
observation
which
very
seldom
lies
By
the
heart
s
still
rhetoric
disclosed
with
eyes
Deceive
me
not
now
Navarre
is
infected
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
With
what
BOYET
With
that
which
we
lovers
entitle
affected
PRINCESS
OF
FRANCE
Your
reason
BOYET
Why
all
his
behaviours
did
make
their
retire
To
the
court
of
his
eye
peeping
thorough
desire
His
heart
like
an
agate
with
your
print
impressed
Proud
with
his
form
in
his
eye
pride
expressed
His
tongue
all
impatient
to
speak
and
not

SCENE
I
The
park
Enter
ARMADO
and
MOTH
ARMADO
Warble
child
make
passionate
my
sense
of
hearing
MOTH
sings
Concolinel
ARMADO
Sweet
air
Go
tenderness
of
years
take
this
key
give
enlargement
to
the
swain
bring
him
festinately
hither
I
must
employ
him
in
a
letter
to
my
love
MOTH
Master
will
you
win
your
love
with
a
French
brawl
ARMADO
How
meanest
thou
Brawling
in
French
MOTH
No
my
complete
master
but
to
jig
off
a
tune
at
the
tongue
s
end
canary
to
it
with
your
feet
humour
it
with
turning
up
your
eyelids
sigh
a
note
and
sing
a
note
sometime
through
the
throat
as
if
you
swallowed
love
with
singing
love
sometime
through
the
nose
as
if
you
snuff
d
up
love
by
smelling
love
with
your
hat
penthouse
like
o
er
the
shop
of
your
eyes
with
your
arms
cross
d
on
your
thin
belly
doublet
like
a
rabbit
on
a
spit
or
your
hands
in
your
pocket
like
a
man
after
the
old
painting
and
keep
not
too
long
in
one
tune
but
a
snip
and
away
These
are
complements
these
are
humours
these
betray
nice
wenches
that
would
be
betrayed
without
these
and
make
them
men
of
note
do
you
note
me
that
most
are
affected
to
these
ARMADO
How
hast
thou
purchased
this
experience
MOTH
By
my
penny
of
observation
ARMADO
But
O
but
O
MOTH
The
hobby
horse
is
forgot
ARMADO
Call
st
thou
my
love
hobby
horse
MOTH
No
master
the
hobby
horse
is
but
a
colt
and
your
love
perhaps
a
hackney
But
have
you
forgot
your
love
ARMADO
Almost
I
had
MOTH
Negligent
student
learn
her
by
heart
ARMADO
By
heart
and
in
heart
boy
MOTH
And
out
of
heart
master
all
those
three
I
will
prove
ARMADO
What
wilt
thou
prove
MOTH
A
man
if
I
live
and
this
by
in
and
without
upon
the
instant
By
heart
you
love
her
because
your
heart
cannot
come
by
her
in
heart
you
love
her
because
your
heart
is
in
love
with
her
and
out
of
heart
you
love
her
being
out
of
heart
that
you
cannot
enjoy
her
ARMADO
I
am
all
these
three
MOTH
And
three
times
as
much
more
and
yet
nothing
at
all
ARMADO
Fetch
hither
the
swain
he
must
carry
me
a
letter
MOTH
A
message
well
sympathiz
d
a
horse
to
be
ambassador
for
an
ass
ARMADO
Ha
ha
what
sayest
thou
MOTH
Marry
sir
you
must
send
the
ass
upon
the
horse
for
he
is
very
slow
gaited
But
I
go
ARMADO
The
way
is
but
short
away
MOTH
As
swift
as
lead
sir
ARMADO
The
meaning
pretty
ingenious
Is
not
lead
a
metal
heavy
dull
and
slow
MOTH
Minime
honest
master
or
rather
master
no
ARMADO
I
say
lead
is
slow
MOTH
You
are
too
swift
sir
to
say
so
Is
that
lead
slow
which
is
fir
d
from
a
gun
ARMADO
Sweet
smoke
of
rhetoric
He
reputes
me
a
cannon
and
the
bullet
that
s
he
I
shoot
thee
at
the
swain
MOTH
Thump
then
and
I
flee
Exit
ARMADO
A
most
acute
juvenal
volable
and
free
of
grace
By
thy
favour
sweet
welkin
I
must
sigh
in
thy
face
Most
rude
melancholy
valour
gives
thee
place
My
herald
is

Re

MOTH
with
COSTARD
MOTH
A

ARMADO
By
virtue
thou
enforcest
laughter
thy
silly
thought
my
spleen
the
heaving
of
my
lungs
provokes
me
to
ridiculous
smiling
O
pardon
me
my
stars
Doth
the
inconsiderate
take
salve
for
l
envoy
and
the
word

MOTH
Do

other
Is
not
l
envoy
a

ARMADO
No
page
it
is
an
epilogue
or
discourse
to
make
plain
Some
obscure
precedence
that
hath
tofore
been
sain
I
will
example
it
The
fox
the
ape
and
the
humble
bee
Were
still
at
odds
being
but
three
There
s
the
moral
Now
the
l
envoy
MOTH
I
will
add
the
l
envoy
Say
the
moral
again
ARMADO
The
fox
the
ape
and
the
humble
bee
Were
still
at
odds
being
but
three
MOTH
Until
the
goose
came
out
of
door
And
stay
d
the
odds
by
adding
four
Now
will
I
begin
your
moral
and
do
you
follow
with
my
l
envoy
The
fox
the
ape
and
the
humble
bee
Were
still
at
odds
being
but
three
ARMADO
Until

Staying

MOTH
A

ending
in
the

desire
more
COSTARD
The
boy
hath
sold
him
a
bargain
a
goose
that
s
flat
Sir
your
pennyworth
is
good
an
your
goose
be
fat
To
sell
a
bargain
well
is
as
cunning
as
fast
and
loose
Let
me
see
a
fat
l
envoy
ay
that
s
a
fat
goose
ARMADO
Come
hither
come
hither
How
did
this
argument
begin
MOTH
By
saying
that
a
costard
was
broken
in
a
shin
Then
call
d
you
for
the
l
envoy
COSTARD
True
and
I
for
a
plantain
Thus
came
your
argument
in
Then
the
boy
s
fat
l
envoy
the
goose
that
you
bought
And
he
ended
the
market
ARMADO
But
tell
me
how
was
there
a
costard
broken
in
a
shin
MOTH
I
will
tell
you
sensibly
COSTARD
Thou
hast
no
feeling
of
it
Moth
I
will
speak
that
l
envoy
I
Costard
running
out
that
was
safely
within
Fell
over
the
threshold
and
broke
my
shin
ARMADO
We
will
talk
no
more
of
this
matter
COSTARD
Till
there
be
more
matter
in
the
shin
ARMADO
Sirrah
Costard
I
will
enfranchise
thee
COSTARD
O
Marry
me
to
one
Frances
I
smell
some
l
envoy
some
goose
in
this
ARMADO
By
my
sweet
soul

setting
thee
at

enfreedoming
thy
person

immured

COSTARD
True

my
purgation
and
let
me
loose
ARMADO
I
give
thee
thy
liberty
set
thee
from

and
in
lieu
thereof
impose
on
thee
nothing
but

the
price
of
this
inkle
One
penny
No

a
remuneration
Why
