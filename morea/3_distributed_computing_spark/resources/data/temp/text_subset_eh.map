What

Kent
I
can
keep

a
curious
tale
in
telling

deliver
a
plain
message
bluntly
That
which
ordinary

are
fit

I
am
qualified
in
and
the
best
of
me
is
diligence
Lear
How
old
art
thou
Kent
Not
so
young

forty

Follow

My

I
know
not
what
the
matter
is
but
to
my
judgment
your
Highness
is
not
entertain
d
with
that
ceremonious
affection
as
you
were
wont
There
s
a
great
abatement
of
kindness
appears
as
well
in
the
general
dependants
as
in
the
Duke
himself
also
and
your

Lear
Ha

me
my

when
I
think
your

wrong
d
Lear
Thou
but
rememb
rest
me
of
mine
own
conception
I
have
perceived
a
most
faint
neglect
of
late
which
I
have
rather
blamed
as
mine
own
jealous
curiosity
than
as
a
very
pretence
and
purpose
of
unkindness
I
will
look
further

But

That

Lear
What

Fool
She

Thou

Lear
No
Fool
Why
to

Torches

Exit
Edgar
Some
blood
drawn
on
me
would
beget
opinion
Of
my
more
fierce
endeavour
Stabs
his
arm
I
have
seen
drunkards
Do
more
than
this
in
sport
Father

Stop

No
help
Enter
Gloucester
and
Servants
with
torches
Glou
Now
Edmund
where
s
the
villain
Edm
Here
stood
he
in
the
dark
his
sharp
sword
out
Mumbling
of
wicked
charms
conjuring
the
moon
To
stand
s
auspicious
mistress
Glou
But
where
is
he
Edm
Look
sir
I
bleed
Glou
Where
is
the
villain
Edmund
Edm
Fled
this
way
sir
When
by
no
means
he
could
Glou
Pursue
him
ho
Go
after
Exeunt
some
Servants
By
no
means
what
Edm
Persuade
me
to
the
murther
of
your
lordship
But
that
I
told
him
the
revenging
gods
Gainst
parricides
did
all
their
thunders
bend
Spoke
with
how
manifold
and
strong
a
bond
The
child
was
bound
to
th
father
sir
in
fine
Seeing
how
loathly
opposite
I
stood
To
his
unnatural
purpose
in
fell
motion
With
his
prepared
sword
he
charges
home
My
unprovided
body
lanch
d
mine
arm
But
when
he
saw
my
best
alarum
d
spirits
Bold
in
the
quarrel
s
right
rous
d
to
th
encounter
Or
whether
gasted
by
the
noise
I
made
Full
suddenly
he
fled
Glou
Let
him
fly
far
Not
in
this
land
shall
he
remain
uncaught
And
found
dispatch
The
noble
Duke
my
master
My
worthy
arch
and
patron
comes
to
night
By
his
authority
I
will
proclaim
it
That
he
which
find
him
shall
deserve
our
thanks
Bringing
the
murderous
caitiff
to
the
stake
He
that
conceals
him
death
Edm
When
I
dissuaded
him
from
his
intent
And
found
him
pight
to
do
it
with
curst
speech
I
threaten
d
to
discover
him
He
replied
Thou
unpossessing
bastard
dost
thou
think
If
I
would
stand
against
thee
would
the
reposal
Of
any
trust
virtue
or
worth
in
thee
Make
thy
words
faith
d
No
What
I
should
deny
As
this
I
would
ay
though
thou
didst
produce
My
very
character
I
ld
turn
it
all
To
thy
suggestion
plot
and
damned
practice
And
thou
must
make
a
dullard
of
the
world
If
they
not
thought
the
profits
of
my
death
Were
very
pregnant
and
potential
spurs
To
make
thee
seek
it
Glou
Strong
and
fast
ned
villain
Would
he
deny
his
letter
I
never
got
him
Tucket

Hark

know
not
why

comes
All

The
Duke
must
grant
me
that
Besides
his
picture
I
will
send
far
and
near
that
all
the
kingdom
May
have
due
note
of
him
