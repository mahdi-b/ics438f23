LADIES

CORNELIUS

Whiles

Make

LADY
I

Exeunt
LADIES
Now
Master
Doctor
have
you
brought
those
drugs
CORNELIUS
Pleaseth
your
Highness
ay
Here
they
are
madam
Presenting
a
box
But
I
beseech
your
Grace
without
offence
My
conscience
bids
me
ask
wherefore
you
have
Commanded
of
me
these
most
poisonous
compounds
Which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
But
though
slow
deadly
QUEEN
I
wonder
Doctor
Thou
ask
st
me
such
a
question
Have
I
not
been
Thy
pupil
long
Hast
thou
not
learn
d
me
how
To
make
perfumes
distil
preserve
yea
so
That
our
great
king
himself
doth
woo
me
oft
For
my
confections
Having
thus
far
proceeded
Unless
thou
think
st
me
devilish
is
t
not
meet
That
I
did
amplify
my
judgment
in
Other
conclusions
I
will
try
the
forces
Of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
We
count
not
worth
the
hanging
but
none
human
To
try
the
vigour
of
them
and
apply
Allayments
to
their
act
and
by
them
gather
Their
several
virtues
and
effects
CORNELIUS
Your
Highness
Shall
from
this
practice
but
make
hard
your
heart
Besides
the
seeing
these
effects
will
be
Both
noisome
and
infectious
QUEEN
O
content
thee
Enter
PISANIO
Aside
Here
comes
a
flattering
rascal
upon

Will
I
first
work
He

An
enemy
to
my

How
now
Pisanio
Doctor
your
service
for
this
time
is
ended
Take
your
own
way
CORNELIUS
Aside
I
do
suspect
you
madam
But
you
shall
do
no
harm
QUEEN
To
PISANIO
Hark
thee
a
word
CORNELIUS
Aside
I
do
not
like
her
She
doth
think
she
has
Strange
ling
ring
poisons
I
do
know
her
spirit
And
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
A
drug
of
such
damn
d
nature
Those
she
has
Will
stupefy
and
dull
the
sense
awhile
Which
first
perchance
she
ll
prove
on
cats
and
dogs
Then
afterward
up
higher
but
there
is
No
danger
in
what
show
of
death
it
makes
More
than
the
locking
up
the
spirits
a
time
To
be
more
fresh
reviving
She
is
fool
d
With
a
most
false
effect
and
I
the
truer
So
to
be
false
with
her
QUEEN
No
further
service
Doctor
Until
I
send
for
thee
CORNELIUS
I
humbly
take
my
leave
Exit
QUEEN
Weeps
she
still
say
st
thou
Dost
thou
think
in

She
will
not
quench
and
let
instructions
enter
Where
folly
now
possesses
Do
thou
work
When
thou
shalt
bring
me
word
she
loves
my
son
I
ll
tell
thee
on
the
instant
thou
art
then
As
great
as
is
thy
master
greater
for
His
fortunes
all
lie
speechless
and
his
name
Is
at
last
gasp
Return
he
cannot

Continue
where
he
is
To
shift
his
being
Is
to
exchange
one
misery
with
another
And
every
day
that
comes
comes
comes
to
A
day
s
work
in
him
What
shalt
thou
expect
To
be
depender
on
a
thing
that
leans
Who
cannot
be
new
built

has
no
friends
So

IMOGEN
When

He
did
incline
to
sadness
and
oft

Not
knowing

IACHIMO
I
never
saw
him
sad
There
is
a
Frenchman

loves
A

Ay

with

It
is
a
recreation
to

And
hear
him
mock
the
Frenchman

Not

Deliver

mine
to

IMOGEN
You
do
seem
to
know
Something
of
me
or
what
concerns
me
pray
you
Since
doubting

go
ill
often
hurts
more
Than
to
be
sure
they
do
for
certainties
Either
are
past
remedies
or
timely
knowing
The
remedy
then
born
discover
to
me
What
both
you
spur
and
stop
IACHIMO
Had
I
this
cheek
To
bathe
my
lips
upon
this
hand
whose
touch
Whose
every
touch
would
force
the
feeler

soul
To
th
oath
of

this
object

Takes

Made

falsehood
falsehood

With

by
peeping

Base
and
illustrious

That

fed

were
fit
That
all

Encounter
such
revolt

Has
forgot

Inclin

His
beastly

Enter
CLOTEN
and
the
two
LORDS
CLOTEN
Was
there
ever
man
had
such
luck
When
I
kiss
d
the
jack
upon
an
up
cast
to
be
hit
away
I
had
a
hundred
pound
on
t
and
then
a
whoreson
jackanapes
must
take
me
up
for
swearing
as
if
I
borrowed
mine
oaths
of
him
and
might
not
spend
them
at
my
pleasure
FIRST
LORD
What
got
he
by
that
You
have
broke
his
pate
with
your
bowl
SECOND
LORD
Aside
If
his
wit
had
been
like
him
that
broke
it
it
would
have
run
all
out
CLOTEN
When
a
gentleman
is
dispos
d
to
swear
it
is
not
for
any
standers
by
to
curtail
his
oaths
Ha
SECOND
LORD
No
my
lord
Aside
nor
crop
the
ears
of
them
CLOTEN
Whoreson
dog
I
give
him
satisfaction
Would
he
had
been
one
of
my
rank
SECOND
LORD
Aside
To
have
smell
d
like
a
fool
CLOTEN
I
am
not
vex
d
more
at
anything
in
th
earth
A
pox
on
t
I
had
rather
not
be
so
noble
as
I
am
they
dare
not
fight
with
me
because
of
the
Queen
my
mother
Every
jackslave
hath
his
bellyful
of
fighting
and
I
must
go
up
and
down
like
a
cock
that
nobody
can
match
SECOND
LORD
Aside
You
are
cock
and
capon
too
and
you
crow
cock
with
your
comb
on
CLOTEN
Sayest
thou
SECOND
LORD
It
is
not
fit
your
lordship
should
undertake
every
companion
that
you
give
offence
to
CLOTEN
No
I
know
that
but
it
is
fit
I
should
commit
offence
to
my
inferiors
SECOND
LORD
Ay
it
is
fit
for
your
lordship
only
CLOTEN
Why
so
I
say
FIRST
LORD
Did
you
hear
of
a
stranger
that
s
come
to
court
to
night
CLOTEN
A
stranger
and
I
not
known
on
t
SECOND
LORD
Aside
He
s
a
strange
fellow
himself
and
knows
it
not
FIRST
LORD
There
s
an
Italian
come
and
tis
thought
one
of
Leonatus
friends
CLOTEN
Leonatus
A
banish
d
rascal
and
he
s
another
whatsoever
he
be
Who
told
you
of
this
stranger
FIRST
LORD
One
of
your
lordship
s
pages
CLOTEN
Is
it
fit
I
went
to
look
upon
him
Is
there
no
derogation
in
t
SECOND
LORD
You
cannot
derogate
my
lord
CLOTEN
Not
easily
I
think
SECOND
LORD
Aside
You
are
a
fool
granted
therefore
your
issues
being
foolish
do
not
derogate
CLOTEN
Come
I
ll
go
see
this
Italian
What
I
have
lost
to
day
at
bowls
I
ll
win
to
night
of
him
Come
go
SECOND
LORD
I
ll
attend
your
lordship
Exeunt
CLOTEN
and
FIRST
LORD
That
such
a
crafty
devil
as
is
his
mother
Should
yield
the
world
this
ass
A
woman
that
Bears
all
down
with
her
brain
and
this
her
son
Cannot
take
two
from
twenty
for
his
heart
And

Alas

what

st
Betwixt

father
by
thy
step

d
A
mother
hourly
coining

wooer
More
hateful
than
the
foul
expulsion

Of
thy

husband

horrid
act
Of
the
divorce

d
make
The
heavens

The

That
