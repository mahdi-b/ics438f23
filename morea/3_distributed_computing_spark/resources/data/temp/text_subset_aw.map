I
am
not
a
slut
though
I
thank
the
gods
I
am
foul
TOUCHSTONE
Well
praised
be
the
gods
for
thy
foulness
sluttishness
may
come
hereafter
But
be
it
as
it
may
be
I
will
marry
thee
and
to
that
end
I
have
been
with
Sir
Oliver
Martext
the
vicar
of
the
next
village
who
hath
promis
d
to
meet
me
in
this
place
of
the
forest
and
to
couple
us
JAQUES
Aside
I
would
fain
see
this
meeting
AUDREY
Well
the
gods
give
us
joy
TOUCHSTONE
Amen
A
man
may
if
he
were
of
a
fearful
heart
stagger
in
this
attempt
for
here
we
have
no
temple
but
the
wood
no
assembly
but
horn
beasts
But
what
though
Courage
As
horns
are
odious
they
are
necessary
It
is
said
Many
a
man
knows
no
end
of
his
goods
Right
Many
a
man
has
good
horns
and
knows
no
end
of
them
Well
that
is
the
dowry
of
his
wife
tis
none
of
his
own
getting
Horns
Even
so
Poor
men
alone
No
no
the
noblest
deer
hath
them
as
huge
as
the
rascal
Is
the
single
man
therefore
blessed
No
as
a
wall
d
town
is
more
worthier
than
a
village
so
is
the
forehead
of
a
married
man
more
honourable
than
the
bare
brow
of
a
bachelor
and
by
how
much
defence
is
better
than
no
skill
by
so
much
is
horn
more
precious
than
to
want
Here
comes
Sir
Oliver
Enter
SIR
OLIVER
MARTEXT
Sir
Oliver
Martext
you
are
well
met
Will
you
dispatch
us
here
under
this
tree
or
shall
we
go
with
you
to
your
chapel
MARTEXT
Is
there
none
here
to
give
the
woman
TOUCHSTONE
I
will
not
take
her
on
gift
of
any
man
MARTEXT
Truly
she
must
be
given
or
the
marriage
is
not
lawful
JAQUES
Discovering
himself
Proceed

I
ll
give
her
TOUCHSTONE
Good
even

Master
What
ye

You

very
well

Goddild

I

Even

Nay

JAQUES
Will

be
married
motley
TOUCHSTONE
As
the
ox
hath
his
bow
sir
the
horse
his
curb
and
the
falcon
her
bells
so
man
hath
his
desires
and
as
pigeons
bill
so
wedlock
would
be
nibbling
JAQUES
And
will
you
being
a
man
of
your
breeding
be
married
under
a
bush
like
a
beggar
Get
you
to
church
and
have
a
good
priest
that
can
tell
you
what
marriage
is
this
fellow
will
but
join
you
together
as
they
join
wainscot
then
one
of
you
will
prove
a
shrunk
panel
and
like
green
timber
warp

TOUCHSTONE
Aside
I
am
not
in
the
mind
but
I
were
better
to
be
married
of
him
than
of
another
for
he
is
not
like
to
marry
me
well
and
not
being
well
married
it
will
be
a
good
excuse
for
me
hereafter
to
leave
my
wife
JAQUES
Go
thou
with
me
and
let
me
counsel
thee
TOUCHSTONE
Come
sweet
Audrey
We
must
be
married
or
we
must
live
in
bawdry
Farewell
good
Master
Oliver
Not
O
sweet
Oliver
O
brave
Oliver
Leave
me
not
behind
thee
But
Wind
away
Begone
I
say
I
will
not
to

with
thee
Exeunt

SCENE
IV
The
forest
Enter
ROSALIND
and
CELIA
ROSALIND
Never
talk
to
me
I
will
weep
CELIA
Do
I
prithee
but
yet
have
the
grace
to
consider
that
tears
do
not
become
a
man
ROSALIND
But
have
I
not
cause
to
weep
CELIA
As
good
cause
as
one
would
desire
therefore
weep
ROSALIND
His
very
hair
is
of
the
dissembling
colour
CELIA
Something
browner
than
Judas
s
Marry
his
kisses
are
Judas
s
own
children
ROSALIND
I
faith
his
hair
is
of
a
good
colour
CELIA
An
excellent
colour
your
chestnut
was
ever
the
only
colour
ROSALIND
And
his
kissing
is
as
full
of
sanctity
as
the
touch
of
holy
bread
CELIA
He
hath
bought
a
pair
of
cast
lips
of
Diana
A
nun
of
winter
s
sisterhood
kisses
not
more
religiously
the
very
ice
of
chastity
is
in
them
ROSALIND
But
why
did
he
swear
he
would
come
this
morning
and
comes
not
CELIA
Nay
certainly
there
is
no
truth
in
him
ROSALIND
Do
you
think
so
CELIA
Yes
I
think
he
is
not
a
pick
purse
nor
a
horse
stealer
but
for
his
verity
in
love
I
do
think
him
as
concave
as
covered
goblet
or
a
worm
eaten
nut
ROSALIND
Not
true
in
love
CELIA
Yes
when
he
is
in
but
I
think
he
is
not
in
ROSALIND
You
have
heard
him
swear
downright
he
was
CELIA
Was
is
not
is
besides
the
oath
of
a
lover
is
no
stronger
than
the
word
of
a
tapster
they
are
both
the
confirmer
of
false
reckonings
He
attends
here
in
the
forest
on
the
Duke
your
father
ROSALIND
I
met
the
Duke
yesterday
and
had
much
question
with
him
He
asked
me
of
what
parentage
I
was
I
told
him
of
as
good
as
he
so
he
laugh
d
and
let
me
go
But
what
talk
we
of
fathers
when
there
is
such
a
man
as
Orlando
CELIA
O
that
s
a
brave
man
He
writes
brave
verses
speaks
brave
words
swears
brave
oaths
and
breaks
them
bravely
quite
traverse
athwart
the
heart
of
his
lover
as
a
puny
tilter
that
spurs
his
horse
but
on
one
side
breaks
his
staff
like
a
noble
goose
But
all
s
brave
that
youth
mounts
and
folly
guides
Who
comes
here
Enter
CORIN
CORIN
Mistress
and
master
you
have
oft
enquired
After
the
shepherd
that
complain
d
of
love
Who
you
saw
sitting
by
me
on
the
turf
Praising
the
proud
disdainful
shepherdess
That
was
his
mistress
CELIA
Well
and
what
of
him
CORIN
If
you
will
see
a
pageant
truly
play
d
Between
the
pale
complexion
of
true
love
And
the
red
glow
of
scorn
and
proud
disdain
Go
hence
a
little
and
I
shall
conduct
you
If
you
will
mark
it
ROSALIND
O
come
let
us
remove
The
sight
of
lovers
feedeth
those
in
love
Bring
us
to
this
sight
and
you
shall
say
I
ll
prove
a
busy
actor
in
their
play
Exeunt
SCENE
V
Another
part
of
the
forest
Enter
SILVIUS
and
PHEBE
SILVIUS
Sweet
Phebe
do
not
scorn
me
do
not
Phebe
Say
that
you
love
me
not
but
say
not
so
In
bitterness
The
common
executioner
Whose
heart
th
accustom
d
sight
of
death
makes
hard
Falls
not
the
axe
upon
the
humbled
neck
But
first
begs
pardon
Will
you
sterner
be
Than
he
that
dies
and
lives
by
bloody
drops
Enter
ROSALIND
CELIA
and
CORIN
at
a
distance
PHEBE
I
would
not
be
thy
executioner
I
fly
thee
for
I
would
not
injure
thee
Thou
tell
st
me
there
is
murder
in
mine
eye
Tis
pretty
sure
and
very
probable
That
eyes
that
are
the
frail
st
and
softest
things
Who
shut
their
coward
gates
on
atomies
Should
be
call
d
tyrants
butchers
murderers
Now
I
do
frown
on
thee
with
all
my
heart
And
if
mine
eyes
can
wound
now
let
them
kill
thee
Now
counterfeit
to
swoon
why
now
fall
down
Or
if
thou
canst
not
O
for
shame
for
shame
Lie
not
to
say
mine
eyes
are
murderers
Now
show
the
wound
mine
eye
hath
made
in
thee
Scratch
thee
but
with
a
pin
and
there
remains
Some
scar
of
it
lean
upon
a
rush
The
cicatrice
and
capable
impressure
Thy
palm
some
moment
keeps
but
now
mine
eyes
Which
I
have
darted
at
thee
hurt
thee
not
Nor
I
am
sure
there
is
not
force
in
eyes
That
can
do
hurt
SILVIUS
O
dear
Phebe
If
ever
as
that
ever
may
be
near
You
meet
in
some
fresh
cheek
the
power
of
fancy
Then
shall
you
know
the
wounds
invisible
That
love
s
keen
arrows
make
PHEBE
But
till
that
time
Come
not
thou
near
me
and
when
that
time
comes
Afflict
me
with
thy
mocks
pity
me
not
As
till
that
time
I
shall
not
pity
thee
ROSALIND
Advancing
And
why
I
pray
you
Who
might
be
your
mother
That
you
insult
exult
and
all
at
once
Over
the
wretched
What
though
you
have
no
beauty
As
by
my
faith
I
see
no
more
in
you
Than
without
candle
may
go
dark
to
bed
Must
you
be
therefore
proud
and
pitiless
Why
what
means
this
Why
do
you
look
on
me
I
see
no
more
in
you
than
in
the
ordinary
Of
nature
s
sale
work
Od
s
my
little
life
I
think
she
means
to
tangle
my
eyes
too
No
faith
proud
mistress
hope
not
after
it
Tis
not
your
inky
brows
your
black
silk
hair
Your
bugle
eyeballs
nor
your
cheek
of
cream
That
can
entame
my
spirits
to
your
worship
You
foolish
shepherd
wherefore
do
you
follow
her
Like
foggy
south
puffing
with
wind
and
rain
You
are
a
thousand
times
a
properer
man
Than
she
a
woman
Tis
such
fools
as
you
That
makes
the
world
full
of
ill
favour
d
children
Tis
not
her
glass
but
you
that
flatters
her
And
out
of
you
she
sees
herself
more
proper
Than
any
of
her
lineaments
can
show
her
But
mistress
know
yourself
Down
on
your
knees
And
thank
heaven
fasting
for
a
good
man
s
love
For
I
must
tell
you
friendly
in
your
ear
Sell
when
you
can
you
are
not
for
all
markets
Cry
the
man
mercy
love
him
take
his
offer
Foul
is
most
foul
being
foul
to
be
a
scoffer
So
take
her
to
thee
shepherd
Fare
you
well
PHEBE
Sweet
youth
I
pray
you
chide
a
year
together
I
had
rather
hear
you
chide
than
this
man
woo
ROSALIND
He
s
fall
n
in
love
with
your
foulness
and
she
ll
fall
in
love
with
my
anger
If
it
be
so
as
fast
as
she
answers
thee
with
frowning
looks
I
ll
sauce
her
with
bitter
words
Why
look
you
so
upon
me
PHEBE
For
no
ill
will
I
bear
you
ROSALIND
I
pray
you
do
not
fall
in
love
with
me
For
I
am
falser
than
vows
made
in
wine
Besides
I
like
you
not
If
you
will
know
my
house
Tis
at
the
tuft
of
olives

Will

Shepherd

Come

Shepherdess

And

None

Come

Sweet
Phebe

Why
I
arn
sorry
for

Silvius
SILVIUS
Wherever
sorrow
is
relief
would
be
If
you
do
sorrow
at
my
grief
in

By
giving
love
your
sorrow
and
my
grief
Were
both
extermin

Thou

not
that
neighbourly
SILVIUS
I
would
have
you
PHEBE
Why
that
were
covetousness
Silvius
the
time
was
that
I
hated
thee
And
yet
it
is
not
that
I
bear
thee
love
But
since
that
thou
canst
talk
of
love
so
well
Thy
company
which
erst
was
irksome
to
me
I
will
endure
and
I
ll
employ
thee
too
But
do
not
look
for
further
recompense
Than
thine
own
gladness
that
thou
art
employ
d
SILVIUS
So
holy
and
so
perfect
is
my
love
And
I
in
such
a
poverty
of
grace
That
I
shall
think
it
a
most
plenteous
crop
To
glean
the
broken
ears
after
the
man
That
the
main
harvest
reaps
loose
now
and
then
A
scatt
red
smile
and
that
I
ll
live
upon
PHEBE
Know
st
thou
the
youth
that
spoke
to
me
erewhile
SILVIUS
Not
very
well
but
I
have
met
him
oft
And
he
hath
bought
the
cottage
and
the
bounds
That
the
old
carlot
once
was
master
of
PHEBE
Think
not
I
love
him
though
I
ask
for
him
Tis
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
But
what
care
I
for
words
Yet
words
do
well
When
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
It
is
a
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
But
sure
he
s
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
He
ll
make
a
proper
man
The
best
thing
in
him
Is
his
complexion
and
faster
than
his
tongue
Did
make
offence
his
eye
did
heal
it
up
He
is
not
very
tall
yet
for
his
years
he
s
tall
His
leg
is
but
so
so
and
yet
tis
well
There
was
a
pretty
redness
in
his
lip
A
little
riper
and
more
lusty
red
Than
that
mix
d
in
his
cheek
twas
just
the
difference
Betwixt
the
constant
red
and
mingled
damask
There
be
some
women
Silvius
had
they
mark
d
him
In
parcels
as
I
did
would
have
gone
near
To
fall
in
love
with
him
but
for
my
part
I
love
him
not
nor
hate
him
not
and
yet
I
have
more
cause
to
hate
him
than
to
love
him
For
what
had
he
to
do
to
chide
at
me
He
said
mine
eyes
were
black
and
my
hair
black
And
now
I
am
rememb
red
scorn
d
at
me
I
marvel
why
I
answer
d
not
again
But
that
s
all
one
omittance
is
no
quittance
I
ll
write
to
him
a
very
taunting
letter
And
thou
shalt
bear
it
wilt
thou
Silvius
SILVIUS
Phebe
with
all
my
heart
PHEBE
I
ll
write
it
straight
The
matter
s
in
my
head
and
in
my
heart
I
will
be
bitter
with
him
and
passing
short
Go
with
me

SCENE

The
forest
Enter
ROSALIND
CELIA
and
JAQUES
JAQUES
I
prithee
pretty
youth
let
me
be
better
acquainted
with
thee
ROSALIND
They
say
you
are
a
melancholy
fellow
JAQUES
I
am
so
I
do
love
it
better
than
laughing
ROSALIND
Those
that
are
in
extremity
of
either
are
abominable
fellows
and
betray
themselves
to
every
modern
censure
worse
than
drunkards
JAQUES
Why
tis
good
to
be
sad
and
say
nothing
ROSALIND
Why
then
tis
good
to
be
a
post
JAQUES
I
have
neither
the
scholar
s
melancholy
which
is
emulation
nor
the
musician
s
which
is
fantastical
nor
the
courtier
s
which
is
proud
nor
the
soldier
s
which
is
ambitious
nor
the
lawyer
s
which
is
politic
nor
the
lady
s
which
is
nice
nor
the
lover
s
which
is
all
these
but
it
is
a
melancholy
of
mine
own
compounded
of
many
simples
extracted
from
many
objects
and
indeed
the
sundry
contemplation
of
my
travels
in
which
my
often
rumination
wraps
me
in
a
most
humorous
sadness
ROSALIND
A
traveller
By
my
faith
you
have
great
reason
to
be
sad
I
fear
you
have
sold
your
own
lands
to
see
other
men
s
then
to
have
seen
much
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
have
rich
eyes
and
poor
hands
JAQUES
Yes
I
have
gain
d
my
experience
Enter
ORLANDO
ROSALIND
And
your
experience
makes
you
sad
I
had
rather
have
a
fool
to
make
me
merry
than
experience
to
make
me
sad
and
to
travel
for
it
too
ORLANDO
Good
day
and
happiness
dear
Rosalind
JAQUES
Nay
then
God
buy
you
an
you
talk
in
blank
verse
ROSALIND
Farewell
Monsieur
Traveller
look
you
lisp
and
wear
strange
suits
disable
all
the
benefits
of
your
own
country
be
out
of
love
with
your
nativity
and
almost
chide
God
for
making
you
that
countenance
you
are
or
I
will
scarce
think
you
have
swam
in
a
gondola
Exit
JAQUES
Why
how
now
Orlando
where
have
you
been
all
this
while
You
a
lover
An
you
serve
me
such
another
trick
never
come
in
my
sight
more
ORLANDO
My
fair
Rosalind
I
come
within
an
hour
of
my
promise
ROSALIND
Break
an
hour
s
promise
in
love
He
that
will
divide
a
minute
into
a
thousand
parts
and
break
but
a
part
of
the
thousand
part
of
a
minute
in
the
affairs
of
love
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
Cupid
hath
clapp
d
him
o
th
shoulder
but
I
ll
warrant
him
heart
whole
ORLANDO
Pardon
me
dear
Rosalind
ROSALIND
Nay
an
you
be
so
tardy
come
no
more
in
my
sight
I
had
as
lief
be
woo
d
of
a
snail
ORLANDO
Of
a
snail
ROSALIND
Ay
of
a
snail
for
though
he
comes
slowly
he
carries
his
house
on
his
head
a
better
jointure
I
think
than
you
make
a
woman
besides
he
brings
his
destiny
with
him
ORLANDO
What
s
that
ROSALIND
Why
horns
which
such
as
you
are
fain
to
be
beholding
to
your
wives
for
but
he
comes
armed
in
his
fortune
and
prevents
the
slander
of
his
wife
ORLANDO
Virtue
is
no
horn
maker
and
my
Rosalind
is
virtuous
ROSALIND
And
I
am
your
Rosalind
CELIA
It
pleases
him
to
call
you
so
but
he
hath
a
Rosalind
of
a
better
leer
than
you
ROSALIND
Come
woo
me
woo
me
for
now
I
am
in
a
holiday
humour
and
like
enough
to
consent
What
would
you
say
to
me
now
an
I
were
your
very
very
Rosalind
ORLANDO
I
would
kiss
before
I
spoke
ROSALIND
Nay
you
were
better
speak
first
and
when
you
were
gravell
d
for
lack
of
matter
you
might
take
occasion
to
kiss
Very
good
orators
when
they
are
out
they
will
spit
and
for
lovers
lacking
God
warn
us
matter
the
cleanliest
shift
is
to
kiss
ORLANDO
How
if
the
kiss
be
denied
ROSALIND
Then
she
puts
you
to
entreaty
and
there
begins
new
matter
ORLANDO
Who
could
be
out
being
before
his
beloved
mistress
ROSALIND
Marry
that
should
you
if
I
were
your
mistress
or
I
should
think
my
honesty
ranker
than
my
wit
ORLANDO
What
of
my
suit
ROSALIND
Not
out
of
your
apparel
and
yet
out
of
your
suit
Am
not
I
your
Rosalind
ORLANDO
I
take
some
joy
to
say
you
are
because
I
would
be
talking
of
her
ROSALIND
Well
in
her
person
I
say
I
will
not
have
you
ORLANDO
Then
in
mine
own
person
I
die
ROSALIND
No
faith
die
by
attorney
The
poor
world
is
almost
six
thousand
years
old
and
in
all
this
time
there
was
not
any
man
died
in
his
own
person
videlicet
in
a
love
cause
Troilus
had
his
brains
dash
d
out
with
a
Grecian
club
yet
he
did
what
he
could
to
die
before
and
he
is
one
of
the
patterns
of
love
Leander
he
would
have
liv
d
many
a
fair
year
though
Hero
had
turn
d
nun
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
hot
midsummer
night
for
good
youth
he
went
but
forth
to
wash
him
in
the
Hellespont
and
being
taken
with
the
cramp
was
drown
d
and
the
foolish
chroniclers
of
that
age
found
it
was
Hero
of
Sestos
But
these
are
all
lies
men
have
died
from
time
to
time
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
ORLANDO
I
would
not
have
my
right
Rosalind
of
this
mind
for
I
protest
her
frown
might
kill
me
ROSALIND
By
this
hand
it
will
not
kill
a
fly
But
come
now
I
will
be
your
Rosalind
in
a
more
coming
on
disposition
and
ask
me
what
you
will
I
will
grant
it
ORLANDO
Then
love
me
Rosalind
ROSALIND
Yes
faith
will
I
Fridays
and
Saturdays
and
all
ORLANDO
And
wilt
thou
have
me
ROSALIND
Ay
and
twenty
such
ORLANDO
What
sayest
thou
ROSALIND
Are
you
not
good
ORLANDO
I
hope
so
ROSALIND
Why
then
can
one
desire
too
much
of
a
good
thing
Come
sister
you
shall
be
the
priest
and
marry
us
Give
me
your
hand
Orlando
What
do
you
say
sister
ORLANDO
Pray
thee
marry
us
CELIA
I
cannot
say
the
words
ROSALIND
You
must
begin
Will
you
Orlando
CELIA
Go
to
Will
you
Orlando
have
to
wife
this
Rosalind
ORLANDO
I
will
ROSALIND
Ay
but
when
ORLANDO
Why
now
as
fast
as
she
can
marry
us
ROSALIND
Then
you
must
say
I
take
thee
Rosalind
for
wife
ORLANDO
I
take
thee
Rosalind
for
wife
ROSALIND
I
might
ask
you
for
your
commission
but
I
do
take
thee
Orlando
for
my
husband
There
s
a
girl
goes
before
the
priest
and
certainly
a
woman
s
thought
runs
before
her
actions
ORLANDO
So
do
all
thoughts
they
are
wing
d
ROSALIND
Now
tell
me
how
long
you
would
have
her
after
you
have
possess
d
her
ORLANDO
For
ever
and
a
day
ROSALIND
Say
a
day
without
the
ever
No
no
Orlando
men
are
April
when
they
woo
December
when
they
wed
maids
are
May
when
they
are
maids
but
the
sky
changes
when
they
are
wives
I
will
be
more
jealous
of
thee
than
a
Barbary
cock
pigeon
over
his
hen
more
clamorous
than
a
parrot
against
rain
more
new
fangled
than
an
ape
more
giddy
in
my
desires
than
a
monkey
I
will
weep
for
nothing
like
Diana
in
the
fountain
and
I
will
do
that
when
you
are
dispos
d
to
be
merry
I
will
laugh
like
a
hyen
and
that
when
thou
are
inclin
d
to
sleep
ORLANDO
But
will
my
Rosalind
do
so
ROSALIND
By
my
life
she
will
do
as
I
do
ORLANDO
O
but
she
is
wise
ROSALIND
Or
else
she
could
not
have
the
wit
to
do
this
The
wiser
the
waywarder
Make
the
doors
upon
a
woman
s
wit
and
it
will
out
at
the
casement
shut
that
and
twill
out
at
the
key
hole
stop
that
twill
fly
with
the
smoke
out
at
the
chimney
ORLANDO
A
man
that
had
a
wife
with
such
a
wit
he
might
say
Wit
whither
wilt
ROSALIND
Nay
you
might
keep
that
check
for
it
till
you
met
your
wife
s
wit
going
to
your
neighbour
s
bed
ORLANDO
And
what
wit
could
wit
have
to
excuse
that
ROSALIND
Marry
to
say
she
came
to
seek
you
there
You
shall
never
take
her
without
her
answer
unless
you
take
her
without
her
tongue
O
that
woman
that
cannot
make
her
fault
her
husband
s
occasion
let
her
never
nurse
her
child
herself
for
she
will
breed
it
like
a
fool
ORLANDO
For
these
two
hours
Rosalind
I
will
leave
thee
ROSALIND
Alas
dear
love
I
cannot
lack
thee
two
hours
ORLANDO
I
must
attend
the
Duke
at
dinner
by
two
o
clock
I
will
be
with
thee
again
ROSALIND
Ay
go
your
ways
go
your
ways
I
knew
what
you
would
prove
my
friends
told
me
as
much
and
I
thought
no
less
That
flattering
tongue
of
yours
won
me
Tis
but
one
cast
away
and
so
come
death
Two
o
clock
is
your
hour
ORLANDO
Ay
sweet
Rosalind
ROSALIND
By
my
troth
and
in
good
earnest
and
so
God
mend
me
and
by
all
pretty
oaths
that
are
not
dangerous
if
you
break
one
jot
of
your
promise
or
come
one
minute
behind
your
hour
I
will
think
you
the
most
pathetical
break
promise
and
the
most
hollow
lover
and
the
most
unworthy
of
her
you
call
Rosalind
that
may
be
chosen
out
of
the
gross
band
of
the
unfaithful
Therefore
beware
my
censure
and
keep
your
promise
ORLANDO
With
no
less
religion
than
if
thou
wert
indeed
my
Rosalind
so
adieu
ROSALIND
Well
Time
is
the
old
justice
that
examines
all
such
offenders
and
let
Time
try
Adieu
Exit
ORLANDO
CELIA
You
have
simply
misus
d
our
sex
in
your
love
prate
We
must
have
your
doublet
and
hose
pluck
d
over
your
head
and
show
the
world
what
the
bird
hath
done
to
her
own
nest
ROSALIND
O
coz
coz
coz
my
pretty
little
coz
that
thou
didst
know
how
many
fathom
deep
I
am
in
love
But
it
cannot
be
sounded
my
affection
hath
an
unknown
bottom
like
the
Bay
of
Portugal
CELIA
Or
rather
bottomless
that
as
fast
as
you
pour
affection
in
it
runs
out
ROSALIND
No
that
same
wicked
bastard
of
Venus
that
was
begot
of
thought
conceiv
d
of
spleen
and
born
of
madness
that
blind
rascally
boy
that
abuses
every
one
s
eyes
because
his
own
are
out
let
him
be
judge
how
deep
I
am
in
love
I
ll
tell
thee
Aliena
I
cannot
be
out
of
the
sight
of
Orlando
I
ll
go
find
a
shadow
and
sigh
till
he
come
CELIA
And
I
ll
sleep
Exeunt

The
forest
Enter
JAQUES
and
LORDS
in
the
habit
of
foresters
JAQUES
Which
is
he
that
killed
the
deer
LORD
Sir
it
was
I
JAQUES
Let
s
present
him
to
the
Duke
like
a
Roman
conqueror
and
it
would
do
well
to
set
the
deer
s
horns
upon
his
head
for
a
branch
of
victory
Have
you
no
song
forester
for
this
purpose
LORD
Yes
sir
JAQUES
Sing
it
tis
no
matter
how
it
be
in
tune
so
it
make
noise
enough
SONG
What
shall
he
have
that
kill
d
the
deer
His
leather
skin
and
horns
to
wear
The
rest
shall
hear
this
burden
Then
sing
him
home
Take
thou
no
scorn
to
wear
the
horn
It
was
a
crest
ere
thou
wast
born
Thy
father
s
father
wore
it
And
thy
father
bore
it
The
horn
the
horn
the
lusty
horn
Is
not
a
thing
to
laugh
to
scorn
Exeunt

The
forest
Enter
ROSALIND
and
CELIA
ROSALIND
How
say
you
now
Is
it
not
past
two
o
clock
And
here
much
Orlando
CELIA
I
warrant
you
with
pure
love
and
troubled
brain
he
hath
ta
en
his
bow
and
arrows
and
is
gone
forth
to
sleep
Look
who
comes
here
Enter
SILVIUS
SILVIUS
My
errand
is
to
you
fair
youth
My
gentle
Phebe
did
bid
me
give
you
this
I
know
not
the
contents
but
as
I
guess
By
the
stern
brow
and
waspish
action
Which
she
did
use
as
she
was
writing
of
it
It
bears
an
angry
tenour
Pardon
me
I
am
but
as
a
guiltless
messenger
ROSALIND
Patience
herself
would
startle
at
this
letter
And
play
the
swaggerer
Bear
this
bear
all
She
says
I
am
not
fair
that
I
lack
manners
She
calls
me
proud
and
that
she
could
not
love
me
