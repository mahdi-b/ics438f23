PAULINA
Sir

Your

much
youth

Not

Fore
your

gazes
Than

I
thought
of

Even
in

I
made
To

SCENE
II
Sicilia
Before
the
palace
of
LEONTES
Enter
AUTOLYCUS
and
a
GENTLEMAN
AUTOLYCUS
Beseech
you
sir
were
you
present
at
this
relation
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
I
was
by
at
the
opening
of
the
fardel
heard
the
old
shepherd
deliver
the
manner
how
he
found
it
whereupon
after
a
little
amazedness
we
were
all
commanded
out
of
the
chamber
only
this
methought
I
heard
the
shepherd
say
he
found
the
child
AUTOLYCUS
I
would
most
gladly
know
the
issue
of
it
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
I
make
a
broken
delivery
of
the
business
but
the
changes
I
perceived
in
the
King
and
Camillo
were
very
notes
of
admiration
They
seem
d
almost
with
staring
on
one
another
to
tear
the
cases
of
their
eyes
there
was
speech
in
their
dumbness
language
in
their
very
gesture
they
look
d
as
they
had
heard
of
a
world
ransom
d
or
one
destroyed
A
notable
passion
of
wonder
appeared
in
them
but
the
wisest
beholder
that
knew
no
more
but
seeing
could
not
say
if
th
importance
were
joy
or
sorrow
but
in
the
extremity
of
the
one
it
must
needs
be
Enter
another
GENTLEMAN
Here
comes
a
gentleman
that
happily
knows
more
The
news
Rogero
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
Nothing
but
bonfires
The
oracle
is
fulfill
d
the
King
s
daughter
is
found
Such
a
deal
of
wonder
is
broken
out
within
this
hour
that
ballad
makers
cannot
be
able
to
express
it
Enter
another
GENTLEMAN
Here
comes
the
Lady
Paulina
s
steward
he
can
deliver
you
more
How
goes
it
now
sir
This
news
which
is
call
d
true
is
so
like
an
old
tale
that
the
verity
of
it
is
in
strong
suspicion
Has
the
King
found
his
heir
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
Most
true
if
ever
truth
were
pregnant
by
circumstance
That
which
you
hear
you
ll
swear
you
see
there
is
such
unity
in
the
proofs
The
mantle
of
Queen
Hermione
s
her
jewel
about
the
neck
of
it
the
letters
of
Antigonus
found
with
it
which
they
know
to
be
his
character
the
majesty
of
the
creature
in
resemblance
of
the
mother
the
affection
of
nobleness
which
nature
shows
above
her
breeding
and
many
other
evidences
proclaim
her
with
all
certainty
to
be
the
King
s
daughter
Did
you
see
the
meeting
of
the
two
kings
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
No
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
Then
you
have
lost
a
sight
which
was
to
be
seen
cannot
be
spoken
of
There
might
you
have
beheld
one
joy
crown
another
so
and
in
such
manner
that
it
seem
d
sorrow
wept
to
take
leave
of
them
for
their
joy
waded
in
tears
There
was
casting
up
of
eyes
holding
up
of
hands
with
countenance
of
such
distraction
that
they
were
to
be
known
by
garment
not
by
favour
Our
king
being
ready
to
leap
out
of
himself
for
joy
of
his
found
daughter
as
if
that
joy
were
now
become
a
loss
cries
O
thy
mother
thy
mother
then
asks
Bohemia
forgiveness
then
embraces
his
son
in
law
then
again
worries
he
his
daughter
with
clipping
her
Now
he
thanks
the
old
shepherd
which
stands
by
like
a
weather
bitten
conduit
of
many
kings
reigns
I
never
heard
of
such
another
encounter
which
lames
report
to
follow
it
and
undoes
description
to
do
it
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
What
pray
you
became
of
Antigonus
that
carried
hence
the
child
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
Like
an
old
tale
still
which
will
have
matter
to
rehearse
though
credit
be
asleep
and
not
an
ear
open
he
was
torn
to
pieces
with
a
bear
This
avouches
the
shepherd
s
son
who
has
not
only
his
innocence
which
seems
much
to
justify
him
but
a
handkerchief
and
rings
of
his
that
Paulina
knows
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
What
became
of
his
bark
and
his
followers
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
Wreck
d
the
same
instant
of
their
master
s
death
and
in
the
view
of
the
shepherd
so
that
all
the
instruments
which
aided
to
expose
the
child
were
even
then
lost
when
it
was
found
But
O
the
noble
combat
that
twixt
joy
and
sorrow
was
fought
in
Paulina
She
had
one
eye
declin
d
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
another
elevated
that
the
oracle
was
fulfill
d
She
lifted
the
Princess
from
the
earth
and
so
locks
her
in
embracing
as
if
she
would
pin
her
to
her
heart
that
she
might
no
more
be
in
danger
of
losing
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
The
dignity
of
this
act
was
worth
the
audience
of
kings
and
princes
for
by
such
was
it
acted
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
One
of
the
prettiest
touches
of
all
and
that
which
angl
d
for
mine
eyes
caught
the
water
though
not
the
fish
was
when
at
the
relation
of
the
Queen
s
death
with
the
manner
how
she
came
to
t
bravely
confess
d
and
lamented
by
the
King
how
attentivenes
wounded
his
daughter
till
from
one
sign
of
dolour
to
another
she
did
with
an
Alas
I
would
fain
say
bleed
tears
for
I
am
sure
my
heart
wept
blood
Who
was
most
marble
there
changed
colour
some
swooned
all
sorrowed
If
all
the
world
could
have
seen
t
the
woe
had
been
universal
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
Are
they
returned
to
the
court
THIRD
GENTLEMAN
No
The
Princess
hearing
of
her
mother
s
statue
which
is
in
the
keeping
of
Paulina
a
piece
many
years
in
doing
and
now
newly
perform
d
by
that
rare
Italian
master
Julio
Romano
who
had
he
himself
eternity
and
could
put
breath
into
his
work
would
beguile
nature
of
her
custom
so
perfectly
he
is
her
ape
He
so
near
to
Hermione
hath
done
Hermione
that
they
say
one
would
speak
to
her
and
stand
in
hope
of
answer
thither
with
all
greediness
of
affection
are
they
gone
and
there
they
intend
to
sup
SECOND
GENTLEMAN
I
thought
she
had
some
great
matter
there
in
hand
for
she
hath
privately
twice
or
thrice
a
day
ever
since
the
death
of
Hermione
visited
that
removed
house
Shall
we
thither
and
with
our
company
piece
the
rejoicing
FIRST
GENTLEMAN
Who
would
be
thence
that
has
the
benefit
of
access
Every
wink
of
an
eye
some
new
grace
will
be
born
Our
absence
makes
us
unthrifty
to
our
knowledge
Let
s
along
Exeunt
GENTLEMEN
AUTOLYCUS
Now
had
I
not
the
dash
of
my
former
life
in
me
would
preferment
drop
on
my
head
I
brought
the
old
man
and
his
son
aboard
the
Prince
told
him
I
heard
them
talk
of
a
fardel
and
I
know
not
what
but
he
at
that
time
over
fond
of
the
shepherd
s
daughter
so
he
then
took
her
to
be
who
began
to
be
much
sea
sick
and
himself
little
better
extremity
of
weather
continuing
this
mystery
remained
undiscover
d
But
tis
all
one
to
me
for
had
I
been
the
finder
out
of
this
secret
it
would
not
have
relish
d
among
my
other
discredits
Enter
SHEPHERD
and
CLOWN
Here
come
those
I
have
done
good
to
against
my
will
and
already
appearing
in
the
blossoms
of
their
fortune
SHEPHERD
Come
boy
I
am
past
moe
children
but
thy
sons
and
daughters
will
be
all
gentlemen
born
CLOWN
You
are
well
met
sir
You
denied
to
fight
with
me
this
other
day
because
I
was
no
gentleman
born
See
you
these
clothes
Say
you
see
them
not
and
think
me
still
no
gentleman
born
You
were
best
say
these
robes
are
not
gentlemen
born
Give
me
the
lie
do
and
try
whether
I
am
not
now
a
gentleman
born
AUTOLYCUS
I
know
you
are
now

a
gentleman
born
CLOWN
Ay

four
hours

Prince

brother
and
the
Princess

And
so
we
wept
and
there
was
the
first
gentleman
like
tears
that
ever
we
shed
SHEPHERD
We
may
live
son
to
shed
many
more

LORDS

LEONTES
O
grave
and
good
Paulina
the
great
comfort
That
I
have
had
of
thee
PAULINA
What
sovereign
sir
I
did
not
well
I
meant
well
All
my
services
You
have
paid
home
but
that
you
have
vouchsaf
d
With
your
crown
d
brother
and
these
your
contracted
Heirs
of
your
kingdoms
my
poor
house
to
visit
It
is
a
surplus
of
your
grace
which
never
My
life
may
last
to
answer
LEONTES
O
Paulina
We
honour
you
with
trouble
but
we
came
To
see
the
statue
of
our
queen
Your
gallery
Have
we
pass
d
through
not
without
much
content
In
many
singularities
but
we
saw
not
That
which
my
daughter
came
to
look
upon
The
statue
of
her
mother
PAULINA
As
she
liv
d
peerless
So
her
dead
likeness
I
do
well
believe
Excels
whatever
yet
you
look
d
upon
Or
hand
of
man
hath
done
therefore
I
keep
it
Lonely
apart
But
here
it
is
Prepare
To
see
the
life
as
lively
mock
d
as
ever
Still
sleep
mock
d
death
Behold
and
say
tis
well
PAULINA
draws
a
curtain
and
discovers
HERMIONE
standing
like
a
statue
I
like
your
silence
it
the
more
shows
off
Your
wonder
but
yet
speak
First
you
my
liege
Comes
it
not
something
near
LEONTES
Her
natural
posture
Chide
me
dear
stone
that
I
may
say
indeed
Thou
art
Hermione
or
rather
thou
art
she
In
thy
not
chiding
for
she
was
as
tender
As
infancy
and
grace
But
yet
Paulina
Hermione
was
not
so
much
wrinkled
nothing
So
aged
as
this
seems
POLIXENES
O
not
by
much
PAULINA
So
much
the
more
our
carver
s
excellence
Which
lets
go
by
some
sixteen
years
and
makes
her
As
she
liv
d
now
LEONTES
As
now
she
might
have
done
So
much
to
my
good
comfort
as
it
is
Now
piercing
to
my
soul
O
thus
she
stood
Even
with
such
life
of
majesty
warm
life
As
now
it
coldly
stands
when
first
I
woo
d
her
I
am
asham
d
Does
not
the
stone
rebuke
me
For
being
more
stone
than
it
O
royal
piece
There
s
magic
in
thy
majesty
which
has
My
evils
conjur
d
to
remembrance
and
From
thy
admiring
daughter
took
the
spirits
Standing
like
stone
with
thee
PERDITA
And
give
me
leave
And
do
not
say
tis
superstition
that
I
kneel
and
then
implore
her
blessing
Lady
Dear
queen
that
ended
when
I
but
began
Give
me
that
hand
of
yours
to
kiss
PAULINA
O
patience
The
statue
is
but
newly
fix
d
the
colour
s
Not
dry
CAMILLO
My
lord
your
sorrow
was
too
sore
laid
on
Which
sixteen
winters
cannot
blow
away
So
many
summers
dry
Scarce
any
joy
Did
ever
so
long
live
no
sorrow
But
kill
d
itself
much
sooner
POLIXENES
Dear
my
brother
Let
him
that
was
the
cause
of
this
have
pow
r
To
take
off
so
much
grief
from
you
as
he
Will
piece
up
in
himself
PAULINA
Indeed
my
lord
If
I
had
thought
the
sight
of
my
poor
image
Would
thus
have
wrought
you
for
the
stone
is
mine
I
d
not
have
show
d
it
LEONTES
Do
not
draw
the
curtain
PAULINA
No
longer
shall
you
gaze
on
t
lest
your
fancy
May
think
anon
it
moves
LEONTES
Let
be
let
be
Would
I
were
dead
but
that
methinks
already
What
was
he
that
did
make
it
See
my
lord
Would
you
not
deem
it
breath
d
and
that
those
veins
Did
verily
bear
blood
POLIXENES
Masterly
done
The
very
life
seems
warm
upon
her
lip
LEONTES
The
fixture
of
her
eye
has
motion
in
t
As
we
are
mock
d
with
art
PAULINA
I
ll
draw
the
curtain
My
lord
s
almost
so
far
transported
that
He
ll
think
anon
it
lives
LEONTES
O
sweet
Paulina
Make
me
to
think
so
twenty
years
together
No
settled
senses
of
the
world
can
match
The
pleasure
of
that
madness
Let
t
alone
PAULINA
I
am
sorry
sir
I
have
thus
far
stirr
d
you
but
I
could
afflict
you
farther
LEONTES
Do
Paulina
For
this
affliction
has
a
taste
as
sweet
As
any
cordial
comfort
Still
methinks
There
is
an
air
comes
from
her
What
fine
chisel
Could
ever
yet
cut
breath
Let
no
man
mock
me
For
I
will
kiss
her
PAULINA
Good
my
lord
forbear
The
ruddiness
upon
her
lip
is
wet
You
ll
mar
it
if
you
kiss
it
stain
your
own
With
oily
painting
Shall
I
draw
the
curtain
LEONTES
No
not
these
twenty
years
PERDITA
So
long
could
I
Stand
by
a
looker
on
PAULINA
Either
forbear
Quit
presently
the
chapel
or
resolve
you
For
more
amazement
If
you
can
behold
it
I
ll
make
the
statue
move
indeed
descend
And
take
you
by
the
hand
but
then
you
ll
think
Which
I
protest
against
I
am
assisted
By
wicked
powers
LEONTES
What
you
can
make
her
do
I
am
content
to
look
on
what
to
speak
I
am
content
to
hear
for
tis
as
easy
To
make
her
speak
as
move
PAULINA
It
is
requir
d
You
do
awake
your
faith
Then
all
stand
still
Or
those
that
think
it
is
unlawful
business
I
am
about
let
them
depart
LEONTES
Proceed
No
foot
shall
stir
PAULINA
Music
awake
her
strike
Music
Tis
time
descend
be
stone
no
more
approach
Strike
all
that
look
upon
with
marvel
Come
I
ll
fill
your
grave
up
Stir
nay
come
away
Bequeath
to
death
your
numbness
for
from
him
Dear
life
redeems
you
You
perceive
she
stirs
HERMIONE
comes
down
from
the
pedestal
Start
not
her
actions
shall
be
holy
as
You
hear
my
spell
is
lawful
Do
not
shun
her
Until
you
see
her
die
again
for
then
You
kill
her
double
Nay
present
your
hand
When
she
was
young
you
woo
d
her
now
in
age
Is
she
become
the
suitor
LEONTES
O
she
s
warm
If
this
be
magic
let
it
be
an
art
Lawful
as
eating
POLIXENES
She
embraces
him
CAMILLO
She
hangs
about
his
neck
If
she
pertain
to
life
let
her
speak
too
POLIXENES
Ay
and
make
it
manifest
where
she
has
liv
d
Or
how
stol
n
from
the
dead
PAULINA
That
she
is
living
Were
it
but
told
you
should
be
hooted
at
Like
an
old
tale
but
it
appears
she
lives
Though
yet
she
speak
not
Mark
a
little
while
Please
you
to
interpose
fair
madam
Kneel
And
pray
your
mother
s
blessing
Turn
good
lady
Our
Perdita

HERMIONE
You
gods
look
down
And
from
your
sacred
vials
pour
your
graces
Upon
my
daughter
s
head
Tell
me
mine
own
Where
hast
thou
been

How

Thy
father

For
thou
shalt
hear
that
I
Knowing
by
Paulina
that
the
oracle
Gave
hope
thou
wast
in
being
have
preserv
d
Myself
to
see
the
issue
PAULINA
There
s
time
enough
for
that
Lest
they
desire
upon
this
push
to
trouble
Your
joys
with
like
relation
Go
together
You
precious
winners
all
your
exultation
Partake

I
an
old
turtle
Will
wing

to
some
wither

bough

there
My
mate

Lament

I
am
lost
LEONTES
O
peace
Paulina
Thou
shouldst
a
husband
take
by
my
consent
As
I
by
thine
a
wife
This
is
a
match
And
made
between
s
by
vows
Thou
hast
found
mine
But
how
is
to
be
question
d
for
I
saw
her
As
I
thought
dead
and
have
in
vain
said
many
A
prayer
upon
her
grave
I
ll
not
seek
far
For
him
I
partly
know
his
mind
to
find
thee
An
honourable
husband
Come
Camillo
And
take
her
by
the
hand
whose
worth
and
honesty
Is
richly
noted

justified
By
