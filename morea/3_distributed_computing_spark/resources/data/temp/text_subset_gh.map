As

shortens
four

I
reap
thereby
For

hath
to
spend
Can
change
their
moons
and
bring
their
times
about
My
oil
dried
lamp
and

bewasted
light
Shall
be
extinct
with
age

blindfold
death
not
let

Why

thou

many

to

GAUNT
But
not

King
that
thou
canst
give
Shorten
my

with
sullen
sorrow
And
pluck
nights
from
me
but
not
lend
a
morrow
Thou
can
st
help
time
to
furrow
me
with
age
But
stop
no

in
his

Thy
word

Thy

Things

You

I

You

have
bid
me

like

O
had
it
been
a
stranger
not
my
child
To
smooth
his
fault
I
should
have

to
avoid
And

Alas
I
look
d
when
some
of
you
should
say
I

But

Against

As

O
to
what

dost
thou
hoard
thy
words
That
thou
returnest
no
greeting
to
thy
friends
BOLINGBROKE
I
have
too
few
to

my
leave
of
you
When
the
tongue

should
be
prodigal
To
breathe
the
abundant
dolour
of

GAUNT
Thy
grief
is
but
thy
absence

BOLINGBROKE
Joy

What

Call
it
a

BOLINGBROKE
My
heart
will
sigh
when
I
miscall
it
so
Which
finds
it
an
enforced
pilgrimage

The

thy
weary
steps
Esteem

wherein
thou
art
to
set
The
precious
jewel
of
thy
home

BOLINGBROKE
Nay
rather
every
tedious
stride
I
make
Will
but
remember
me
what
a
deal
of
world
I
wander
from
the
jewels
that
I
love
Must
I
not
serve
a
long
apprenticehood
To
foreign
passages
and
in
the
end
Having
my
freedom
boast
of
nothing
else
But
that
I
was
a
journeyman
to
grief
GAUNT
All
places
that
the
eye
of

visits
Are
to
a
wise
man
ports
and
happy
havens
Teach
thy
necessity
to
reason
thus
There
is
no
virtue
like
necessity
Think
not
the
King
did
banish
thee
But
thou
the
King
Woe
doth
the
heavier
sit
Where
it
perceives
it
is
but
faintly
home
Go
say
I
sent
thee
forth
to
purchase
honour
And
not

King
exil
d
thee
or
suppose
Devouring

And
thou

To

The

For
gnarling
sorrow

less

The
man
that
mocks
at
it
and
sets

BOLINGBROKE
O
who
can
hold
a
fire
in
his

By

on

frosty
Caucasus
Or
cloy

edge
of

By

Or

Gives

KING
RICHARD
We
did
observe
Cousin
Aumerle
How
far
brought
you
high
Hereford
on
his
way
AUMERLE
I
brought
high
Hereford
if
you
call
him
so
But
to
the
next
high
way
and
there
I
left
him
KING
RICHARD
And
say
what
store
of
parting
tears
were
shed
AUMERLE
Faith
none
for
me
except
the
north
east
wind
Which
then
blew
bitterly
against
our
faces
Awak
d
the
sleeping
rheum
and
so
by
chance
Did
grace
our
hollow
parting
with
a
tear
KING
RICHARD
What
said
our
cousin
when
you
parted
with
him
AUMERLE
Farewell
And
for
my
heart
disdained
that
my
tongue
Should
so
profane
the
word
that
taught
me
craft
To
counterfeit
oppression
of
such
grief
That
words
seem
d
buried
in
my
sorrow
s
grave
Marry
would
the
word
farewell
have
length
ned
hours
And
added
years
to
his
short
banishment
He
should
have
had
a
volume
of
farewells
But
since
it
would
not
he
had
none
of
me
KING
RICHARD
He
is
our
cousin
cousin
but
tis
doubt
When
time
shall
call
him
home
from
banishment
Whether
our
kinsman
come
to
see
his
friends
Ourself
and
Bushy
Bagot
here
and
Green
Observ
d
his
courtship
to
the
common
people
How
he
did
seem
to
dive
into
their
hearts
With
humble
and
familiar
courtesy
What
reverence
he
did
throw
away
on
slaves
Wooing
poor
craftsmen
with
the
craft
of
smiles
And
patient
underbearing
of
his
fortune
As
twere
to
banish
their
affects
with
him
Off
goes
his
bonnet
to
an
oyster
wench
A
brace
of
draymen
bid
God
speed
him
well
And
had
the
tribute
of
his
supple
knee
With
Thanks
my
countrymen
my
loving
friends
As
were
our
England
in
reversion
his
And
he
our
subjects
next
degree
in
hope
GREEN
Well
he
is
gone
and
with
him
go
these
thoughts
Now
for
the
rebels
which
stand
out
in
Ireland
Expedient
manage
must
be
made
my
liege
Ere
further
leisure
yicld
them
further
means
For
their
advantage
and
your
Highness
loss
KING
RICHARD
We
will
ourself
in
person
to
this
war
And
for
our
coffers
with
too
great
a
court
And
liberal
largess

grown
somewhat
light
We
are
enforc
d
to
farm
our
royal
realm
The
revenue
whereof
shall
furnish
us
For
our
affairs
in
hand
If
that
come
short
Our
substitutes
at
home
shall
have
blank
charters
Whereto
when
they
shall
know
what
men
are
rich
They
shall
subscribe
them
for
large
sums
of
gold
And
send
them

to
supply
our
wants
For

will
make
for

JOHN
OF
GAUNT
sick
with
the
DUKE
OF
YORK
etc
GAUNT
Will
the
King
come
that
I
may
breathe
my
last
In
wholesome
counsel
to
his
unstaid
youth
YORK
Vex
not
yourself
nor
strive
not
with
your
breath
For
all
in
vain
comes
counsel
to
his
ear
GAUNT
O
but
they
say
the
tongues
of
dying
men
Enforce
attention
like
deep
harmony
Where
words
are
scarce
they
are
seldom
spent
in
vain
For
they
breathe
truth
that
breathe
their
words
in
pain
He
that
no
more
must
say
is
listen
d
more
Than
they
whom
youth
and
ease
have
taught
to
glose
More
are
men
s
ends
mark
d
than
their
lives
before
The
setting
sun
and
music
at
the
close
As
the
last
taste
of
sweets
is
sweetest
last
Writ
in
remembrance
more
than
things
long
past
Though
Richard
my
life
s
counsel
would
not
hear
My
death
s
sad
tale
may
yet
undeaf
his
ear
YORK
No
it
is
stopp
d
with
other
flattering
sounds
As
praises
of
whose
taste
the
wise
are
fond
Lascivious
metres
to
whose
venom
sound
The
open
ear
of
youth
doth
always
listen
Report
of
fashions
in
proud
Italy
Whose
manners
still
our
tardy
apish
nation
Limps
after
in
base
imitation
Where
doth
the
world
thrust
forth
a
vanity
So
it
be
new
there
s
no
respect
how
vile
That
is
not
quickly
buzz
d
into
his
ears
Then
all
too
late
comes
counsel
to
be
heard
Where
will
doth
mutiny
with
wit
s
regard
Direct
not
him
whose
way
himself
will
choose
Tis
breath
thou
lack
st
and
that
breath
wilt
thou
lose
GAUNT
Methinks
I
am
a
prophet
new
inspir
d
And
thus
expiring
do
foretell
of
him
His
rash
fierce
blaze
of
riot
cannot
last
For
violent
fires
soon
burn
out
themselves
Small
showers
last
long
but
sudden
storms
are
short
He
tires
betimes
that
spurs
too
fast
betimes
With
eager
feeding
food
doth
choke
the
feeder
Light
vanity
insatiate
cormorant
Consuming
means
soon
preys
upon
itself
This
royal
throne
of
kings
this
scept
red
isle
This
earth
of
majesty
this
seat
of
Mars
This
other
Eden
demi
paradise
This
fortress
built
by
Nature
for
herself
Against
infection
and
the
hand
of
war
This
happy
breed
of
men
this
little
world
This
precious
stone
set
in
the
silver
sea
Which
serves
it
in
the
office
of
a
wall
Or
as
a
moat
defensive
to
a
house
Against
the
envy
of
less
happier
lands
This
blessed
plot
this
earth
this
realm
this
England
This
nurse
this
teeming
womb
of
royal
kings
Fear
d
by
their
breed
and
famous
by
their
birth
Renowned
for
their
deeds
as
far
from
home
For
Christian
service
and
true
chivalry
As
is
the
sepulchre
in
stubborn
Jewry
Of
the
world
s
ransom
blessed
Mary
s
Son
This
land
of
such
dear
souls
this
dear
dear
land
Dear
for
her
reputation
through
the
world
Is
now
leas
d
out
I
die
pronouncing
it
Like
to
a
tenement
or
pelting
farm
England
bound
in
with
the
triumphant
sea
Whose
rocky
shore
beats
back
the
envious
siege
Of
wat
ry
Neptune
is
now
bound
in
with
shame
With
inky
blots
and
rotten
parchment
bonds
That
England
that
was
wont
to
conquer
others
Hath
made
a
shameful
conquest
of
itself
Ah
would
the
scandal
vanish
with
my
life
How
happy
then
were
my
ensuing
death

KING

What

GAUNT
O
how
that
name
befits
my
composition
Old
Gaunt
indeed
and
gaunt
in
being
old
Within
me
grief
hath
kept
a
tedious
fast
And
who
abstains
from
meat
that
is
not
gaunt
For
sleeping
England
long

I

Watching

leanness

The
pleasure

some

Is

I

And
therein

Gaunt

KING
RICHARD
Can
sick
men
play
so
nicely
with
their
names
GAUNT
No
misery
makes
sport
to
mock
itself
Since
thou
dost
seek
to
kill
my
name
in
me
I
mock
my
name
great
king
to
flatter
thee
KING

Should
dying

flatter

GAUNT
No
no

Thou

GAUNT
Now
He

Ill

Thy

no
lesser

Wherein

sick
And

careless
patient
