DUCHESS
My

you
would
tell

When
weeping
made
you
break
the
story
off
Of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
London
YORK
Where
did
I
leave
DUCHESS
At
that
sad
stop
my
lord
Where
rude
misgoverned
hands
from
windows
tops
Threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
King
Richard
s
head
YORK
Then

I
said
the
Duke
great
Bolingbroke
Mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
Which
his
aspiring
rider
seem
d
to
know
With
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
Whilst
all
tongues
cried
God
save
thee
Bolingbroke
You
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
So
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
Through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
Upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
With
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
Jesu
preserve
thee
Welcome
Bolingbroke
Whilst

Bareheaded

Thinking
his
prattle

Even
so

with
much
more
contempt
men

eyes
Did
scowl
on
gentle
Richard
no
man
cried
God
save
him
No
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
But
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
Which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
His
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
The
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
That
had
not
God
for
some
strong
purpose
steel
d
The
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
And
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him
But

hath
a
hand
in

To

high

And
beat
our
watch

passengers
Which

young
wanton
and
effeminate
boy
Takes
on
the
point
of
honour
to
support
So
dissolute
a
crew
PERCY
My
lord
some
two
days
since
I
saw
the
Prince
And
told
him
of
those
triumphs
held
at
Oxford
BOLINGBROKE
And
what
said
the
gallant
PERCY
His
answer
was
he
would
unto
the
stews
And
from
the
common
st
creature
pluck
a
glove
And
wear
it
as
a
favour
and
with
that
He
would
unhorse
the
lustiest
challenger
BOLINGBROKE
As
dissolute
as
desperate
yet
through
both
I
see
some
sparks
of
better
hope
which
elder
years
May
happily
bring
forth
But
who
comes
here
Enter
AUMERLE
amazed
AUMERLE
Where
is
the
King
BOLINGBROKE
What
means
our
cousin
that
he
stares
and
looks
So
wildly
AUMERLE
God
save
your
Grace
I
do
beseech
your
Majesty
To
have
some
conference
with
your
Grace
alone
BOLINGBROKE
Withdraw
yourselves
and
leave
us
here
alone
Exeunt
PERCY

LORDS
What
is
the
matter
with
our

now
AUMERLE
For
ever
may
my
knees
grow
to

earth
Kneels
My
tongue
cleave
to
my
roof
within
my
mouth
Unless
a
pardon
ere
I
rise
or
speak
BOLINGBROKE
Intended
or
committed
was
this
fault
If
on
the
first
how
heinous
e
er
it
be
To
win
thy
after
love
I
pardon
thee
AUMERLE
Then
give
me
leave
that
I
may
turn
the
key
That
no
man
enter
till
my
tale
be
done
BOLINGBROKE
Have
thy
desire
The
DUKE
OF

knocks

Within
My

look
to

Thou

a
traitor
in

BOLINGBROKE
What

Speak
Recover

That

to
encounter
it
YORK
Peruse
this
writing
here
and
thou
shalt
know
The
treason
that
my
haste
forbids
me

AUMERLE
Remember

thou
read

thy
promise

I
do
repent
me
read
not
my
name

My
heart
is
not

YORK
It
was
villain
ere
thy
hand
did
set
it
down
I
tore
it
from
the
traitor

bosom
King
Fear
and
not
love
begets
his
penitence
Forget

pity
him
lest
thy
pity
prove
A
serpent
that

sting
thee
to
the
heart
BOLINGBROKE
O
heinous
strong

conspiracy
O
loyal

of
a
treacherous

Thou

From
whence
this

through
muddy

Hath
held
his
current

defil
d

Thy
overflow
of
good
converts
to
bad
And
thy
abundant
goodness
shall
excuse
This
deadly
blot
in
thy
digressing
son
YORK
So
shall
my
virtue
be
his
vice
s
bawd
And
he
shall
spend
mine
honour
with
his
shame
As
thriftless

Mine

Or

For

DUCHESS
Pleads
he
in

Look
upon
his

His
eyes
do
drop
no
tears
his
prayers
are
in
jest
His
words
come
from
his
mouth
ours
from
our
breast
He
prays
but
faintly
and
would
be
denied
We
pray
with
heart
and
soul
and
all
beside
His
weary
joints
would
gladly
rise
I
know
Our
knees
still
kneel
till
to
the
ground
they
grow
His
prayers
are
full
of
false
hypocrisy
Ours
of
true
zeal
and
deep
integrity
Our
prayers
do

pray

let

That

Say

No

Speak
it

pardonne

DUCHESS
Dost

pardon
pardon

Ah
my
sour
husband
my
hard
hearted
lord
That
sets
the
word
itself

Speak

current

The

French

Thine
eye
begins

set
thy
tongue
there
Or
in
thy
piteous
heart
plant
thou
thine
ear
That
hearing
how
our
plaints

prayers
do
pierce
Pity
may
move
thee
pardon

rehearse
BOLINGBROKE

Pardon

God

DUCHESS
O
happy
vantage
of
a
kneeling
knee
Yet
am
I
sick
for
fear
Speak
it
again
Twice
saying
pardon
doth
not
pardon

But
makes
one
pardon
strong
BOLINGBROKE
With
all
my
heart
I
pardon
him
DUCHESS
A
god

art

With
