Thy

CORIOLANUS
My
name
is
Caius
Marcius
who
hath
done
To
thee
particularly
and
to
all
the
Volsces
Great
hurt
and
mischief
thereto
witness
may
My
surname
Coriolanus
The
painful
service
The
extreme
dangers
and
the
drops
of
blood
Shed
for
my
thankless
country
are
requited
But
with
that
surname
a
good
memory
And
witness
of
the
malice
and
displeasure
Which
thou
shouldst
bear
me
Only
that
name
remains
The
cruelty
and
envy
of
the
people
Permitted
by
our
dastard
nobles
who
Have
all
forsook

An
suffer

Now
this
extremity
Hath
brought
me
to
thy
hearth
not
out
of
hope
Mistake
me
not
to

my
life
for
if
I
had
fear
d
death
of
all
the
men
i
th
world
I
would
have
voided
thee
but
in
mere
spite
To
be
full
quit
of
those
my
banishers
Stand
I
before
thee
here
Then
if
thou
hast
A
heart
of
wreak
in
thee
that
wilt
revenge
Thine
own
particular
wrongs
and
stop
those
maims
Of
shame
seen
through
thy
country
speed
thee
straight
And
make
my
misery
serve
thy
turn
So
use
it
That
my
revengeful
services
may
prove
As
benefits
to
thee
for
I
will
fight
Against
my
cank
red
country
with
the
spleen
Of
all
the
under
fiends
But

Th

I

Longer
to

most
weary
and
present
My
throat
to
thee
and
to
thy
ancient
malice
Which
not
to
cut
would
show
thee
but
a
fool
Since
I
have
ever
followed
thee
with
hate
Drawn
tuns
of
blood
out
of
thy
country
s
breast
And
cannot
live
but
to
thy
shame
unless
It
be
to
do
thee
service
AUFIDIUS
O
Marcius
Marcius
Each
word
thou
hast
spoke
hath
weeded
from
my
heart
A
root
of
ancient
envy
If
Jupiter
Should
from
yond
cloud
speak
divine
things
And
say
Tis
true
I
d
not
believe
them
more
Than
thee
all
noble
Marcius
Let
me
twine
Mine
arms
about
that
body
where
against
My
grained
ash
an
hundred
times
hath
broke
And
scarr
d
the
moon
with
splinters
here
I
clip
The
anvil
of
my
sword
and
do
contest
As
hotly
and
as
nobly
with
thy
love
As
ever
in
ambitious
strength
I
did
Contend
against
thy
valour
Know
thou
first
I
lov
d
the
maid
I
married
never
man
Sigh
d
truer
breath
but
that
I
see
thee
here
Thou
noble
thing
more
dances
my
rapt
heart
Than
when
I
first
my
wedded
mistress
saw
Bestride
my
threshold
Why
thou
Mars
I
tell
the
We
have
a
power
on
foot
and
I
had
purpose
Once
more
to
hew
thy
target
from
thy
brawn
Or

Thou
hast
beat
me
out
Twelve
several
times
and
I
have
nightly
since
Dreamt
of
encounters
twixt
thyself
and
me
We
have
been
down
together
in
my
sleep
Unbuckling
helms
fisting

throat
And
wak
d
half
dead
with
nothing
Worthy
Marcius
Had
we
no
other
quarrel

Rome
but
that
Thou

would
muster
all
From

to

Into
the
bowels
of

Rome
Like

O

And

Who

Who

Therefore

have
The
leading
of
thine

Th
one
half
of

set
down
As
best
thou
art
experienc
d
since
thou
know
st
Thy
country
s
strength
and
weakness
thine
own
ways
Whether
to
knock
against
the
gates
of
Rome
Or
rudely
visit
them
in
parts
remote
To
fright
them
ere
destroy
But
come

Let
me
commend
thee
first
to
those
that
shall
Say
yea
to
thy
desires
A
thousand

Your

Exeunt
CORIOLANUS

AUFIDIUS
The
two
SERVINGMEN
come
forward
FIRST
SERVANT
Here
s
a
strange
alteration
SECOND
SERVANT
By
my
hand
I
had
thought
to
have
strucken
him
with
a
cudgel
and
yet
my
mind
gave
me
his
clothes
made
a
false
report
of
him
FIRST
SERVANT
What
an
arm
he
has
He
turn
d
me
about
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
as
one
would
set
up
a
top
SECOND
SERVANT
Nay
I
knew
by
his
face
that
there
was
something
in
him
he
had
sir
a
kind
of
face
methought
I
cannot
tell
how
to
term
it
FIRST
SERVANT
He
had
so
looking
as
it
were
Would
I
were
hang
d
but
I
thought
there
was
more
in
him
than
I
could
think
SECOND
SERVANT
So
did
I
I
ll
be
sworn
He
is
simply
the
rarest
man
i
th
world
FIRST
SERVANT
I
think
he
is
but
a
greater
soldier
than
he
you
wot
on
SECOND
SERVANT
Who
my
master
FIRST
SERVANT
Nay
it
s
no
matter
for
that
SECOND
SERVANT
Worth
six
on
him
FIRST
SERVANT
Nay
not
so
neither
but
I
take
him
to
be
the
greater
soldier
SECOND
SERVANT
Faith
look
you
one
cannot
tell
how
to
say
that
for
the
defence
of
a
town
our
general
is
excellent

SERVANT

an
assault
too
Re
