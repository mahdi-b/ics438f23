You

He
that

For

In

seen
small
reflection
of

She
shines
not
upon

lest
the
reflection
should
hurt
her
CLOTEN
Come
I

to

chamber
Would
there
had

It
was
his
queen
his
queen
IMOGEN
Then
wav
d
his
handkerchief
PISANIO
And
kiss
d
it
madam
IMOGEN
Senseless
linen
happier
therein
than
I
And
that
was
all
PISANIO
No
madam
for
so
long
As
he
could
make
me
with
his
eye
or
care
Distinguish
him
from
others
he
did
keep
The
deck
with
glove
or
hat
or
handkerchief
Still
waving
as
the
fits
and
stirs
of
s
mind
Could
best
express
how
slow
his
soul
sail
d
on
How
swift
his
ship
IMOGEN
Thou
shouldst
have
made
him
As
little
as
a
crow
or
less
ere
left
To
after
eye
him
PISANIO
Madam
so
I
did
IMOGEN
I
would
have
broke
mine
eyestrings
crack
d
them
but
To
look
upon
him
till
the
diminution
Of
space
had
pointed
him
sharp
as
my
needle
Nay
followed
him
till
he
had
melted
from
The
smallness
of
a
gnat
to
air
and
then
Have
turn
d
mine
eye
and
wept
But
good
Pisanio
When
shall
we
hear
from
him
PISANIO
Be
assur
d
madam
With
his
next
vantage
IMOGEN
I
did
not
take
my
leave
of
him
but
had
Most
pretty
things
to
say
Ere
I
could
tell
him
How
I
would
think
on
him
at
certain
hours
Such
thoughts
and
such
or
I
could
make
him
swear
The
shes
of
Italy
should
not
betray
Mine
interest
and
his
honour
or
have
charg
d
him
At
the
sixth
hour
of
morn
at
noon
at
midnight
T
encounter
me
with
orisons
for
then
I
am
in
heaven
for
him
or
ere
I
could
Give
him
that
parting
kiss
which
I
had
set
Betwixt
two
charming
words
comes
in
my
father
And
like
the
tyrannous
breathing
of
the
north
Shakes
all
our
buds
from

Enter

SCENE
IV
Rome
PHILARIO
S
house
Enter
PHILARIO
IACHIMO
a
FRENCHMAN
a
DUTCHMAN
and
a
SPANIARD
IACHIMO
Believe
it
sir
I
have
seen
him
in
Britain
He
was
then
of
a
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
But
I
could
then
have
look
d
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
I
to
peruse
him
by
items
PHILARIO
You
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnish
d
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without
and
within
FRENCHMAN
I
have
seen
him
in
France
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
IACHIMO
This
matter
of
marrying
his
king
s
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
I
doubt
not
a
great
deal
from
the
matter
FRENCHMAN
And
then
his
banishment
IACHIMO
Ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
a
beggar
without
less
quality
But
how
comes
it
he
is
to
sojourn
with
you
How
creeps
acquaintance
PHILARIO
His
father
and
I
were
soldiers
together
to
whom
I
have
been
often
bound
for
no
less
than
my
life
Enter
POSTHUMUS
Here
comes
the
Briton
Let
him
be
so
entertained
amongst
you
as
suits
with
gentlemen
of
your
knowing
to
a
stranger
of
his
quality
I
beseech
you
all
be
better
known
to
this
gentleman
whom
I
commend
to
you
as
a
noble
friend
of
mine
How
worthy
he
is
I
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
FRENCHMAN
Sir
we
have
known
together
in
Orleans
POSTHUMUS
Since
when
I
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
I
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
FRENCHMAN
Sir
you
o
errate
my
poor
kindness
I
was
glad
I
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
a
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
a
nature
POSTHUMUS
By
your
pardon
sir
I
was
then
a
young
traveller
rather
shunn
d
to
go
even
with
what
I
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
judgment
if
I
offend
not
to
say
it
is
mended
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
FRENCHMAN
Faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
fall
n
both
IACHIMO
Can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
FRENCHMAN
Safely
I
think
Twas
a
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
It
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
vouching
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
affirmation
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
France
IACHIMO
That
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
gentleman
s
opinion
by
this
worn
out
POSTHUMUS
She
holds
her
virtue
still
and
I
my
mind
IACHIMO
You
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
Italy
POSTHUMUS
Being
so
far
provok
d
as
I
was
in
France
I
would
abate
her
nothing
though
I
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
IACHIMO
As
fair
and
as
good
a
kind
of
hand
in
hand
comparison
had
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
Britain
If
she
went
before
others
I
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
I
have
beheld
I
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
I
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
POSTHUMUS
I
prais
d
her
as
I
rated
her
So
do
I
my
stone
IACHIMO
What
do
you
esteem
it
at
POSTHUMUS
More
than
the
world
enjoys
IACHIMO
Either
your
unparagon
d
mistress
is
dead
or
she
s
outpriz
d
by
a
trifle
POSTHUMUS
You
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
a
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
IACHIMO
Which
the
gods
have
given
you
POSTHUMUS
Which
by
their
graces
I
will
keep
IACHIMO
You
may
wear
her
in
title
yours
but
you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
Your
ring
may
be
stol
n
too
So
your
brace
of
unprizable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
casual
a
cunning
thief
or
a
that
way
accomplish
d
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first
and
last
POSTHUMUS
Your
Italy
contains
none
so
accomplish
d
a
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my
mistress
if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
I
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
I
fear
not
my
ring
PHILARIO
Let
us
leave
here
gentlemen
POSTHUMUS
Sir
with
all
my
heart
This
worthy
signior
I
thank
him
makes
no
stranger
of
me
we
are
familiar
at
first
IACHIMO
With
five
times
so
much
conversation
I
should
get
ground
of
your
fair
mistress
make
her
go
back
even
to
the
yielding
had
I
admittance
and
opportunity
to
friend
POSTHUMUS
No
no
IACHIMO
I
dare
thereupon
pawn
the
moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
o
ervalues
it
something
But
I
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
I
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
POSTHUMUS
You
are
a
great
deal
abus
d
in
too
bold
a
persuasion
and
I
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
y
are
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
IACHIMO
What
s
that
POSTHUMUS
A
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserve
more
a
punishment
too
PHILARIO
Gentlemen
enough
of
this
It
came
in
too
suddenly
let
it
die
as
it
was
born
and
I
pray
you
be
better
acquainted
