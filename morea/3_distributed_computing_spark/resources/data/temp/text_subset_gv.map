Rebellious

Profaners

Will

What
ho
you
men
you

That
quench
the
fire
of
your
pernicious
rage
With
purple
fountains
issuing
from

On

of
torture
from
those
bloody
hands
Throw
your
mistempered
weapons
to
the
ground
And
hear
the
sentence
of
your
moved
prince
Three
civil
brawls
bred
of
an
airy
word
By
thee
old
Capulet
and
Montague
Have
thrice
disturb
d
the
quiet
of
our
streets
And
made
Verona
s
ancient
citizens
Cast
by
their
grave
beseeming
ornaments
To
wield
old

in

as
old
Cank
red

part
your

red

If

Your

forfeit

For

You

And
Montague
come

this
afternoon
To

our
farther
pleasure
in

To

Once
more
on
pain

death
all

depart
Exeunt
all
but
Montague
his
Wife
and
Benvolio
Mon
Who
set
this
ancient
quarrel
new
abroach
Speak
nephew
were
you
by
when
it
began
Ben
Here
were
the
servants
of
your
adversary
And
yours
close
fighting
ere
I
did
approach
I
drew
to
part
them
In
the
instant
came
The
fiery
Tybalt
with
his
sword
prepar
d
Which
as
he
breath
d
defiance
to
my
ears
He
swung
about
his
head
and
cut
the
winds
Who
nothing
hurt
withal
hiss
d
him
in
scorn
While
we
were
interchanging
thrusts
and
blows
Came
more
and
more
and
fought
on
part
and
part
Till
the
Prince
came
who
parted
either
part
M
Wife
O
where
is
Romeo
Saw
you
him
to
day
Right
glad
I
am
he
was
not
at
this
fray
Ben
Madam
an
hour
before
the
worshipp
d
sun
Peer
d
forth
the
golden
window
of
the
East
A
troubled
mind
drave
me
to
walk
abroad
Where
underneath
the
grove
of
sycamore
That
westward
rooteth
from
the
city
s
side
So
early
walking
did
I
see
your
son
Towards
him
I
made
but
he
was
ware
of
me
And
stole
into
the
covert
of
the
wood
I
measuring
his
affections
by
my
own
Which
then
most
sought
where
most
might
not
be
found
Being
one
too
many
by
my
weary
self
Pursu
d
my
humour
not
Pursuing
his
And
gladly
shunn
d
who
gladly
fled
from
me
Mon
Many
a
morning
hath
he
there
been
seen
With
tears
augmenting
the
fresh
morning
s
dew
Adding
to
clouds
more
clouds
with
his
deep
sighs
But
all
so
soon
as
the
all
cheering
sun
Should
in
the
farthest
East
bean
to
draw
The
shady
curtains
from
Aurora
s
bed
Away
from
light
steals
home
my
heavy
son
And
private
in
his
chamber
pens
himself
Shuts
up
his
windows
locks
fair
daylight
And
makes
himself
an
artificial
night
Black
and
portentous
must
this
humour
prove
Unless
good
counsel
may
the
cause
remove
Ben
My
noble
uncle
do
you
know
the
cause
Mon
I
neither
know
it
nor
can
learn
of
him
Ben
Have
you
importun
d
him
by
any
means
Mon
Both
by
myself
and
many
other
friend
But
he
his
own
affections
counsellor
Is
to
himself
I
will
not
say
how
true
But
to
himself
so
secret
and
so
close
So
far
from
sounding
and
discovery
As
is
the
bud
bit
with
an
envious
worm
Ere
he
can
spread
his
sweet
leaves
to
the
air
Or
dedicate
his
beauty
to
the
sun
Could
we
but
learn
from
whence
his
sorrows
grow
We
would
as
willingly
give
cure
as
know
Enter
Romeo
Ben
See
where
he
comes
So
please
you
step
aside
I
ll
know
his
grievance
or
be
much
denied
Mon
I
would
thou
wert
so
happy
by
thy
stay
To
hear
true
shrift
Come
madam
let
s
away
Exeunt

Good

But

Ay

Was
that
my

so
fast
Ben
It
was
What
sadness
lengthens
Romeo
s
hours
Rom
Not

them
short
Ben
In

Rom
Out
Ben
Of
love
Rom
Out
of
her
favour
where
I
am
in
love
Ben
Alas
that
love
so
gentle
in
his
view
Should
be
so
tyrannous
and
rough
in
proof
Rom
Alas
that
love
whose
view
is
muffled
still
Should
without
eyes
see
pathways
to
his
will
Where
shall
we
dine
O
me
What
fray
was
here
Yet
tell
me
not
for
I
have
heard
it
all
Here
s
much
to
do
with
hate
but
more
with
love
Why
then
O
brawling
love
O
loving
hate
O
anything
of
nothing
first
create
O
heavy
lightness
serious
vanity
Misshapen
chaos
of
well
seeming
forms
Feather
of
lead
bright
smoke
cold
fire
sick
health
Still
waking
sleep
that
is
not
what
it
is
This
love

I
that

no
love
in
this
Dost
thou
not
laugh
Ben
No

I
rather
weep
Rom
Good
heart
at
what
Ben
At
thy
good
heart
s
oppression
Rom
Why
such
is
love
s
transgression
Griefs
of
mine
own
lie
heavy
in
my
breast
Which
thou
wilt
propagate
to
have
it
prest
With
more
of
thine
This
love
that
thou
hast
shown
Doth
add
more
grief
to
too
much
of
mine
own
Love
is
a
smoke

the
fume
of

Being

d
a

sparkling
in

Being

What

A
madness
most
discreet
A
choking

Farewell

Soft

An

Tell

Well

And

From

O
she

That
when
she

Then
she
hath

still
live
chaste
Rom
She
hath
and
in
that
sparing
makes
huge
waste
For
beauty
starv

her
severity
Cuts

She

To
merit

by
making
me

She

forsworn

Do

O
teach
me
how
I

Ben
By
giving
liberty
unto
thine
eyes
Examine
other

Rom
Tis
the
way
To
call
hers
exquisite
in

These
happy
masks
that
kiss
fair
ladies

Being
black

He

The
precious

of
his

lost
Show

What

as
a
note
Where

of
all
days
in
the
year
Come
Lammas
Eve
at
night
shall
she
be
fourteen
Susan
and
she
God
rest
all
Christian
souls
Were
of
an
age
Well
Susan
is
with
God
She
was
too
good
for
me
But
as
I
said
On
Lammas
Eve
at
night
shall
she
be
fourteen
That
shall
she
marry
I
remember
it
well
Tis
since
the
earthquake
now
eleven
years
And
she
was
wean
d
I
never
shall
forget
it
Of
all
the
days
of
the
year
upon
that
day
For
I
had
then
laid
wormwood
to
my
dug
Sitting
in
the
sun
under
the
dovehouse
wall
My
lord
and
you
were
then
at
Mantua
Nay
I
do
bear
a
brain
But
as
I
said
When
it
did
taste
the
wormwood
on
the
nipple
Of
my
dug
and
felt
it
bitter
pretty
fool
To
see
it
tetchy
and
fall
out
with
the
dug
Shake
quoth
the
dovehouse
Twas
no
need
I
trow
To
bid
me
trudge
And
since
that
time
it
is
eleven
years
For
then
she
could
stand
high
lone
nay
by
th
rood
She
could
have
run
and
waddled
all
about
For
even
the
day
before
she
broke
her
brow
And
then
my
husband
God
be
with
his
soul
A
was
a
merry
man
took
up
the
child
Yea
quoth
he
dost
thou
fall
upon
thy
face
Thou
wilt
fall
backward
when
thou
hast
more
wit
Wilt
thou
not
Jule
and
by
my
holidam
The
pretty
wretch
left
crying
and
said
Ay
To
see
now
how
a
jest
shall
come
about
I
warrant
an
I
should
live
a
thousand
yeas
I
never
should
forget
it
Wilt
thou
not
Jule
quoth
he
And
pretty
fool
it
stinted
and
said
Ay
Wife
Enough
of
this
I
pray
thee
hold
thy
peace
Nurse
Yes
madam
Yet
I
cannot
choose
but
laugh
To
think
it
should
leave
crying
and
say
Ay
And
yet
I
warrant
it
bad
upon
it
brow
A
bump
as
big
as
a
young
cock
rel
s
stone
A
perilous
knock
and
it
cried
bitterly
Yea
quoth
my
husband
fall
st
upon
thy
face
Thou
wilt
fall
backward
when
thou
comest
to
age
Wilt
thou
not
Jule
It
stinted
and
said
Ay
Jul
And
stint
thou
too
I
pray
thee
nurse
say
I
Nurse
Peace
I
have
done
God
mark
thee
to
his
grace
Thou

the
prettiest
babe

An
I
might
live
to
see
thee
married
once
I
have
my
wish
Wife
Marry

the
very
theme
I
came
to
talk
of
Tell

daughter
Juliet
How
stands
your
disposition
to
be
married
Jul
It
is
an
honour
that
I
dream
not
of
Nurse
An
honour
Were
not
I
thine
only
nurse
I
would
say
thou
hadst
suck
d
wisdom
from
thy
teat
Wife
Well
think
of
marriage
now
Younger
than
you
Here
in
Verona
ladies
of

Are
made
already
mothers
By
my
count
I
was
your
mother
much
upon
these
years
That
you
are
now
a
maid
Thus
then
in
brief
The
valiant
Paris
seeks
you
for
his
love
Nurse
A
man
young
lady
lady
such
a
man
As
all
the
world
why

Wife
Verona

not
such
a
flower
Nurse
Nay

Can

And

there
with

Examine
every
married
lineament
And
see
how
one
another
lends
content
And
what
obscur
d
in
this
fair
volume
lies
Find
written
in
the
margent
of
his
eyes
This
precious
book
of
love
this
unbound
lover
To
beautify
him
only
lacks
a
cover
The
fish
lives
in
the
sea
and
tis
much
pride
For
fair
without
the
fair
within
to
hide
That
book
in
many
s
eyes
doth
share
the
glory
That
in
gold
clasps
locks
in
the
golden
story
So
shall
you

doth
possess
By

A

Enter
Romeo
Mercutio
Benvolio
with
five
or
six
other
Maskers
Torchbearers
Rom
What
shall
this
speech
be
spoke
for
our
excuse
Or
shall
we
on
without
apology
Ben
The
date
is
out
of
such
prolixity
We
ll
have
no
Cupid
hoodwink
d
with
a
scarf
Bearing
a
Tartar
s
painted
bow
of
lath
Scaring
the
ladies
like
a
crowkeeper
Nor
no
without
book
prologue
faintly
spoke
After
the
prompter
for
our
entrance
But
let
them
measure
us
by
what
they
will
We
ll
measure
them
a
measure
and
be
gone
Rom
Give
me
a
torch
I
am
not
for
this
ambling
Being
but
heavy
I
will
bear
the
light
Mer
Nay
gentle
Romeo
we
must
have
you
dance
Rom
Not
I
believe
me
You
have
dancing
shoes
With
nimble
soles
I
have
a
soul
of
lead
So
stakes
me
to
the
ground
I
cannot
move
Mer
You
are
a
lover
Borrow
Cupid
s
wings
And
soar
with
them
above
a
common
bound
Rom
I
am
too
sore
enpierced
with
his
shaft
To
soar
with
his
light
feathers
and
so
bound
I
cannot
bound
a
pitch
above
dull
woe
Under
love
s
heavy
burthen
do
I
sink
Mer
And
to
sink
in
it
should
you
burthen
love
Too
great
oppression
for
a
tender
thing
Rom
Is
love
a
tender
thing
It
is
too
rough
Too
rude
too
boist
rous
and
it
pricks
like
thorn
Mer
If
love
be
rough
with
you
be
rough
with
love
Prick
love
for
pricking
and
you
beat
love
down
Give
me
a
case
to
put
my
visage
in
A
visor
for
a
visor
What
care
I
What
curious
eye
doth
quote
deformities
Here
are
the
beetle
brows
shall
blush
for
me
Ben
Come
knock
and
enter
and
no
sooner
in
But
every
man
betake
him
to
his
legs
Rom
A
torch
for
me
Let
wantons
light
of
heart
Tickle
the
senseless
rushes
with
their
heels
For
I
am
proverb
d
with
a
grandsire
phrase
I
ll
be
a
candle
holder
and
look
on
The
game

so
fair
and
I
am
done
Mer
Tut

Up

Come

burn
daylight
ho
Rom
Nay
that
s
not
so
Mer
I
mean
sir
in
delay
We
waste
our
lights
in

like
lamps

Take
our

meaning

judgment

Five
times
in
that

wits
Rom
And
we
mean
well
in
going
to
this
masque
But
tis
no
wit
to
go
Mer
Why
may
one
ask
Rom
I
dreamt
a
dream
to
night
Mer
And
so
did
I
Rom
Well
what
was
yours
Mer
That
dreamers
often
lie
Rom
In
bed
asleep
while
they
do
dream
things
true
Mer
O
then
I
see
Queen
Mab
hath
been
with
you
She
is
the
fairies
midwife
and
she
comes
In
shape
no
bigger
than
an
agate
stone
On
the
forefinger
of
an
alderman
Drawn
with
a
team
of
little
atomies
Athwart
men
s
noses
as
they
lie
asleep
Her
wagon
spokes
made
of
long
spinners
legs
The
cover
of
the
wings
of
grasshoppers
Her
traces
of
the
smallest
spider
s
web
Her
collars
of
the
moonshine
s
wat
ry
beams
Her
whip
of
cricket
s
bone
the
lash
of
film
