Her
wagoner
a
small
grey
coated
gnat
Not
half
so
big
as
a
round
little
worm
Prick
d
from
the
lazy
finger
of
a
maid
Her
chariot
is
an
empty
hazelnut
Made
by
the
joiner
squirrel
or
old
grub
Time
out
o
mind
the
fairies
coachmakers
And
in
this
state
she
gallops
night
by
night
Through
lovers
brains
and
then
they
dream
of
love
O
er
courtiers
knees
that
dream
on
cursies
straight
O
er
lawyers
fingers
who
straight
dream
on
fees
O
er
ladies
lips
who
straight
on
kisses
dream
Which
oft
the
angry
Mab
with
blisters
plagues
Because
their
breaths
with
sweetmeats
tainted
are
Sometime
she
gallops
o
er
a
courtier
s
nose
And
then
dreams
he
of
smelling
out
a
suit
And
sometime
comes
she
with
a
tithe
pig
s
tail
Tickling
a
parson
s
nose
as
a
lies
asleep
Then
dreams
he
of
another
benefice
Sometimes
she
driveth
o
er
a
soldier
s
neck
And
then
dreams
he
of
cutting
foreign
throats
Of
breaches
ambuscadoes
Spanish
blades
Of
healths
five
fadom
deep
and
then
anon
Drums
in
his
ear
at
which
he
starts
and
wakes
And
being
thus
frighted
swears
a
prayer
or
two
And
sleeps
again
This
is
that
very
Mab
That
plats
the
manes
of
horses
in
the
night
And
bakes
the
elflocks
in
foul
sluttish
hairs
Which
once
untangled
much
misfortune
bodes
This
is
the
hag
when
maids
lie
on
their
backs
That
presses
them
and
learns
them
first
to
bear
Making
them
women
of
good
carriage
This
is

Peace

Thou

Mer
True
I
talk
of
dreams
Which
are
the
children
of
an
idle
brain
Begot
of
nothing
but
vain
fantasy
Which
is
as
thin
of
substance
as
the
air
And
more
inconstant
than
the
wind
who
wooes
Even
now
the
frozen
bosom
of
the
North
And
being

d
puffs
away
from
thence
Turning

Supper

shall
come

late

I
fear
too
early
for
my
mind
misgives
Some
consequence
yet
hanging
in
the
stars
Shall
bitterly
begin
his
fearful
date
With
this
night
s
revels
and
expire
the
term
Of
a
despised
life
clos

By

Scene
II
Capulet
s
orchard
Enter
Romeo
Rom
He
jests
at
scars
that
never
felt
a
wound
Enter
Juliet
above
at
a
window
But
soft
What
light
through
yonder
window
breaks
It
is
the
East
and
Juliet
is
the
sun
Arise
fair
sun
and
kill
the
envious
moon
Who
is
already
sick
and
pale
with
grief
That
thou
her
maid
art
far
more
fair
than
she
Be
not
her
maid
since
she
is
envious
Her
vestal
livery
is
but
sick
and
green
And
none
but
fools
do
wear
it
Cast
it
off
It
is
my
lady
O
it
is
my
love
O
that
she
knew
she
were
She
speaks
yet
she
says
nothing
What
of
that
Her
eye
discourses
I
will
answer
it
I
am
too
bold
tis
not
to
me
she
speaks
Two
of
the
fairest
stars
in
all
the
heaven
Having
some
business
do
entreat
her
eyes
To
twinkle
in
their
spheres
till
they
return
What
if
her
eyes
were
there
they
in
her
head
The
brightness
of
her
cheek
would
shame
those
stars
As
daylight
doth
a
lamp
her
eyes
in
heaven
Would
through
the
airy
region
stream
so
bright
That
birds
would
sing
and
think
it
were
not
night
See
how
she
leans
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
O
that
I
were
a
glove
upon
that
hand
That
I
might
touch
that
cheek
Jul
Ay
me
Rom
She
speaks
O
speak
again
bright
angel
for
thou
art
As
glorious
to
this
night
being
o
er
my
head
As
is
a
winged
messenger
of
heaven
Unto
the
white
upturned
wond
ring
eyes
Of
mortals
that
fall
back
to
gaze
on
him
When
he
bestrides
the
lazy
pacing
clouds
And
sails
upon
the
bosom
of
the
air
Jul
O
Romeo
Romeo
wherefore
art
thou
Romeo
Deny
thy
father
and
refuse
thy
name
Or
if
thou
wilt
not
be
but
sworn
my
love
And
I
ll
no
longer
be
a
Capulet

aside
Shall
I
hear
more
or
shall
I
speak
at
this
Jul
Tis
but
thy
name
that
is
my
enemy
Thou
art
thyself
though
not
a
Montague
What
s
Montague
it
is
nor
hand
nor
foot
Nor
arm
nor
face
nor
any
other
part
Belonging
to
a
man
O
be
some
other
name
What
s
in
a
name
That
which
we
call
a
rose
By
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
So
Romeo
would
were
he
not
Romeo
call
d
Retain
that
dear
perfection
which
he
owes
Without
that
title
Romeo
doff
thy
name
And
for
that
name
which
is
no
part
of
thee
Take
all
myself
Rom
I
take
thee
at
thy
word
Call
me
but
love
and
I
ll
be
new
baptiz
d
Henceforth
I
never
will
be
Romeo
Jul
What
man
art
thou
that
thus
bescreen
d
in
night
So
stumblest
on
my
counsel
Rom
By
a
name
I
know
not
how
to
tell
thee
who
I
am
My
name
dear
saint
is
hateful
to
myself
Because
it
is
an
enemy
to
thee
Had
I
it
written
I
would
tear
the
word
Jul
My
ears
have
yet
not
drunk
a
hundred
words
Of
that
tongue
s
utterance
yet
I
know
the
sound
Art
thou
not
Romeo
and
a
Montague
Rom
Neither
fair
saint
if
either
thee
dislike
Jul
How
cam
st
thou
hither
tell
me
and
wherefore
The
orchard
walls
are
high
and
hard
to
climb
And
the
place
death
considering
who
thou
art
If
any
of
my
kinsmen
find
thee
here
Rom
With
love
s
light
wings
did
I
o
erperch
these
walls
For
stony
limits
cannot
hold
love
out
And
what
love
can
do
that
dares
love
attempt
Therefore
thy
kinsmen
are
no
let
to
me
Jul
If
they
do
see
thee
they
will
murther
thee
Rom
Alack
there
lies
more
peril
in
thine
eye
Than
twenty
of
their
swords
Look
thou
but
sweet
And
I
am
proof
against
their
enmity
Jul
I
would
not
for
the
world
they
saw
thee
here
Rom
I
have
night
s
cloak
to
hide
me
from
their
sight
And
but
thou
love
me
let
them
find
me
here
My
life
were
better
ended
by
their
hate
Than
death
prorogued
wanting
of
thy
love
Jul
By
whose
direction
found
st
thou
out
this
place
Rom
By
love
that
first
did
prompt
me
to
enquire
He
lent
me
counsel
and
I
lent
him
eyes
I
am
no
pilot
yet
wert
thou
as
far
As
that
vast
shore
wash
d
with
the
farthest
sea
I
would
adventure
for
such
merchandise
Jul
Thou
knowest
the
mask
of
night
is
on
my
face
Else
would
a
maiden
blush
bepaint
my
cheek
For
that
which
thou
hast
heard
me
speak
to
night
Fain
would
I
dwell
on
form
fain
fain
deny
What
I
have
spoke
but
farewell
compliment
Dost
thou
love
me
I
know
thou
wilt
say
Ay
And
I
will
take
thy
word
Yet
if
thou
swear
st
Thou
mayst
prove
false
At
lovers
perjuries
They
say
Jove
laughs
O
gentle
Romeo
If
thou
dost
love
pronounce
it
faithfully
Or
if
thou
thinkest
I
am
too
quickly
won
I
ll
frown
and
be
perverse
and
say
thee
nay
So
thou
wilt
woo
but
else
not
for
the
world
In
truth
fair
Montague
I
am
too
fond
And
therefore
thou
mayst
think
my
haviour
light
But
trust
me
gentleman
I
ll
prove
more
true
Than
those
that
have
more
cunning
to
be
strange
I
should
have
been
more
strange
I
must
confess
But
that
thou
overheard
st
ere
I
was
ware
My
true
love
passion
Therefore
pardon
me
And
not
impute
this
yielding
to
light
love
Which
the
dark
night
hath
so
discovered
Rom
Lady
by
yonder
blessed
moon
I
swear
That
tips
with
silver
all
these
fruit
tree
tops
Jul
O
swear
not
by
the
moon
th
inconstant
moon
That
monthly
changes
in
her
circled
orb
Lest
that
thy
love
prove
likewise
variable
Rom
What
shall
I
swear
by
Jul
Do
not
swear
at
all
Or
if
thou
wilt
swear
by
thy
gracious
self
Which
is
the
god
of
my
idolatry
And
I
ll
believe
thee
Rom
If
my
heart
s
dear
love
Jul
Well
do
not
swear
Although
I
joy
in
thee
I
have
no
joy
of
this
contract
to
night
It
is
too
rash
too
unadvis
d
too
sudden
Too
like
the
lightning
which
doth
cease
to
be
Ere
one
can
say
It
lightens
Sweet
good
night
This
bud
of
love
by
summer
s
ripening
breath
May
prove
a
beauteous
flow
r
when
next
we
meet
Good
night
good
night
As
sweet
repose
and
rest
Come
to
thy
heart
as
that
within
my
breast
Rom
O
wilt
thou
leave
me
so
unsatisfied
Jul
What
satisfaction
canst
thou
have
to
night
Rom
Th
exchange
of
thy
love
s
faithful
vow
for
mine
Jul
I
gave
thee
mine
before
thou
didst
request
it
And
yet
I
would
it
were
to
give
again
Rom
Would
st
thou
withdraw
it
For
what
purpose
love
Jul
But
to
be
frank
and
give
it
thee
again
And
yet
I
wish
but
for
the
thing
I
have
My
bounty
is
as
boundless
as
the
sea
My
love
as
deep
the
more
I
give
to
thee
The
more
I
have
for
both
are
infinite
I
hear
some
noise
within
Dear
love
adieu
Nurse
calls
within
Anon
good
nurse
Sweet
Montague
be
true
Stay
but
a
little
I
will
come
again
Exit
Rom
O
blessed
blessed
night
I
am
afeard
Being
in
night
all
this
is
but
a
dream
Too
flattering
sweet
to
be
substantial
Enter
Juliet
above
Jul
Three
words
dear
Romeo
and
good
night
indeed
If
that
thy
bent
of
love
be
honourable
Thy
purpose
marriage
send
me
word
to
morrow
By
one
that
I
ll
procure
to
come
to
thee
Where
and
what
time
thou
wilt
perform
the
rite
And
all
my
fortunes
at
thy
foot
I
ll
lay
And
follow
thee
my
lord
throughout
the
world
Nurse
within
Madam
Jul
I
come
anon
But
if
thou
meanest
not
well
I
do
beseech
thee
Nurse
within
Madam
Jul
By
and
by
I
come
To
cease
thy
suit
and
leave
me
to
my
grief
To
morrow
will
I
send
Rom
So
thrive
my
soul
Jul
A
thousand
times
good
night
Exit
Rom
A
thousand
times
the
worse
to
want
thy
light
Love
goes
toward
love
as
schoolboys
from
their
books
But
love
from
love
towards
school
with
heavy
looks
Enter
Juliet
again
above
Jul
Hist
Romeo
hist
O
for
a
falconer
s
voice
To
lure
this
tassel
gentle
back
again
Bondage
is
hoarse
and
may
not
speak
aloud
Else
would
I
tear
the
cave
where
Echo
lies
And
make
her
airy
tongue
more
hoarse
than
mine
With
repetition
of
my
Romeo
s
name
Romeo
Rom
It
is
my
soul
that
calls
upon
my
name
How
silver
sweet
sound
lovers
tongues
by
night
Like
softest
music
to
attending
ears
Jul
Romeo
Rom
My
dear
Jul
At
what
o
clock
to
morrow
Shall
I
send
to
thee
Rom
By
the
hour
of
nine
Jul
I
will
not
fail
Tis
twenty
years
till
then
I
have
forgot
why
I
did
call
thee
back
Rom
Let
me
stand
here
till
thou
remember
it
Jul
I
shall
forget
to
have
thee
still
stand
there
Rememb
ring
how
I
love
thy
company
Rom
And
I
ll
still
stay
to
have
thee
still
forget
Forgetting
any
other
home
but
this
Jul
Tis
almost
morning
I
would
have
thee
gone
And
yet
no
farther
than
a
wanton
s
bird
That
lets
it
hop
a
little
from
her
hand
Like
a
poor
prisoner
in
his
twisted
gyves
And
with
a
silk
thread
plucks
it
back
again
So
loving
jealous
of
his
liberty
Rom
I
would
I
were
thy
bird
Jul
Sweet
so
would
I
Yet
I
should
kill
thee
with
much
cherishing
Good
night
good
night
Parting
is
such
sweet
sorrow
That
I
shall
say
good
night
till
it
be
morrow
Exit
Rom
Sleep
dwell
upon
thine
eyes
peace
in
thy
breast
Would
I
were
sleep
and
peace
so
sweet
to
rest
