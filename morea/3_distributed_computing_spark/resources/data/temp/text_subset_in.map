Vouchsafe

The

To

weep
For

Is

a
shadow
And
to
your
shadow
will
I
make
true
love

Send

O

Think

Valiant

well

d
Thou
art
not
ignorant
what
dear
good
will
I
bear
unto
the

Valentine
Nor
how

Vain
Thurio

and
I

No

died
Upon

Sir

I
would
to

To

I
do
desire
thy
worthy
company
Upon

I
repose
Urge
not
my

But

upon
my
grief
a
lady
s
grief
And
on
the
justice
of
my
flying
hence
To
keep
me
from
a
most
unholy

Which

rewards
with
plagues
I

Under

S
Window
Enter
LAUNCE
with
his
dog
LAUNCE
When
a
man
s
servant
shall
play
the
cur
with
him
look
you
it
goes
hard
one
that
I
brought
up
of
a
puppy
one
that
I
sav
d
from
drowning
when
three
or
four
of
his
blind
brothers
and
sisters
went
to
it
I
have
taught
him
even
as
one
would
say
precisely
Thus
I
would
teach
a
dog
I
was
sent
to
deliver
him
as
a
present
to
Mistress
Silvia
from
my
master
and
I
came
no
sooner
into
the
dining
chamber
but
he
steps
me
to
her
trencher
and
steals
her
capon
s
leg
O
tis
a
foul
thing
when
a
cur
cannot
keep
himself
in
all
companies
I
would
have
as
one
should
say
one
that
takes
upon
him
to
be
a
dog
indeed
to
be
as
it
were
a
dog
at
all
things
If
I
had
not
had
more
wit
than
he
to
take
a
fault
upon
me
that
he
did
I
think
verily
he
had
been
hang
d
for
t
sure
as
I
live
he
had
suffer
d
for
t
You
shall
judge
He
thrusts
me
himself
into
the
company
of
three
or
four
gentleman
like
dogs
under
the
Duke
s
table
he
had
not
been
there
bless
the
mark
a
pissing
while
but
all
the
chamber
smelt
him
Out
with
the
dog
says
one
What
cur
is
that
says
another
Whip
him
out
says
the
third
Hang
him
up
says
the
Duke
I
having
been
acquainted
with
the
smell
before
knew
it
was
Crab
and
goes
me
to
the
fellow
that
whips
the
dogs
Friend
quoth
I
you
mean
to
whip
the
dog
Ay

I
quoth
he
You
do
him
the
more
wrong
quoth
I
twas
I
did
the
thing
you
wot
of
He
makes
me
no
more
ado
but
whips
me
out
of
the
chamber
How
many
masters
would
do
this
for
his
servant
Nay
I
ll
be
sworn
I
have
sat
in
the
stock
for
puddings

hath
stol

stood
on

Thou

not
of
this

Nay
I
remember
the
trick

d
me
when
I
took
my
leave
of
Madam
Silvia
Did
not
I
bid
thee
still
mark
me
and
do
as
I
do
When
didst
thou
see
me
heave
up
my
leg
and
make
water
against
a
gentlewoman

farthingale
Didst

such
a
trick
Enter

Go

LAUNCE
A

still
an
end
turns

I

Partly

of
such
a
youth
That
can
with
some
discretion
do
my
business
For

no
trusting
to

But

and
thy
behaviour
Which

Therefore

JULIA
Alas

Why

Alas

PROTEUS
Wherefore

JULIA
Because
methinks
that
she
lov
d
you
as
well
As
you
do
love
your
lady
Silvia
She
dreams
on
him
that
has
forgot
her
love
You
dote
on
her
that
cares
not
for
your

Tis
pity
love
should
be
so
contrary
And
thinking
on
it
makes

cry
Alas

Alas

d
A

the
shepherd
of
thy
lambs
Alas
poor
fool
why
do
I
pity
him
That
with
his
very
heart
despiseth
me
Because
he
loves
her
he
despiseth
me
Because
I
love
him
I
must
pity
him
This
ring
I
gave
him
when
he
parted
from
me
To
bind
him
to
remember
my
good
will
And
now
am
I
unhappy
messenger
To

for
that
which
I
would
not
obtain
To

that
which
I
would
have
refus
d
To
praise
his
faith
which
I
would
have
disprais
d
I
am
my
master
s
true
confirmed
love
But
cannot
be
true
servant
to
my
master
Unless
I
prove
false
traitor
to
myself
Yet
will
I
woo
for
him
but
yet
so
coldly
As
heaven
it
knows
I
would

If

Tell

One
Julia
that

Pardon

Deliver

me
look
on
that

JULIA
It
may
not
be
good
madam
pardon
me
SILVIA
There
hold
I
will
not
look
upon
your
master
s
lines
I
know
they
are
stuff
d
with
protestations
And
full
of
new
found
oaths
which
he
wul
break
As
easily
as
I
do
tear
his
paper
JULIA
Madam
he
sends
your
ladyship
this
ring
SILVIA
The
more
shame
for
him
that
he
sends
it
me
For
I
have
heard
him
say
a
thousand
times
His
Julia
gave
it
him
at
his
departure
Though
his
false
finger
have
profan
d
the
ring
Mine

so
much
wrong
JULIA
She
thanks

SILVIA
What
say
st
thou
JULIA
I
thank
you
madam
that
you
tender
her
Poor
gentlewoman
my
master
wrongs
her
much
SILVIA
Dost
thou
know
her
JULIA
Almost
as
well
as
I
do
know
myself
To
think
upon
her
woes
I
do
protest
That
I
have
wept
a
hundred
several
times
SILVIA
Belike
she
thinks
that
Proteus
hath
forsook
her
JULIA
I
think
she
doth
and
that
s
her
cause
of
sorrow
SILVIA
Is
she
not
passing
fair
JULIA
She
hath
been
fairer
madam
than
she
is
When
she
did
think
my
master
lov
d
her
well
She
in
my
judgment
was
as
fair
as
you
But
since
she
did
neglect
her
looking
glass
And
threw
her
sun
expelling
mask
away
The
air
hath
starv
d
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
And
pinch
d
the
lily
tincture
of
her
face
That
now
she
is
become
as
black
as
I
SILVIA
How
tall
was
she
JULIA
About
my
stature
for
at
Pentecost
When
all
our
pageants
of
delight
were
play
d
Our
youth
got
me
to
play
the
woman
s
part
And
I
was
trimm
d
in
Madam
Julia
s
gown
Which
served
me
as
fit
by
all
men
s
judgments
As
if
the
garment
had
been
made
for
me
Therefore
I
know
she
is
about
my
height
And
at
that
time
I
made
her
weep
a
good
For
I
did
play
a
lamentable
part
Madam
twas
Ariadne
passioning
For
Theseus
perjury
and
unjust
flight
Which
I
so
lively
acted
with
my
tears
That
my
poor
mistress
moved
therewithal
Wept
bitterly
and
would
I
might
be
dead
If
I
in
thought
felt
not
her
very
sorrow
SILVIA
She
is
beholding
to
thee
gentle
youth
Alas
poor
lady
desolate
and
left
I
weep
myself
to
think
upon
thy
words
Here
youth
there
is
my
purse
I
give
thee
this
For
thy
sweet
mistress
sake
because
thou
lov
st
her
Farewell
Exit
SILVIA
with
ATTENDANTS
JULIA
And
she
shall
thank
you
for
t
if
e
er
you
know
her
A
virtuous
gentlewoman
mild
and
beautiful
I
hope
my
master
s
suit
will
be
but
cold
Since
she
respects
my
mistress
love
so
much
Alas
how
love
can
trifle
with
itself
Here
is
her
picture
let
me
see
I
think
If
I
had
such
a
tire
this
face
of
mine
Were
full
as
lovely
as
is
this
of
hers
And
yet
the
painter
flatter
d
her
a
little
Unless
I
flatter
with
myself
too
much
Her
hair
is
auburn
mine
is
perfect
yellow
If
that
be
all
the
difference
in
his
love
I
ll
get
me
such
a
colour
d
periwig
Her
eyes
are
grey
as
glass
and
so
are
mine
Ay
but
her
forehead
s
low
and
mine
s
as
high
What
should
it
be
that
he
respects
in
her
But
I
can
make
respective
in
myself
If
this
fond
Love
were
not
a
blinded
god
Come
shadow
come
and
take
this
shadow
up
For
tis
thy
rival
O
thou
senseless
form
Thou
shalt
be
worshipp
d
kiss
d
lov
d
and
ador
d
And
were
there
sense
in
his
idolatry
My
substance
should
be
statue
in
thy
stead
I
ll
use
thee
kindly
for
thy
mistress
sake
That
us
d
me
so
or
else
by
Jove
I
vow
I
should
have
scratch
d
out
your
unseeing
eyes
To
make
my
master
out
of
love
with
thee

little
THURIO
I
ll
wear
a
boot
to
make
it
somewhat
rounder
JULIA
Aside
But
love
will
not
be
spurr
d
to
what
it
loathes
THURIO
What
says
she
to
my
face
PROTEUS
She
says
it
is
a
fair
one
THURIO
Nay
then
the
wanton
lies
my
face
is
black
PROTEUS
But
pearls
are
fair
and
the
old
saying
is
Black
men
are
pearls
in
beauteous
ladies
eyes
JULIA
Aside
Tis
true
such
pearls
as
put
out
ladies
eyes
For
I
had
rather
wink
than
look
on
them
THURIO
How
likes
she
my
discourse
PROTEUS
Ill
when
you
talk
of
war
THURIO
But
well
when
I
discourse
of
love
and
peace
JULIA
Aside
But
better
indeed
when
you
hold
your
peace
THURIO
What
says
she
to
my
valour
PROTEUS
O
sir
she
makes
no
doubt
of
that
JULIA
Aside
She
needs
not
when
she
knows
it
cowardice
THURIO
What
says
she
to
my
birth
PROTEUS
That
you
are
well
deriv
d
JULIA
Aside
True
from
a
gentleman
to
a
fool
THURIO
Considers
she
my
possessions
PROTEUS
O
ay
and
pities
them
THURIO
Wherefore
JULIA
Aside
That
such
an
ass
should
owe
them
PROTEUS
That
they
are
out
by
lease
JULIA
Here
comes
the

Enter

DUKE
How
now
Sir
Proteus
how
now
Thurio
Which
of
you
saw
Sir
Eglamour
of
late
THURIO
Not
I
PROTEUS
Nor
I
DUKE
Saw
you
my
daughter
PROTEUS
Neither
DUKE
Why
then
She
s
fled
unto
that
peasant
Valentine
And
Eglamour
is
in
her
company
Tis
true
for
Friar
Lawrence
met
them
both
As
he
in
penance
wander
d
through
the
forest
Him
he
knew
well
and
guess
d
that
it
was
she
But
being
mask
d
he
was
not
sure
of
it
Besides
she
did
intend
confession
At
Patrick
s
cell
this
even
and
there
she
was
not
These
likelihoods
confirm
her
flight
from
hence
Therefore
I
pray
you
stand
not
to
discourse
But
mount
you
presently
and
meet
with
me
Upon
the
rising
of
the
mountain
foot
That
leads
toward
Mantua
whither
they
are
fled
Dispatch
sweet
gentlemen
and
follow
me
Exit
THURIO
Why
this
it
is
to
be
a
peevish
girl
That
flies
her
fortune
when
it
follows
her
I
ll
after
more
to
be
reveng
d
on
Eglamour
Than
for
the
love
of
reckless
Silvia
Exit
PROTEUS
And
I
will
follow
more
for
Silvia
s
love
Than
hate
of
Eglamour
that
goes
with
her
Exit
JULIA
And
I
will
follow
more
to
cross
that
love
Than
hate
for
Silvia
that
is
gone
for
love

VALENTINE
VALENTINE
How
use
doth
breed
a
habit
in
a
man
This
shadowy
desert
unfrequented
woods
I
better
brook
than
flourishing
peopled
towns
Here
can
I
sit
alone
unseen
of
any
And
to
the
nightingale
s
complaining
notes
Tune
my
distresses
and
record
my
woes
O
thou
that
dost
inhabit
in
my
breast
Leave
not
the
mansion
so
long
tenantless
Lest
growing
ruinous
the
building
fall
And
leave
no
memory
of
what
it
was
Repair
me
with
thy
presence
Silvia
Thou
gentle
nymph
cherish
thy
forlorn
swain
What
halloing
and
what
stir
is
this
to
day
These
are
my
mates
that
make
their
wills
their
law
Have
some
unhappy
passenger
in
chase
They
love
me
well
yet
I

much
to

To

uncivil
outrages
Withdraw

PROTEUS
Madam
this

I

That

Vouchsafe

A

And
less

I
am
sure
you
cannot
give
VALENTINE
Aside
How
like
a
dream
is
this
I
see
and

Love

patience

awhile
SILVIA
O
miserable
unhappy

Unhappy

By

Aside
And
me
when

approacheth
to
your
presence
SILVIA
Had
I
been
seized
by
a
hungry
lion
I
would
have
been
a
breakfast
to
the
beast
Rather
than
have
false
Proteus
rescue
me
O
heaven
be
judge
how
I
love
Valentine
Whose
life
s
as
tender
to
me
as

And

I

Therefore

PROTEUS
What
dangerous
action
stood

next
to
death
Would
I
not
undergo
for
one
calm
look
O
tis
the
curse
in

still

When

When

Julia

thy
first
best

For
whose
dear
sake
thou
didst
then
rend
thy
faith
Into
a
thousand
oaths
and
all
those
oaths
Descended
into
perjury
to

me
Thou
hast
no

left
now
unless

And
that

Than

All

Proteus
PROTEUS
Nay

Can

PROTEUS
Valentine
VALENTINE
Thou
common
friend

For
such
is
a

now
treacherous
man
Thou
hast
beguil

my
hopes
nought
but
mine
eye
Could
have
persuaded
me
Now
I
dare
not
say
I
have
one
friend
alive
thou
wouldst
disprove
me
Who
should
be
trusted
when
one
s
own
right
hand
Is
perjured
to
the
bosom
Proteus
I
am
sorry
I
must
never
trust
thee
more
But
count
the
world
a
stranger
for
thy
sake
The
private
wound
is
deepest
O
time
most
accurst
Mongst
all
foes
that
a

should
be
the
worst
PROTEUS
My

Forgive

Be

As

Then

At

How
