To

EXETER
It
follows
then
the
cat
must
stay
at
home
Yet
that
is
but
a
crush
d
necessity
Since
we
have
locks
to
safeguard
necessaries
And
pretty
traps
to
catch
the
petty
thieves
While
that
the
armed
hand
doth
fight
abroad
Th
advised
head
defends
itself
at
home
For
government
though
high
and
low
and
lower
Put
into
parts
doth
keep
in
one
consent
Congreeing
in
a
full
and
natural
close
Like
music
CANTERBURY
Therefore
doth
heaven
divide
The
state
of
man
in
divers
functions
Setting
endeavour
in
continual
motion
To
which
is
fixed
as
an
aim
or
but
Obedience
for
so
work
the
honey
bees
Creatures
that
by
a
rule
in
nature
teach
The
act
of
order
to
a
peopled
kingdom
They
have
a
king
and
officers
of
sorts
Where
some
like
magistrates
correct
at
home
Others
like
merchants
venture
trade
abroad
Others
like
soldiers
armed
in
their
stings
Make
boot
upon
the
summer
s
velvet
buds
Which
pillage
they
with
merry
march
bring
home
To
the
tent
royal
of
their
emperor
Who
busied
in
his
majesty
surveys
The
singing
masons
building
roofs
of
gold
The
civil
citizens
kneading
up
the
honey
The
poor
mechanic
porters
crowding
in
Their
heavy
burdens
at
his
narrow
gate
The
sad
ey
d
justice
with
his
surly
hum
Delivering
o
er
to
executors
pale
The
lazy
yawning
drone
I
this
infer
That
many
things
having
full
reference
To
one
consent
may
work
contrariously
As
many
arrows
loosed
several
ways
Come
to
one
mark
as
many
ways
meet
in
one
town
As
many
fresh
streams
meet
in
one
salt
sea
As
many
lines
close
in
the
dial
s
centre
So
many
a
thousand
actions
once
afoot
End
in
one
purpose
and
be
all
well
home
Without
defeat
Therefore
to
France
my
liege
Divide
your
happy
England
into
four
Whereof
take
you
one
quarter
into
France
And
you
withal
shall
make
all
Gallia
shake
If
we
with
thrice
such
powers
left
at
home
Cannot
defend
our
own
doors
from
the
dog
Let
us
be
worried
and
our

lose
The

Your

AMBASSADOR
May
t
please
your
Majesty
to
give
us
leave
Freely
to
render
what
we
have
in

Or
shall
we
sparingly
show
you
far
of
The
Dauphin
s
meaning
and
our
embassy
KING
HENRY
We
are
no
tyrant
but
a
Christian
king
Unto
whose
grace
our
passion
is
as
subject
As
are
our
wretches
fett
red
in
our
prisons
Therefore
with
frank
and
with
uncurbed
plainness
Tell
us
the
Dauphin
s
mind
AMBASSADOR
Thus
then
in
few
Your
Highness
lately
sending
into
France
Did
claim
some
certain
dukedoms
in
the
right
Of
your
great
predecessor
King
Edward
the
Third
In
answer
of
which
claim
the
Prince
our
master
Says
that
you
savour
too
much
of
your
youth
And
bids
you
be
advis
d
there
s
nought
in
France
That
can
be
with
a
nimble
galliard
won
You
cannot
revel
into
dukedoms
there
He
therefore
sends
you
meeter
for
your
spirit
This
tun
of
treasure
and
in
lieu
of
this
Desires
you
let
the
dukedoms
that
you
claim
Hear
no
more
of
you
This
the
Dauphin
speaks
KING
HENRY
What
treasure

EXETER
Tennis
balls
my
liege
KING
HENRY
We
are
glad
the
Dauphin
is
so
pleasant
with
us
His
present
and
your
pains
we
thank
you
for
When
we
have
match
d
our
rackets
to
these
balls
We
will
in
France
by
God
s
grace
play
a
set
Shall
strike
his
father
s
crown
into
the
hazard
Tell
him
he
hath
made
a
match
with
such
a
wrangler
That
all
the
courts
of
France
will
be
disturb
d
With
chaces
And
we
understand
him
well
How
he
comes
o
er
us
with
our
wilder
days
Not
measuring
what
use
we
made
of
them
We
never
valu
d
this
poor
seat
of
England
And
therefore
living
hence
did
give
ourself
To
barbarous
licence
as
tis
ever
common
That
men
are
merriest
when
they
are
from
home
But
tell
the
Dauphin
I
will
keep
my
state
Be
like
a
king
and
show
my
sail
of
greatness
When
I
do
rouse
me
in
my
throne
of
France
For
that
I
have
laid
by
my
majesty
And
plodded
like
a
man
for
working
days
But
I
will
rise
there
with
so
full
a
glory
That
I
will
dazzle
all
the
eyes
of
France
Yea
strike
the
Dauphin
blind
to
look
on
us
And
tell
the
pleasant
Prince
this
mock
of
his
Hath
turn
d
his
balls
to
gun
stones
and
his
soul
Shall
stand
sore
charged
for
the
wasteful
vengeance
That
shall
fly
with
them
for
many
a
thousand
widows
Shall
this
his
mock
mock
of
their
dear
husbands
Mock
mothers
from
their
sons
mock
castles
down
And
some
are
yet
ungotten
and
unborn
That
shall
have
cause
to
curse
the
Dauphin
s
scorn
But
this
lies
all
within
the
will
of
God
To
whom
I
do
appeal
and
in
whose
name
Tell
you
the
Dauphin
I
am
coming
on
To
venge
me
as
I
may
and
to
put
forth
My
rightful
hand
in
a
well
hallow
d
cause
So
get
you
hence
in
peace
and
tell
the
Dauphin
His
jest
will
savour
but
of
shallow
wit
When
thousands
weep
more
than
did
laugh
at
it
Convey
them
with
safe
conduct
Fare
you
well
Exeunt
AMBASSADORS
EXETER
This
was
a
merry
message
KING
HENRY
We
hope
to
make
the
sender
blush
at
it
Therefore
my
lords
omit
no
happy
hour
That
may
give
furth
rance
to
our
expedition
For
we
have
now
no
thought
in
us
but
France
Save
those
to
God
that
run
before
our
business
Therefore
let
our
proportions
for
these
wars
Be
soon
collected
and
all
things
thought
upon
That
may
with
reasonable
swiftness
ad
More
feathers
to
our
wings
for
God
before
We
ll
chide
this
Dauphin
at
his
father

Therefore
let
every

now
task
his
thought
That
this
fair

may
on
foot
be
brought

CHORUS
CHORUS
Now
all
the
youth
of
England
are
on
fire
And
silken
dalliance
in
the
wardrobe
lies
Now
thrive
the
armourers
and
honour
s
thought
Reigns
solely
in
the
breast
of
every
man
They
sell
the
pasture
now
to
buy
the
horse
Following
the
mirror
of
all
Christian
kings
With
winged
heels
as
English
Mercuries
For
now
sits
Expectation
in
the
air
And
hides
a
sword
from
hilts
unto
the
point
With
crowns
imperial
crowns
and
coronets
Promis
d
to
Harry
and
his
followers
The
French
advis
d
by
good
intelligence
Of
this
most
dreadful
preparation
Shake
in
their
fear
and
with
pale
policy
Seek
to
divert
the
English
purposes
O
England
model
to
thy
inward
greatness
Like
little
body
with
a
mighty
heart
What
mightst
thou
do
that
honour
would
thee
do
Were
all
thy
children
kind
and
natural
But
see
thy
fault
France
hath
in
thee
found
out
A
nest
of
hollow
bosoms
which
he
fills
With
treacherous
crowns
and
three
corrupted
men
One
Richard
Earl
of
Cambridge
and
the
second
Henry
Lord
Scroop
of
Masham
and
the
third
Sir
Thomas
Grey
knight
of
Northumberland
Have
for
the
gilt
of
France
O
guilt
indeed
Confirm
d
conspiracy
with
fearful
France
And
by
their
hands
this
grace
of
kings
must
die
If
hell
and
treason
hold
their
promises
Ere
he
take
ship
for
France
and
in
Southampton
Linger
your
patience
on
and
we
ll
digest
Th
abuse
of
distance

The
sum
is
paid
the
traitors
are
agreed
The
King
is
set
from
London
and
the
scene
Is
now
transported
gentles
to
Southampton
There
is
the
play
house
now
there
must
you
sit
And
thence
to
France
shall
we
convey
you
safe
And
bring
you
back
charming
the
narrow
seas
To
give
you
gentle
pass
for
if
we
may
We

not
offend
one

with
our
play
But
till
the
King
come
forth

Good

BARDOLPH
What

Ancient

yet
NYM
For
my
part
I
care
not
I
say
little
but
when
time
shall
serve
there
shall
be
smiles
but
that
shall
be
as
it
may
I
dare
not
fight
but
I
will
wink
and
hold
out
mine
iron
It
is
a
simple
one
but
what
though
It
will
toast
cheese
and
it
will
endure
cold
as
another
man
s
sword
will
and
there
s
an
end
BARDOLPH
I
will
bestow
a
breakfast
to
make
you

I
will

I
may
That

my
rest
that
is
the
rendezvous
of
it
BARDOLPH
It

certain

he
is
married

Nell

she
did
you
wrong
for
you
were
troth

NYM
I
cannot
tell
things
must
be

they
may
Men
may
sleep
and
they
may
have
their
throats
about
them
at
that
time
and
some
say
knives
have
edges
It
must
be
as
it
may
though
patience
be
a
tired
mare
yet
she
will
plod
There
must
be
conclusions
Well

WESTMORELAND
BEDFORD
Fore
God
his
Grace
is
bold
to
trust
these
traitors
EXETER
They
shall
be
apprehended
by
and
by
WESTMORELAND
How
smooth
and
even
they
do
bear
themselves
As
if
allegiance
in
their
bosoms
sat
Crowned
with
faith
and
constant
loyalty
BEDFORD
The
King
hath
note
of
all
that
they
intend
By
interception
which
they
dream
not
of
EXETER
Nay
but
the
man
that
was
his
bedfellow
Whom
he
hath
dull
d
and
cloy
d
with
gracious
favours
That
he
should
for
a
foreign
purse
so
sell
His
sovereign

life
to
death

treachery
Trumpets

GREY

KING
HENRY
Now
sits
the
wind
fair
and
we
will
aboard
My
Lord
of
Cambridge
and
my
kind
Lord
of
Masham
And
you
my
gentle
knight
give
me
your
thoughts
Think
you
not
that
the
pow
rs
we
bear
with
us
Will
cut
their
passage
through
the
force
of
France
Doing
the
execution
and
the
act
For
which
we
have
in
head
assembled
them
SCROOP
No
doubt
my
liege
if
each
man
do
his
best
KING
HENRY
I
doubt
not
that
since
we
are
well
persuaded
We
carry
not
a
heart
with
us
from
hence
That
grows
not
in
a
fair
consent
with
ours
Nor
leave
not
one
behind
that
doth
not
wish
Success
and
conquest
to
attend
on
us
CAMBRIDGE
Never
was
monarch
better
fear
d

lov

Than
is
your
Majesty
There
s
not
I
think
a
subject
That
sits
in
heart
grief
and
uneasines
Under
the
sweet
shade
of
your
government
GREY
True
those
that
were
your
father
s
enemies
Have
steep
d
their
galls
in
honey
and
do
serve
you
With
hearts
create
of
duty
and
of
zeal
KING
HENRY
We
therefore
have
great
cause
of
thankfulness
And
shall
forget
the
office
of
our
hand
Sooner
than
quittance
of
desert
and
merit
According
to
the
weight
and
worthiness
SCROOP
So
service
shall
with
steeled
sinews
toil
And
labour
shall
refresh
itself
with
hope
To
do
your
Grace
incessant
services
KING
HENRY
We
judge
no
less
Uncle
of
Exeter
Enlarge
the
man
committed
yesterday
That
rail
d
against

We
consider
It
was
excess
of

set
him
on
And
on

more
advice
we
pardon

That

O

CAMBRIDGE
So

GREY
Sir
You
show
great

After

KING

Alas

Are

If

When

Appear

Would

CAMBRIDGE
I
one
my

Your

So
did
you

We
will
aboard

Why
how
now

What
see
you

those
papers
that
you
lose
So
much
complexion
Look
ye
how
they
change
Their
cheeks
are
paper
Why
what
read
you
there
That
have
so
cowarded
and
chas
d
your
blood
Out
of
appearance
CAMBRIDGE
I
do
confess
my
fault
And
do
submit
me
to
your
Highness
mercy
GREY
SCROOP
To
which
we
all
appeal
KING
HENRY
The
mercy
that
was
quick
in
us
but
late
By
your
own
counsel
is
suppress
d
and
kill
d
You
must
not
dare
for
shame
to
talk
of
mercy
For
your
own
reasons
turn
into
your
bosoms
As
dogs
upon
their
masters
worrying
you
See
you
my
princes
and
my
noble
peers
These
English
monsters
My
Lord
of
Cambridge
here
You
know
how
apt
our
love
was
to
accord
To
furnish
him
with
an
appertinents
Belonging
to
his
honour
and
this
man
Hath
for
a
few
light
crowns
lightly
conspir
d
And
sworn
unto
the
practices
of
France
To
kill
us
here
in
Hampton
to
the
which
This
knight
no
less
for
bounty
bound
to
us
Than
Cambridge
is
hath
likewise
sworn
But
O
What
shall
I
say
to
thee
Lord
Scroop
thou
cruel
Ingrateful
savage
and
inhuman
creature
Thou
that
didst
bear
the
key
of
all
my
counsels
That
knew
st
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
That
almost
mightst
have
coin
d
me
into
gold
Wouldst
thou
have
practis
d
on
me
for
thy
use
May
it
be
possible
that
foreign
hire
Could
out
of
thee
extract
one
spark
of
evil
That
might
annoy
my
finger
Tis
so
strange
That
though
the
truth
of
it
stands
off
as
gross
As
black
and
white
my
eye
will
scarcely
see
it
Treason
and
murder
ever
kept
together
As
two
yoke
devils
sworn
to
either
s
purpose
Working
so
grossly
in
a
natural
cause
That
admiration
did
not
whoop
at
them
But
thou
gainst
all
proportion
didst
bring
in
Wonder
to
wait
on
treason
and
on
murder
And
whatsoever
cunning
fiend
it
was
That
wrought
upon
thee
so
preposterously
Hath
got
the
voice
in
hell
for
excellence
And
other
devils
that
suggest
by
treasons
Do
botch
and
bungle
up
damnation
With
patches
colours

with
forms
being
fetch
d
From
glist
ring
semblances
of
piety
But
he
that
temper
d
thee
bade
thee
stand
up
Gave
thee
no
instance
why
thou
shouldst
do
treason
Unless
to
dub
thee
with
the
name
of
traitor
If
that
same
demon
that
hath
gull
d
thee
thus
Should
with
his
lion
gait
walk
the
whole
world
He
might
return
to
vasty
Tartar
back
And
tell
the
legions
I
can
never
win
A
soul
so
easy
as
that
Englishman
s
O
how
hast
thou
with
jealousy
infected
The
sweetness
of
affiance
Show
men
dutiful
Why
so
didst
thou
Seem

grave
and
learned
Why
so
didst
thou
Come
they
of
noble
family
Why
so
didst
thou
Seem
they
religious
Why
so
didst
thou
Or
are
they
spare
in
diet
Free
from
gross
passion
or
of
mirth
or
anger
Constant
in
spirit
not
swerving

blood
Garnish

and
deck

in
modest
complement
Not
working
with
the
eye
without
the
ear
And
but
in
purged
judgment
trusting
neither
Such
and
so
finely
bolted
didst
thou
seem
And
thus
thy
fall
hath
left
a
kind
of
blot
To
mark
the
full
fraught
man
and
best
indued
With
some
suspicion
I
will
weep
for
thee
For
this
revolt
of
thine
methinks
is
like
Another
fall
of
man
Their
faults
are
open
Arrest
them
to
the
answer
of
the
law
And
God
acquit
them
of
their
practices
