To

I

a
neighbour

near

Bring

Where

PORTIA
In

I
am
not

By

direction
of

Besides
the

my
destiny
Bars
me
the
right
of
voluntary

But

me
by
his
wit

myself
His

my
fortune
By
this
scimitar
That
slew
the
Sophy
and
a
Persian

That

of
Sultan
Solyman
I
would

Outbrave
the
heart
most
daring

Pluck
the
young
sucking
cubs
from
the

Yea
mock
the
lion
when
a

for

To
win
thee
lady
But
alas

If
Hercules
and
Lichas

Which
is

May

Enter
LAUNCELOT
GOBBO
LAUNCELOT
Certainly
my
conscience
will
serve
me
to
run
from
this
Jew
my
master
The
fiend
is
at
mine
elbow
and
tempts
me
saying
to
me
Gobbo
Launcelot
Gobbo
good
Launcelot
or
good
Gobbo
or
good
Launcelot
Gobbo
use
your
legs
take
the
start
run
away
My
conscience
says
No
take
heed
honest
Launcelot
take
heed
honest
Gobbo
or
as
aforesaid
honest
Launcelot
Gobbo
do
not
run
scorn
running
with
thy
heels
Well
the
most
courageous
fiend
bids
me
pack
Via
says
the
fiend
away
says
the
fiend
For
the
heavens
rouse
up
a
brave
mind
says
the
fiend
and
run
Well
my
conscience
hanging
about
the
neck
of
my
heart
says
very
wisely
to
me
My
honest
friend
Launcelot
being
an
honest
man
s
son
or
rather
an
honest
woman
s
son
for
indeed
my
father
did
something
smack
something
grow
to
he
had
a
kind
of
taste
well
my
conscience
says
Launcelot
budge
not
Budge
says
the
fiend
Budge
not
says
my
conscience
Conscience
say
I
you
counsel
well
Fiend
say
I
you
counsel
well
To
be
rul
d
by
my
conscience
I
should
stay
with
the
Jew
my
master
who
God
bless
the
mark
is
a
kind
of
devil
and
to
run
away
from
the
Jew
I
should
be
ruled
by
the
fiend
who
saving
your
reverence
is
the
devil
himself
Certainly
the
Jew
is
the
very
devil
incarnation
and
in
my
conscience
my
conscience
is
but
a
kind
of
hard
conscience
to
offer
to
counsel
me
to
stay
with
the
Jew
The
fiend
gives
the
more
friendly
counsel
I
will
run
fiend
my
heels
are
at
your
commandment
I
will
run

an
honest
exceeding
poor
man
and

Of

Ergo
Master
Launcelot
Talk
not
of
Master
Launcelot
father
for
the
young
gentleman
according
to
Fates
and
Destinies
and
such
odd
sayings
the
Sisters
Three
and
such
branches
of
learning
is
indeed
deceased
or
as
you
would
say
in
plain
terms
gone

GOBBO
Marry
God
forbid
The

was
the
very
staff
of
my
age

Do

LAUNCELOT
Do
you
not

father
GOBBO
Alack
sir
I
am
sand
blind
I
know
you
not
LAUNCELOT
Nay
indeed
if
you
had
your
eyes
you
might
fail
of
the
knowing
me
it
is
a
wise
father
that
knows
his
own
child
Well
old
man
I
will
tell
you
news
of
your
son
Give
me
your
blessing
truth
will
come
to
light
murder
cannot
be

long
a

may
but
in
the
end
truth
will

GOBBO
Pray
you
sir
stand
up
I
am
sure
you
are
not
Launcelot
my
boy
LAUNCELOT
Pray
you
let
s
have
no
more
fooling
about
it
but
give
me
your
blessing
I
am
Launcelot
your
boy
that
was
your
son
that
is
your
child
that
shall
be
GOBBO
I
cannot
think
you
are
my
son
LAUNCELOT
I
know
not
what
I
shall
think
of
that
but
I
am
Launcelot
the
Jew
s
man
and
I
am
sure
Margery
your
wife
is
my
mother
GOBBO
Her
name
is
Margery
indeed

ll
be
sworn
if
thou
be
Launcelot
thou
art
mine
own
flesh
and
blood
Lord
worshipp
d
might
he
be
what
a
beard
hast
thou
got
Thou
hast
got
more
hair
on
thy
chin
than
Dobbin
my
fill
horse
has
on
his
tail
LAUNCELOT
It
should
seem
then
that
Dobbin
s
tail
grows
backward
I
am
sure
he
had
more
hair
of
his
tail
than
I
have
of
my
face
when
I
last
saw
him
GOBBO
Lord
how
art
thou
chang
d
How
dost
thou
and
thy
master
agree
I
have
brought
him
a
present
How
gree
you
now
LAUNCELOT
Well
well
but
for
mine
own
part
as
I
have
set
up
my
rest
to
run
away
so
I
will
not
rest
till
I
have
run

My
master

a
very
Jew
Give

a
present
Give
him
a
halter
I
am
famish
d
in
his
service

Father
I
am
glad
you
are
come
give
me
your
present
to
one
Master
Bassanio
who
indeed
gives
rare
new
liveries
if
I
serve
not
him
I
will
run
as
far
as
God
has
any
ground
O
rare
fortune
Here
comes
the
man
To
him
father
for
I
am
a
Jew
if
I
serve
the
Jew
any
longer
Enter
BASSANIO
with
LEONARDO
with
a
FOLLOWER
or
two
BASSANIO
You
may
do
so
but

See

Exit

GOBBO
God

your
worship
BASSANIO
Gramercy
wouldst
thou
aught
with
me
GOBBO
Here
s
my
son
sir
a
poor
boy
LAUNCELOT
Not
a
poor
boy
sir
but
the
rich
Jew
s
man
that
would
sir
as
my
father
shall
specify
GOBBO
He
hath
a
great
infection
sir
as
one
would
say
to
serve
LAUNCELOT
Indeed
the
short
and
the
long
is
I
serve
the
Jew
and
have
a
desire
as
my
father
shall
specify
GOBBO
His
master
and
he
saving
your
worship
s
reverence
are
scarce
cater
cousins
LAUNCELOT
To
be
brief
the
very
truth
is
that
the
Jew
having
done
me
wrong
doth
cause
me
as
my
father
being
I
hope
an
old
man
shall
frutify
unto
you
GOBBO
I
have
here
a
dish
of
doves
that
I
would
bestow
upon
your
worship
and
my
suit
is
LAUNCELOT
In
very
brief
the
suit
is
impertinent
to
myself
as
your
worship
shall
know
by
this
honest
old
man
and
though
I
say
it
though
old
man
yet
poor
man
my
father
BASSANIO
One
speak
for
both
What
would
you
LAUNCELOT
Serve
you
sir
GOBBO
That
is
the
very
defect
of
the
matter
sir
BASSANIO
I
know
thee
well
thou
hast
obtain
d
thy
suit
Shylock
thy
master
spoke
with
me
this
day
And
hath
preferr
d
thee
if
it
be
preferment
To
leave
a
rich
Jew
s
service
to
become
The
follower
of
so
poor
a
gentleman
LAUNCELOT
The
old
proverb
is
very
well
parted
between
my
master
Shylock
and
you
sir
you
have
the
grace
of
God
sir
and
he
hath
enough
BASSANIO
Thou
speak
st
it
well
Go
father
with
thy
son
Take
leave
of
thy
old
master
and
inquire
My
lodging
out
To
a
SERVANT
Give
him
a
livery
More
guarded
than
his
fellows
see
it
done
LAUNCELOT
Father
in
I
cannot
get
a
service
no
I
have
ne
er
a
tongue

my
head
Looking
on
his
palm
Well
if
any
man
in
Italy
have
a
fairer
table
which
doth
offer
to
swear
upon
a
book
I
shall
have
good
fortune
Go
to

a
simple
line
of
life
here
s
a
small
trifle
of
wives
alas
fifteen
wives

nothing
a
leven
widows
and
nine
maids
is
a
simple
coming
in
for
one
man
And
then
to
scape
drowning
thrice
and
to
be
in
peril
of
my
life
with
the
edge
of
a
feather

here
are
simple
scapes
Well
if
Fortune

The

Jessica
my
girl
Look
to
my

I
am
right
loath

I
beseech

your

So

And
they
have
conspired
together
I
will
not
say
you
shall
see
a
masque
but
if
you

it
was
not

Hear

Jessica
Lock

And
the
vile
squealing
of

Clamber
not
you
up
to
the
casements
then
Nor
thrust
your
head
into

To

Farewell

SHYLOCK
The

Snail
slow
in
profit
and
he
sleeps
by

More

Therefore
I
part
with
him
and
part
with

To
one

His

Well

Perhaps
I

Do
