In
brief

the

Prepare
thy

thy
fortune
to
the
arbitrement
Of
bloody
strokes
and
mortal
staring
war
I
as
I
may
that
which
I
would
I
cannot
With
best
advantage
will
deceive
the
time
And
aid
thee
in
this
doubtful
shock
of
arms
But
on
thy
side
I
may
not
be
too
forward
Lest
being
seen
thy
brother
tender
George
Be
executed
in
his
father

sight
Farewell
the
leisure
and
the
fearful
time
Cuts

And
ample

of
sweet
discourse
Which
so
long
sund
red

should
dwell
upon

of

Samp
A

To

sense
that
feel
it
Samp
Me
