So

Nor

About

Have

I

Of

thy

Did

His

No

Unless

Bereft

Of

BUSHY
Madam
your

You

To
lay
aside

harming
heaviness
And
entertain
a
cheerful
disposition
QUEEN
To
please
the

I
did
to
please
myself
I
cannot
do
it

I
know
no
cause
Why
I
should
welcome
such
a
guest
as
grief
Save
bidding
farewell
to
so
sweet
a
guest
As
my
sweet
Richard
Yet
again
methinks
Some
unborn
sorrow
ripe
in
fortune
s
womb
Is
coming
towards
me
and
my
inward
soul
With
nothing
trembles
At
some
thing
it
grieves
More
than
with
parting
from
my
lord
the
King
BUSHY
Each
substance
of
a
grief
hath
twenty
shadows
Which
shows
like
grief
itself
but
is
not
so
For
sorrow
s
eye
glazed
with
blinding
tears
Divides
one
thing
entire
to
many
objects
Like
perspectives
which
rightly
gaz
d
upon
Show
nothing
but
confusion

d
awry
Distinguish

So
your
sweet
Majesty
Looking
awry
upon
your
lord
s
departure
Find
shapes
of
grief
more
than
himself
to
wail
Which
look
d
on
as
it
is
is
nought
but
shadows
Of
what
it
is
not
Then
thrice
gracious
Queen
More
than
your

departure
weep
not
more
is
not

Or
if
it

with

Which
for

weeps

It
may
be
so

my

Persuades

Howe

cannot
but
be
sad
so
heavy
sad
As
though
on

Makes

Well

Come

The
wind
sits
fair
for
news
to
go
to
Ireland
But
none
returns
For
us
to
levy
power
Proportionable
to
the
enemy
Is
all
unpossible
GREEN
Besides
our
nearness
to
the
King
in
love
Is
near
the
hate
of
those

not
the
King
BAGOT
And
that
is
the
wavering
commons
for
their
love
Lies
in
their
purses

whoso
empties
them
By
so
much
fills
their
hearts
with
deadly
hate

Wherein

Because

Well
I

The

Thither

Gloucestershire
Enter
BOLINGBROKE
and
NORTHUMBERLAND
forces
BOLINGBROKE
How
far
is
it
my
lord
to
Berkeley
now
NORTHUMBERLAND
Believe
me
noble
lord
I
am
a
stranger
here
in
Gloucestershire
These
high
wild
hills
and
rough
uneven
ways
Draws
out
our
miles
and
makes
them
wearisome
And
yet
your
fair
discourse
hath
been
as
sugar
Making
the
hard
way
sweet
and
delectable
But
I
bethink
me
what
a
weary
way
From
Ravenspurgh
to
Cotswold
will
be
found
In
Ross
and
Willoughby
wanting
your
company
Which
I
protest
hath
very
much
beguil
d
The
tediousness
and
process
of
my
travel
But
theirs
is
sweet
ned
with
the
hope
to
have
The
present
benefit
which
I
possess
And
hope
to
joy
is
little
less
in
joy
Than
hope
enjoy
d
By
this
the
weary
lords
Shall
make
their
way
seem
short
as
mine
hath
done
By
sight
of
what
I
have
your
noble
company
BOLINGBROKE
Of
much
less
value
is
my
company
Than
your
good
words
But
who
comes
here
Enter
HARRY
PERCY
NORTHUMBERLAND
It
is
my
son
young
Harry
Percy
Sent
from
my
brother
Worcester
whencesoever
Harry
how
fares
your
uncle
PERCY
I
had
thought
my
lord
to
have
learn
d
his
health
of
you
NORTHUMBERLAND
Why
is
he
not
with
the
Queen
PERCY
No
my
good
lord
he
hath
forsook
the
court
Broken
his
staff
of
office
and
dispers
d
The
household
of
the
King
NORTHUMBERLAND
What
was
his
reason
He
was
not
so
resolv
d
when
last
we
spake
together
PERCY
Because
your
lordship
was
proclaimed
traitor
But
he
my
lord
is
gone
to
Ravenspurgh
To
offer
service
to
the
Duke
of
Hereford
And
sent
me
over
by
Berkeley
to
discover
What
power
the
Duke
of
York
had
levied
there
Then
with
directions
to
repair
to
Ravenspurgh
NORTHUMBERLAND
Have
you
forgot
the
Duke
of
Hereford
boy
PERCY
No
my
good
lord
for
that
is
not
forgot
Which
ne
er
I
did
remember
to
my
knowledge
I
never
in
my
life
did
look
on
him
NORTHUMBERLAND
Then
learn
to
know
him
now
this
is
the
Duke
PERCY
My
gracious
lord
I
tender
you
my
service
Such
as
it
is
being
tender
raw
and
young
Which
elder
days
shall
ripen
and
confirm
To
more
approved
service
and
desert
BOLINGBROKE
I
thank
thee
gentle
Percy
and
be
sure
I
count
myself
in
nothing
else
so
happy
As
in
a
soul
rememb
ring
my
good
friends
And
as
my
fortune
ripens
with
thy
love
It
shall
be
still
thy
true
love
s
recompense
My
heart
this
covenant
makes
my
hand
thus
seals
it
NORTHUMBERLAND
How
far
is
it
to
Berkeley
And
what
stir
Keeps
good
old
York
there
with
his
men
of
war
PERCY
There
stands
the
castle
by
yon
tuft
of
trees
Mann
d
with
three
hundred
men
as
I
have
heard
And
in
it
are
the
Lords
of
York
Berkeley
and
Seymour
None
else
of
name
and
noble
estimate
Enter
Ross
and
WILLOUGHBY
NORTHUMBERLAND
Here
come
the
Lords
of
Ross
and
Willoughby
Bloody
with
spurring
fiery
red
with
haste
BOLINGBROKE
Welcome
my
lords
I
wot
your
love
pursues
A
banish
d
traitor
All
my
treasury
Is
yet
but
unfelt
thanks
which
more
enrich
d
Shall
be
your
love
and
labour
s
recompense
ROSS
Your
presence
makes
us
rich
most
noble
lord
WILLOUGHBY
And
far
surmounts
our
labour
to
attain
it
BOLINGBROKE
Evermore
thanks
the
exchequer
of
the
poor
Which
till
my
infant
fortune
comes
to
years
Stands
for
my
bounty
But
who
comes
here
Enter
BERKELEY
NORTHUMBERLAND
It
is
my
Lord
of
Berkeley
as
I
guess
BERKELEY
My
Lord
of
Hereford
my
message
is
to
you
BOLINGBROKE
My
lord
my
answer
is
to
Lancaster
And
I
am
come
to
seek
that
name
in
England
And
I
must
find
that
title
in
your
tongue
Before
I
make
reply
to
aught
you
say
BERKELEY
Mistake
me
not
my
lord
tis
not
my
meaning
To
raze
one
title
of
your
honour
out
To
you
my
lord
I
come
what
lord
you
will
From
the
most
gracious
regent
of
this
land
The
Duke
of
York
to
know
what
pricks
you
on
To
take
advantage
of
the
absent
time
And
fright
our
native
peace
with
self
borne
arms
Enter
YORK
attended
BOLINGBROKE
I
shall
not
need
transport
my
words
by
you
Here
comes
his
Grace
in
person
My
noble
uncle
Kneels
YORK
Show
me
thy
humble
heart
and
not
thy
knee
Whose
duty
is
deceivable
and
false
BOLINGBROKE
My
gracious
uncle
YORK
Tut
tut
Grace
me
no
grace
nor
uncle
me
no
uncle
I
am
no
traitor
s
uncle
and
that
word
grace
In
an
ungracious
mouth
is
but
profane
Why
have
those
banish
d
and
forbidden
legs
Dar
d
once
to
touch
a
dust
of
England
s
ground
But
then
more
why
why
have
they
dar
d
to
march
So
many
miles
upon
her
peaceful
bosom
Frighting
her
pale
fac
d
villages
with
war
And
ostentation
of
despised
arms
Com
st
thou
because
the
anointed
King
is
hence
Why
foolish
boy
the
King
is
left
behind
And
in
my
loyal
bosom
lies
his
power
Were
I
but
now
lord
of
such
hot
youth
As
when
brave
Gaunt
thy
father
and
myself
Rescued
the
Black
Prince
that
young
Mars
of
men
From
forth
the
ranks
of
many
thousand
French
O
then
how
quickly
should
this
arm
of
mine
Now
prisoner
to
the
palsy
chastise
the
And
minister
correction
to
thy
fault
BOLINGBROKE
My
gracious
uncle
let
me
know
my
fault
On
what
condition
stands
it
and
wherein
YORK
Even
in
condition
of
the
worst
degree
In
gross
rebellion
and
detested
treason
Thou
art
a
banish
d
man
and
here
art
come
Before
the
expiration
of
thy
time
In
braving
arms
against
thy
sovereign
BOLINGBROKE
As
I
was
banish
d
I
was
banish
d
Hereford
But
as
I
come
I
come
for
Lancaster
And
noble
uncle
I
beseech
your
Grace
Look
on
my
wrongs
with
an
indifferent
eye
You
are
my
father
for
methinks
in
you
I
see
old
Gaunt
alive
O
then
my
father
Will
you
permit
that
I
shall
stand
condemn
d
A
wandering
vagabond
my
rights
and
royalties
Pluck
d
from
my
arms
perforce
and
given
away
To
upstart
unthrifts
Wherefore
was
I
born
