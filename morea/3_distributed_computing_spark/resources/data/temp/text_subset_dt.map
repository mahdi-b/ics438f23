I
hope
she
will
deserve
well
and
a
little
To
love
her
for
her
mother
s
sake
that
lov
d
him
Heaven
knows
how
dearly
My
next
poor
petition
Is
that
his
noble
Grace
would
have
some
pity
Upon
my
wretched
women
that
so
long
Have
follow
d
both
my
fortunes
faithfully
Of
which
there
is
not
one
I
dare
avow
And
now
I
should
not
lie
but
will
deserve
For
virtue
and
true
beauty
of
the
soul
For
honesty
and
decent
carriage
A
right
good
husband
let
him
be
a
noble
And
sure
those
men
are
happy
that
shall
have
em
The
last
is
for
my
men
they
are
the
poorest
But
poverty
could
never
draw
em
from
me
That
they
may
have
their
wages
duly
paid
em
And
something
over
to
remember
me
by
If
heaven
had
pleas
d
to
have
given
me
longer
life
And
able
means
we
had
not
parted
thus
These
are
the
whole
contents
and
good
my
lord
By
that
you
love
the
dearest
in
this
world
As
you
wish
Christian
peace
to
souls
departed
Stand
these
poor
people
s
friend
and
urge
the
King
To
do
me
this
last
right
CAPUCIUS
By
heaven
I
will
Or
let
me
lose

fashion
of
a

dangerous
which
are
heresies
And
not
reform
d
may
prove
pernicious
GARDINER
Which
reformation
must
be
sudden
too
My
noble
lords
for
those
that
tame
wild
horses
Pace
em
not
in
their
hands
to
make
em
gentle
But
stop
their
mouth
with
stubborn
bits
and
spur
em
Till
they
obey
the
manage
If
we
suffer
Out
of
our
easiness
and
childish
pity
To
one
man
s
honour
this
contagious
sickness
Farewell
all
physic
and
what
follows
then
Commotions
uproars
with
a
general
taint
Of
the
whole
state
as
of
late
days
our
neighbours
The
upper
Germany
can
dearly
witness
Yet
freshly
pitied
in
our
memories
CRANMER
My
good
lords
hitherto
in
all
the
progress
Both
of
my
life
and
office
I
have
labour
d
And
with
no
little
study
that
my
teaching
And
the
strong
course
of
my
authority
Might
go
one
way
and
safely
and
the
end
Was
ever
to
do
well
Nor
is
there
living
I
speak
it
with
a
single
heart
my
lords
A
man
that
more
detests
more
stirs
against
Both
in
his
private
conscience
and
his
place
Defacers
of
a
public
peace
than
I
do
Pray
heaven
the
King
may
never
find
a
heart
With
less
allegiance
in
it
Men
that
make
Envy
and
crooked
malice
nourishment
Dare
bite
the
best
I
do
beseech
your
lordships
That
in
this
case
of
justice
my
accusers
Be
what
they
will
may
stand
forth
face
to
face
And
freely
urge
against
me
SUFFOLK
Nay
my
lord
That
cannot
be
you
are
a
councillor
And
by
that
virtue
no
man
dare
accuse
you
GARDINER
My
lord
because
we
have
business
of
more
moment
We
will
be
short
with
you
Tis
his
Highness
pleasure
And
our
consent
for
better
trial
of
you
From
hence
you
be
committed
to
the
Tower
Where
being
but
a
private
man
again
You
shall
know
many
dare
accuse
you
boldly
More
than
I
fear
you
are
provided
for
CRANMER
Ah
my
good
Lord
of
Winchester
I
thank
you
You
are
always
my
good
friend
if
your
will
pass
I
shall
both
find
your
lordship
judge
and
juror
You
are
so
merciful
I
see
your
end
Tis
my
undoing
Love
and
meekness
lord
Become
a
churchman
better
than
ambition
Win
straying
souls
with
modesty
again
Cast
none
away
That
I
shall
clear
myself
Lay
all
the
weight
ye
can
upon
my
patience
I
make
as
little
doubt
as
you
do
conscience
In
doing
daily
wrongs
I
could
say
more
But
reverence
to
your
calling
makes
me
modest
GARDINER
My
lord
my
lord
you
are
a
sectary
That
s
the
plain
truth
Your
painted
gloss
discovers
To
men
that
understand
you
words
and
weakness
CROMWELL
My
Lord
of
Winchester
y
are
a
little
By
your
good
favour
too
sharp
men
so
noble
However
faulty
yet
should
find
respect
For
what
they
have
been
tis
a
cruelty
To
load
a
falling
man
GARDINER
Good
Master
Secretary
I
cry
your
honour
mercy
you
may
worst
Of
all
this
table
say
so
CROMWELL
Why
my
lord
GARDINER
Do
not
I
know
you
for
a
favourer
Of
this
new
sect
Ye
are
not
sound
CROMWELL
Not
sound
GARDINER
Not
sound
I
say
CROMWELL
Would
you
were
half
so
honest
Men
s
prayers
then
would
seek
you
not
their
fears
GARDINER
I
shall
remember
this
bold
language
CROMWELL
Do
Remember
your
bold
life
too
CHANCELLOR
This
is
too
much
Forbear
for
shame
my
lords
GARDINER
I
have
done
CROMWELL
And
I
CHANCELLOR
Then
thus
for
you
my
lord
it
stands
agreed
I
take
it
by
all
voices
that
forthwith
You
be
convey
d
to
th
Tower
a
prisoner
There
to
remain
till
the
King
s
further
pleasure
Be
known
unto
us
Are
you
all
agreed
lords
ALL
We
are
CRANMER
Is
there
no
other
way
of
mercy
But
I
must
needs
to
th
Tower
my
lords
GARDINER
What
other
Would
you
expect
You
are
strangely
troublesome
Let
some
o
th
guard
be
ready
there
Enter
the
guard
CRANMER
For
me
Must
I
go
like
a
traitor
thither
GARDINER
Receive
him
And
see
him
safe
i
th
Tower
CRANMER
Stay
good
my
lords
I
have
a
little
yet
to
say
Look
there
my
lords
By
virtue
of
that
ring
I
take
my
cause
Out
of
the
gripes
of
cruel
men
and
give
it
To
a
most
noble
judge
the
King
my
master
CHAMBERLAIN
This
is
the
King
s
ring
SURREY
Tis
no
counterfeit
SUFFOLK
Tis
the
right
ring
by
heav
n
I
told
ye
all
When
we
first
put
this
dangerous
stone
a
rolling
Twould
fall
upon
ourselves
NORFOLK
Do
you
think
my
lords
The
King
will
suffer
but
the
little
finger
Of
this
man
to
be
vex
d
CHAMBERLAIN
Tis
now
too
certain
How
much
more
is
his
life
in
value
with
him
Would
I
were
fairly
out
on
t
CROMWELL
My
mind
gave
me
In
seeking
tales
and
informations
Against
this
man
whose
honesty
the
devil
And
his
disciples
only
envy
at
Ye
blew
the
fire
that
burns
ye
Now
have
at
ye
Enter
the
KING
frowning
on
them
he
takes
his
seat
GARDINER
Dread
sovereign
how
much
are
we
bound
to
heaven
In
daily
thanks
that
gave
us
such
a
prince
Not
only
good
and
wise
but
most
religious
One
that
in
all
obedience
makes
the
church
The
chief
aim
of
his
honour
and
to
strengthen
That
holy
duty
out
of
dear
respect
His
royal
self
in
judgment
comes
to
hear
The
cause
betwixt
her
and
this
great
offender
KING
You
were
ever
good
at
sudden
commendations
Bishop
of
Winchester
But
know
I
come
not
To
hear
such
flattery
now
and
in
my
presence
They
are
too
thin
and
bare
to
hide
offences
To
me
you
cannot
reach
you
play
the
spaniel
And
think
with
wagging
of
your
tongue
to
win
me
But
whatsoe
er
thou
tak
st
me
for
I
m
sure
Thou
hast
a
cruel
nature
and
a
bloody
To
CRANMER
Good
man
sit
down
Now
let
me
see
the
proudest
He
that
dares
most
but
wag
his
finger
at
thee
By
all
that
s
holy
he
had
better
starve
Than
but
once
think
this
place
becomes
thee
not
SURREY
May
it
please
your
Grace
KING
No
sir
it
does
not
please
me
I
had
thought
I
had
had
men
of
some
understanding
And
wisdom
of
my
Council
but
I
find
none
Was
it
discretion
lords
to
let
this
man
This
good
man
few
of
you
deserve
that
title
This
honest
man
wait
like
a
lousy
footboy
At
chamber
door
and
one
as
great
as
you
are
Why
what
a
shame
was
this
Did
my
commission
Bid
ye
so
far
forget
yourselves
I
gave
ye
Power
as
he
was
a
councillor
to
try
him
Not
as
a
groom
There
s
some
of
ye
I
see
More
out
of
malice
than
integrity
Would
try
him
to
the
utmost
had
ye
mean
Which
ye
shall
never
have
while
I
live
CHANCELLOR
Thus
far
My
most
dread
sovereign
may
it
like
your
Grace
To
let
my
tongue
excuse
all
What
was
purpos
d
concerning
his
imprisonment
was
rather
