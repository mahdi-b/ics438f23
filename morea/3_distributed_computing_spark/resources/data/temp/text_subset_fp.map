Now
fair
Hippolyta
our
nuptial

Draws

apace
four
happy
days
bring
in
Another
moon
but
O
methinks
how
slow
This
old
moon
wanes
She
lingers
my
desires
Like
to
a
step

or
a
dowager
Long
withering
out

HIPPOLYTA
Four
days
will
quickly
steep
themselves

Four
nights
will
quickly
dream
away

And
then
the
moon
like

silver
bow
New
bent
in

shall
behold
the
night
Of
our
solemnities
THESEUS
Go
Philostrate
Stir
up
the
Athenian
youth
to
merriments
Awake
the
pert

nimble
spirit
of
mirth
Turn
melancholy

Full

Against

Stand

My
noble

This

consent

Stand

Lysander
And
my
gracious
Duke
This
man
hath
bewitch

the
bosom
of
my
child
Thou
thou
Lysander
thou
hast
given
her
rhymes
And
interchang
d
love
tokens
with
my
child
Thou
hast
by
moonlight
at
her
window
sung
With
feigning
voice
verses
of
feigning

And
stol

the
impression
of
her
fantasy
With
bracelets
of
thy

Knacks

Of
strong
prevailment
in
unhardened

With

my

Turn
d
her
obedience
which
is
due
to
me
To
stubborn
harshness
And
my
gracious
Duke
Be
it
so
she
will
not
here
before
your
Grace
Consent
to
marry
with
Demetrius
I
beg
the
ancient
privilege
of
Athens
As
she
is
mine
I
may
dispose
of
her
Which
shall
be
either
to
this
gentleman
Or
to
her
death
according
to
our
law
Immediately
provided
in
that
case
THESEUS
What
say
you
Hermia
Be
advis
d
fair
maid
To
you
your
father
should
be
as
a
god
One
that
compos
d
your
beauties
yea
and
one
To
whom
you
are
but
as
a
form
in
wax
By
him
imprinted
and
within
his
power
To
leave
the
figure
or
disfigure
it
Demetrius
is
a
worthy
gentleman
HERMIA
So
is
Lysander
THESEUS
In
himself
he
is
But
in
this
kind
wanting
your
father
s
voice
The
other
must
be
held
the
worthier
HERMIA
I
would
my
father
look
d
but
with
my
eyes
THESEUS
Rather
your
eyes
must
with
his
judgment
look
HERMIA
I
do
entreat
your
Grace
to
pardon
me
I
know
not
by
what
power
I
am
made
bold
Nor
how
it
may
concern
my
modesty
In
such
a
presence
here
to
plead
my
thoughts
But
I
beseech
your
Grace
that
I
may
know
The
worst
that
may
befall
me
in
this
case
If
I
refuse
to
wed
Demetrius
THESEUS
Either
to
die
the
death
or
to
abjure
For
ever
the
society
of
men
Therefore
fair
Hermia
question
your
desires
Know
of
your
youth
examine
well
your
blood
Whether
if
you
yield
not
to
your
father
s
choice
You
can
endure
the
livery
of
a
nun
For
aye
to
be
shady
cloister
mew
d
To
live
a
barren
sister
all
your
life
Chanting
faint
hymns
to
the
cold
fruitless
moon
Thrice
blessed
they
that
master
so
their
blood
To
undergo
such
maiden
pilgrimage
But
earthlier
happy
is
the
rose
distill
d
Than
that
which
withering
on
the
virgin
thorn
Grows
lives
and
dies
in
single
blessedness
HERMIA
So
will
I
grow
so
live
so
die
my
lord
Ere
I
will
yield
my
virgin
patent
up
Unto
his
lordship
whose
unwished
yoke
My
soul
consents
not
to
give
sovereignty
THESEUS
Take
time
to
pause
and
by
the
next
new
moon
The
sealing
day
betwixt
my
love
and
me
For
everlasting
bond
of
fellowship
Upon
that
day
either
prepare
to
die
For
disobedience
to
your
father
s
will
Or
else
to
wed
Demetrius
as
he
would
Or
on
Diana
s
altar
to
protest
For
aye
austerity
and
single
life
DEMETRIUS
Relent
sweet
Hermia
and
Lysander
yield
Thy
crazed
title
to
my
certain
right
LYSANDER
You

Let

EGEUS
Scornful
Lysander
true

my

And
what
is
mine
my
love
shall
render
him
And
she
is
mine

my
right

Demetrius
LYSANDER
I

My

And
which
is
more
than
all
these
boasts
can

I

of
beauteous
Hermia
Why
should
not
I
then
prosecute
my
right
Demetrius
I

Made

And
won

sweet
lady
dotes
Devoutly
dotes
dotes
in
idolatry
Upon
this
spotted
and
inconstant
man
THESEUS
I
must
confess
that
I
have
heard
so
much
And
with
Demetrius
thought
to
have
spoke
thereof
But
being
over
full
of
self
affairs
My
mind
did
lose
it
But
Demetrius
come
And
come
Egeus
you
shall
go
with
me
I
have
some
private
schooling
for
you
both
For
you
fair
Hermia
look
you
arm
yourself
To
fit
your
fancies
to
your
father
s
will
Or
else
the
law
of
Athens
yields
you
up
Which
by
no
means
we
may
extenuate
To
death
or
to
a
vow
of
single
life
Come
my
Hippolyta
what
cheer
my
love
Demetrius
and
Egeus
go
along
I
must
employ
you
in
some
business
Against
our
nuptial
and
confer
with
you
Of
something
nearly
that
concerns
yourselves
EGEUS
With
duty
and
desire
we
follow
you
Exeunt
all
but
LYSANDER
and
HERMIA
LYSANDER
How
now
my
love
Why
is
your
cheek
so
pale
How
chance
the
roses
there
do
fade
so
fast
HERMIA
Belike
for
want
of
rain
which
I
could
well
Beteem
them
from
the
tempest
of
my
eyes
LYSANDER
Ay
me
for
aught
that
I
could
ever
read
Could
ever
hear
by
tale
or
history
The
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
But
either
it
was
different
in
blood
HERMIA
O
cross
too
high
to
be
enthrall
d
to
low
LYSANDER
Or
else
misgraffed
in
respect
of
years
HERMIA
O
spite
too
old
to
be
engag
d
to
young
LYSANDER
Or
else
it
stood
upon
the
choice
of
friends
HERMIA
O
hell
to
choose
love
by
another
s
eyes
LYSANDER
Or
if
there
were
a
sympathy
in
choice
War
death
or
sickness
did
lay
siege
to
it
Making
it
momentary
as
a
sound
Swift
as
a
shadow
short
as
any
dream
Brief
as
the
lightning
in
the
collied
night
That
in
a
spleen
unfolds
both
heaven
and
earth
And
ere
a
man
hath
power
to
say
Behold
The
jaws
of
darkness
do
devour
it
up
So
quick
bright
things
come
to
confusion
HERMIA
If
then
true
lovers
have
ever
cross
d
It
stands
as
an
edict
in
destiny
Then
let
us
teach
our
trial
patience
Because
it
is
a
customary
cross
As
due
to
love
as
thoughts
and
dreams
and
sighs
Wishes
and
tears
poor
Fancy
s
followers
LYSANDER
A
good
persuasion
therefore
hear
me
Hermia
I
have
a
widow
aunt
a
dowager
Of
great
revenue
and
she
hath
no
child
From
Athens
is
her
house
remote
seven
leagues
And
she
respects
me
as
her
only
son
There
gentle
Hermia
may
I
marry
thee
And
to
that
place
the
sharp
Athenian
law
Cannot
pursue
us
If
thou
lovest
me
then
Steal
forth
thy
father
s
house
to
morrow
night
And
in
the
wood
a
league
without
the
town
Where
I
did
meet
thee
once
with
Helena
To
do
observance
to
a
morn
of
May
There
will
I
stay
for
thee
HERMIA
My
good
Lysander
I
swear
to
thee
by
Cupid
s
strongest
bow
By
his
best
arrow
with
the
golden
head
By
the
simplicity
of
Venus
doves
By
that
which
knitteth
souls
and
prospers
loves
And
by
that
fire
which
burn
d
the
Carthage
Queen
When
the
false
Troyan
under
sail
was
seen
By
all
the
vows
that
ever
men
have
broke
In
number
more
than
ever
women
spoke
In

place
thou
hast

fair
again
unsay
Demetrius
loves
your
fair
O
happy
fair
Your
eyes
are
lode
stars
and
your
tongue
s
sweet
air
More
tuneable
than
lark
to
shepherd
s
ear
When
wheat
is
green
when
hawthorn
buds
appear
Sickness
is
catching
O
were
favour
so
Yours
would
I
catch
fair
Hermia
ere
I
go
My
ear
should
catch
your
voice
my
eye
your
eye
My
tongue
should
catch
your
tongue
s
sweet
melody
Were
the
world
mine
Demetrius
being
bated
The
rest
I
d
give
to
be
to
you
translated
O
teach
me
how
you
look
and
with
what
art
You
sway
the
motion
of
Demetrius
heart
HERMIA
I
frown
upon
him
yet
he
loves
me
still
HELENA
O
that
your
frowns
would
teach
my
smiles
such
skill
HERMIA
I
give
him
curses
yet
he
gives
me
love
HELENA
O
that
my
prayers
could
such
affection
move
HERMIA
The
more
I
hate
the
more
he
follows
me
HELENA
The
more
I
love
the
more
he
hateth
me
HERMIA
His
folly
Helena
is
no
fault
of
mine
HELENA
None
but
your
beauty
would
that
fault
were
mine
HERMIA
Take
comfort
he
no
more
shall
see
my
face
Lysander
and
myself
will
fly
this
place
Before
the
time
I
did
Lysander
see
Seem
d
Athens
as
a
paradise
to
me
O
then
what
graces
in
my
love
do
dwell
That
he
hath
turn
d
a
heaven
unto
a
hell
LYSANDER
Helen
to
you
our
minds
we
will
unfold
To
morrow
night
when
Phoebe
doth
behold
Her
silver
visage
in
the
wat
ry
glass
Decking
with
liquid
pearl
the
bladed
grass
A
time
that
lovers
flights
doth
still
conceal
Through
Athens
gates
have
we
devis
d
to
steal
HERMIA
And
in
the
wood
where
often
you
and
I
Upon
faint
primrose
beds
were
wont
to
lie
Emptying
our
bosoms
of
their
counsel
sweet
There
my
Lysander
and
myself
shall
meet
And
thence
from
Athens
turn
away
our
eyes
To
seek
new
friends
and
stranger
companies
Farewell
sweet
playfellow
pray
thou
for
us
And
good
luck
grant
thee
thy
Demetrius
Keep
word
Lysander
we
must
starve
our
sight
From
lovers
food
till
morrow
deep
midnight
LYSANDER
I
will
my
Hermia
Exit
HERMIA
Helena
adieu
As
you
on
him
Demetrius
dote
on
you
Exit
HELENA
How
happy
some
o
er
other
some
can
be
Through
Athens
I
am
thought
as
fair
as
she
But
what
of
that
Demetrius
thinks
not
so
He
will
not
know
what
all
but
he
do
know
And
as
he
errs
doting
on
Hermia
s
eyes
So
I
admiring
of
his
qualities
Things
base
and
vile
holding
no
quantity
Love
can
transpose
to
form
and
dignity
Love
looks
not
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
mind
And
therefore
is
wing
d
Cupid
painted
blind
Nor
hath
Love
s
mind
of
any
judgment
taste
Wings
and
no
eyes
figure
unheedy
haste
And
therefore
is
Love
said
to
be
a
child
Because
in
choice
he
is
so
oft
beguil
d
As
waggish
boys
in
game
themselves
forswear
So
the
boy
Love
is
perjur
d
everywhere
For
ere
Demetrius
look
d
on
Hermia
s
eyne
He
hail
d
down
oaths
that
he
was
only
mine
And
when
this
hail
some
heat
from
Hermia
felt
So
he
dissolv
d
and
show
rs
of
oaths
did
melt
I
will
go
tell
him
of
fair
Hermia
s
flight
Then
to
the
wood
will
he
to
morrow
night
Pursue
her
and
for
this
intelligence
If
I
have
thanks
it
is
a
dear
expense
But
herein
mean
I
to
enrich
my
pain
To
have
his
sight
thither
and
back
again
