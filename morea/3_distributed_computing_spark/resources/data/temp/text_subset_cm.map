God
put
it
in
thy
mind
to
take
it
hence
That
thou
mightst
win
the
more
thy
father
s
love
Pleading
so
wisely
in
excuse
of
it
Come
hither
Harry
sit
thou
by
my
bed
And
hear
I
think
the
very
latest
counsel
That
ever
I
shall
breathe
God
knows
my
son
By
what
by
paths
and
indirect
crook
d
ways
I
met
this
crown
and
I
myself
know
well
How
troublesome
it
sat
upon
my
head
To
thee
it
shall
descend
with
better
quiet
Better
opinion
better
confirmation
For
all
the
soil
of
the
achievement
goes
With
me
into
the
earth
It
seem
d
in
me
But
as
an
honour
snatch
d
with
boist
rous
hand
And
I
had
many
living
to
upbraid
My
gain
of
it
by
their
assistances
Which
daily
grew
to
quarrel
and
to
bloodshed
Wounding
supposed
peace
All
these
bold
fears
Thou
seest
with
peril
I
have
answered
For
all
my
reign
hath
been
but
as
a
scene
Acting
that
argument
And
now
my
death
Changes
the
mood
for
what
in
me
was
purchas
d
Falls
upon
thee
in
a
more
fairer
sort
So
thou
the
garland
wear
st
successively
Yet
though
thou
stand
st
more
sure
than
I
could
do
Thou
art
not
firm
enough
since
griefs
are
green
And
all
my
friends
which
thou
must
make
thy
friends
Have
but
their
stings
and
teeth
newly
ta
en
out
By
whose
fell
working
I
was
first
advanc
d
And
by
whose
power
I
well
might
lodge
a
fear
To
be
again
displac
d
which
to
avoid
I
cut
them
off
and
had
a
purpose
now
To
lead
out
many
to
the
Holy
Land
Lest
rest
and
lying
still
might
make
them
look
Too
near
unto
my
state
Therefore
my
Harry
Be
it
thy
course
to
busy
giddy
minds
With
foreign
quarrels
that
action
hence
borne
out
May
waste
the
memory
of
the
former
days
More
would
I
but
my
lungs
are
wasted
so
That
strength
of
speech
is
utterly
denied
me
How
I
came
by
the
crown
O
God
forgive
And
grant
it
may
with
thee
in
true
peace
live
PRINCE
My
gracious
liege
You
won
it
wore
it
kept
it
gave
it

Then
plain

right
must
my
possession

Which
I
with
more
than
with
a
common
pain
Gainst
all
the
world
will
rightfully
maintain

If
I
were
sawed
into
quantities
I
should
make
four
dozen
of
such
bearded
hermits
staves
as
Master
Shallow
It
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
semblable
coherence
of
his
men
s
spirits
and
his
They
by
observing
of
him
do
bear
themselves
like
foolish
justices
he
by
conversing
with
them
is
turned
into
a
justice
like
serving
man
Their
spirits
are
so
married
in
conjunction
with
the
participation
of
society
that
they
flock
together
in
consent
like
so
many
wild
geese
If
I
had
a
suit
to
Master
Shallow
I
would
humour
his
men
with
the
imputation
of
being
near
their
master
if
to
his
men
I
would
curry
with
Master
Shallow
that
no
man
could
better
command
his
servants
It
is
certain
that
either
wise
bearing
or
ignorant
carriage
is
caught
as
men
take
diseases
one
of
another
therefore
let
men
take
heed
of
their
company
I
will
devise
matter
enough
out
of
this
Shallow
to
keep
Prince
Harry
in
continual
laughter
the
wearing
out
of
six
fashions
which
is
four
terms
or
two
actions
and
a
shall
laugh
without
intervallums
O
it
is
much
that
a
lie
with
a
slight
oath
and
a
jest
with
a
sad
brow
will
do
with
a
fellow
that
never
had
the
ache
in
his
shoulders
O
you
shall
see
him
laugh
till
his
face
be

a
wet

laid

Sorrow
so
royally

That
I
will
deeply
put
the
fashion
on
And
wear
it
in

Why

be
sad
But
entertain
no
more

For

heir
of
England

easy
May
this

Lethe

forgotten
CHIEF
JUSTICE
I
then
did
use
the
person
of
your
father
The
image
of
his
power
lay
then
in
me
And
in
th
administration
of
his
law
Whiles
I
was
busy
for
the
commonwealth
Your
Highness
pleased
to
forget
my
place
The
majesty
and
power
of
law
and
justice
The
image
of
the
King
whom
I
presented
And
struck
me
in
my
very
seat
of
judgment
Whereon
as
an
offender
to
your
father
I
gave
bold
way
to
my
authority
And
did
commit
you
If
the
deed
were
ill
Be
you
contented
wearing
now
the
garland
To
have
a
son
set
your
decrees
at
nought
To
pluck
down
justice
from
your
awful
bench
To
trip
the
course
of
law
and
blunt
the
sword
That
guards
the
peace
and
safety
of
your
person
Nay
more
to
spurn
at
your
most
royal
image
And
mock
your
workings
in
a
second
body
Question
your
royal
thoughts
make
the
case
yours
Be
now
the
father
and
propose
a
son
Hear
your
own
dignity
so
much
profan
d
See
your
most
dreadful
laws
so
loosely
slighted
Behold
yourself
so
by
a
son
disdain
d
And
then
imagine
me
taking
your
part
And
in
your
power
soft
silencing
your
son
After
this
cold
considerance
sentence
me
And
as
you
are
a
king
speak
in
your
state
What
I
have
done
that
misbecame
my
place
My
person
or
my
liege
s
sovereignty
KING
You
are
right
Justice
and
you
weigh
this
well
Therefore
still
bear
the
balance
and
the
sword
And
I
do
wish
your
honours
may
increase
Till
you
do
live
to
see
a
son
of
mine
Offend
you
and
obey
you
as
I
did
So
shall
I
live
to
speak
my
father
s
words
Happy
am
I
that
have
a
man
so
bold
That
dares
do
justice
on
my
proper
son
And
not
less
happy
having
such
a
son
That
would
deliver
up
his
greatness
so
Into
the
hands
of
justice
You
did
commit
me
For
which
I
do
commit
into
your
hand
Th
unstained
sword
that
you
have
us
d
to
bear
With
this
remembrance
that
you
use
the
same
With
the
like
bold
just
and
impartial
spirit
As
you
have
done
gainst
me
There
is
my
hand
You
shall
be
as
a
father
to
my
youth
My
voice
shall
sound
as
you
do
prompt
mine
ear
And
I
will
stoop
and
humble
my
intents
To
your
well
practis
d
wise
directions
And
Princes
all
believe
me
I
beseech
you
My
father
is
gone
wild
into
his
grave
For
in
his
tomb
lie
my
affections
And
with
his
spirits
sadly
I
survive
To
mock
the
expectation
of
the
world
To
frustrate
prophecies
and
to
raze
out
Rotten
opinion
who
hath
writ
me
down
After
my
seeming
The
tide
of
blood
in

Hath
proudly
flow
d
in
vanity
till
now
Now
doth
it
turn
and
ebb
back
to
the
sea
Where
it
shall
mingle
with
the
state
of
floods
And
flow
henceforth
in
formal
majesty
Now
call
we

high
court
of

And
let
us
choose
such
limbs
of
noble
counsel
That

In

That
