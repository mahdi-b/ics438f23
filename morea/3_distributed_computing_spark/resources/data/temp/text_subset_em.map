Pray

Methinks
I
should
know
you
and
know
this
man
Yet
I
am
doubtful

I
am
mainly
ignorant
What
place
this
is

the
skill
I
have
Remembers
not
these
garments

I
know
not
Where
I
did
lodge
last
night
Do
not
laugh
at
me
For

I
am

To
be
my
child
Cordelia

you
do
not

me
for
your

remember
done
me
wrong
You

Where

known
the
miseries
of
your

Edg
By
nursing

my
lord
List
a
brief
tale
And
when
tis
told
O
that
my
heart
would
burst
The
bloody
proclamation
to
escape
That
follow

so
near
O
our
lives
sweetness
That
with
the
pain
of
death
would
hourly
die
Rather

taught

to
shift
Into
a
madman

t
assume
a
semblance
That
very
dogs

Met

Led

d
for

sav
d
him
from
despair
Never
O

d
myself
unto

Until
some
half
hour

I
was

d
Not
sure
though
hoping
of
this
good
success
I
ask
d
his
blessing
and
from
first
to
last
Told
him
my
pilgrimage
But
his
flaw
d
heart
Alack
too
weak
the
conflict
to
support
Twixt
two
extremes
of
passion
joy
and
grief
Burst
smilingly
Edm
This
speech
of
yours
hath
mov
d
me
And
shall
perchance
do
good
but
speak
you
on
You
look
as
you
had
something
more
to
say
Alb
If
there
be
more
more
woful
hold
it
in
For
I
am
almost
ready

Hearing
of
this
Edg
This
would
have
seem
d
a
period
To
such
as
love
not
sorrow
but
another
To
amplify
too
much
would
make
much
more
And
top
extremity
Whilst
I
was
big
in
clamour
came
there
a
man
Who
having
seen
me
in
my
worst
estate
Shunn
d
my
abhorr
d
society
but
then
finding
Who
twas
that
so
endur

with
his
strong
arms
He
fastened
on
my
neck
and
bellowed
out
As

threw
him
on
my
father
Told
the
most
piteous
tale
of
Lear

That
ever
ear

which
in
recounting
His
grief
grew
puissant
and
the
strings
of

Began
to
crack
Twice

the
trumpets
sounded
And
there
I
left
