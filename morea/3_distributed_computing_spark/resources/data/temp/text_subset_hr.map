From

Noble

When
thy
first
griefs
were
but
a
mere
conceit
Ere
thou
hadst
power
or

had
cause
of

We
sent
to

to
give
thy
rages
balm
To
wipe
out

Above

So

Transformed
Timon

We
were

FIRST

These

Were

You

That

For

Nor

Shame

Hath

Into

By

If

SENATOR
All

For
those
that

not
square
to

On
those
that
are

crimes
like

Are
not

Then
dear
countryman
Bring

but
leave
without
thy

Spare
thy
Athenian
cradle
and
those

Which
in
the
bluster
of

With

Make

And
if
thy

O

Sufficeth
not
that
we

To

Captive
