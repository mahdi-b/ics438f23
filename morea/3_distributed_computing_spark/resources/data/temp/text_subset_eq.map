DUMAIN
Once
more
I
ll
read
the
ode
that
I
have
writ
BEROWNE
Once
more
I
ll
mark
how
love
can
vary
wit
DUMAIN
Reads
On
a
day
alack
the
day
Love
whose
month
is
ever
May
Spied
a
blossom
passing
fair
Playing
in
the
wanton
air
Through
the
velvet
leaves
the
wind
All
unseen
can
passage
find
That
the
lover
sick
to
death
Wish
d
himself
the
heaven
s
breath
Air
quoth
he
thy
cheeks
may
blow
Air
would
I
might
triumph
so
But
alack
my
hand
is
sworn
Ne
er
to
pluck
thee
from
thy
thorn
Vow
alack
for
youth
unmeet
Youth
so
apt
to
pluck
a
sweet
Do
not
call
it
sin
in
me
That
I
am
forsworn
for
thee
Thou
for
whom
Jove
would
swear
Juno
but
an
Ethiope
were
And
deny
himself
for
Jove
Turning
mortal
for
thy
love
This
will
I
send
and
something
else
more
plain
That
shall
express
my
true
love
s
fasting
pain
O
would
the
King
Berowne
and
Longaville
Were
lovers
too
Ill
to
example
ill
Would
from
my
forehead
wipe
a
perjur
d
note
For
none
offend
where
all
alike
do
dote
LONGAVILLE
Advancing
Dumain
thy
love
is
far
from
charity
That
in
love
s
grief
desir
st
society
You
may
look
pale
but
I
should
blush
I
know
To
be
o
erheard
and
taken
napping
so
KING
Advancing
Come
sir
you
blush
as
his
your
case
is
such
You
chide
at
him
offending
twice
as
much
You
do
not
love
Maria
Longaville
Did
never
sonnet
for
her
sake
compile
Nor
never
lay
his
wreathed
arms
athwart
His
loving
bosom
to
keep
down
his
heart
I
have
been
closely
shrouded
in
this
bush
And
mark
d
you
both
and
for
you
both
did
blush
I
heard
your
guilty
rhymes
observ
d
your
fashion
Saw
sighs
reek
from
you
noted
well
your
passion
Ay
me
says
one
O
Jove
the
other
cries
One
her
hairs
were
gold
crystal
the
other
s
eyes
To
LONGAVILLE
You
would
for
paradise
break
faith
and
troth
To
Dumain
And
Jove
for
your
love
would
infringe
an
oath
What
will
Berowne
say
when
that
he
shall
hear
Faith
infringed
which
such
zeal
did
swear
How
will
he
scorn
how
will
he
spend
his
wit
How
will
he
triumph
leap
and
laugh
at
it
For
all
the
wealth
that
ever
I
did
see
I
would
not
have
him
know
so
much
by
me
BEROWNE
Descending
Now
step
I
forth
to
whip
hypocrisy
Ah
good
my
liege
I
pray
thee
pardon
me
Good
heart
what
grace
hast
thou
thus
to
reprove
These
worms
for
loving
that
art
most
in
love
Your
eyes
do
make
no
coaches
in
your
tears
There
is
no
certain
princess
that
appears
You
ll
not
be
perjur
d
tis
a
hateful
thing
Tush
none
but
minstrels
like
of
sonneting
But
are
you
not
ashamed
Nay
are
you
not
All
three
of
you
to
be
thus
much
o
ershot
You
found
his
mote
the
King
your
mote
did
see
But
I
a
beam
do
find
in
each
of
three
O
what
a
scene
of
fool
ry
have
I
seen
Of
sighs
of
groans
of
sorrow
and
of
teen
O
me
with
what
strict
patience
have
I
sat
To
see
a
king
transformed
to
a
gnat
To
see
great
Hercules
whipping
a
gig
And
profound
Solomon
to
tune
a
jig
And
Nestor
play
at
push
pin
with
the
boys
And
critic
Timon
laugh
at
idle
toys
Where
lies
thy
grief
O
tell
me
good
Dumain
And
gentle
Longaville
where
lies
thy
pain
And
where
my
liege
s
All
about
the
breast
A
caudle
ho
KING
Too
bitter
is
thy
jest
Are
we
betrayed
thus
to
thy
over
view
BEROWNE
Not
you
by
me
but
I
betrayed
to
you
I
that
am
honest
I
that
hold
it
sin
To
break
the
vow
I
am
engaged
in
I
am
betrayed
by
keeping
company
With
men
like
you
men
of
inconstancy
When
shall
you
see
me
write
a
thing
in
rhyme
Or
groan
for
Joan
or
spend
a
minute
s
time
In
pruning
me
When
shall
you
hear
that
I
Will
praise
a
hand
a
foot
a
face
an
eye
A
gait
a
state
a
brow
a
breast
a
waist
A
leg
a

KING
Soft
whither
away
so
fast
A
true
man
or
a
thief
that
gallops
so
BEROWNE
I
post
from
love
good
lover
let
me
go
Enter
JAQUENETTA
and
COSTARD
JAQUENETTA
God
bless
the
King
KING
What
present
hast

COSTARD
Some
certain
treason
KING
What

here
COSTARD
Nay
it
makes
nothing

KING
If

The

away
together
JAQUENETTA
I

your

let
this

Our

KING
How
now
What

in
you
Why
dost
thou
tear
it
BEROWNE
A
toy
my
liege
a
toy
Your
Grace
needs
not
fear
it
LONGAVILLE
It
did
move
him
to
passion
and
therefore
let
s
hear
it
DUMAIN
It
is
Berowne
s
writing
and
here
is
his
name
Gathering
up
the
pieces
BEROWNE
To
COSTARD
Ah
you
whoreson
loggerhead
you
were
born
to
do
me
shame
Guilty
my
lord
guilty
I
confess
I
confess
KING
What
BEROWNE
That
you
three
fools
lack
d
me
fool
to
make
up
the
mess
He
he
and
you
and
you
my
liege
and
I
Are
pick
purses
in
love
and
we
deserve
to
die
O
dismiss
this
audience
and
I
shall
tell
you
more
DUMAIN
Now
the
number
is
even
BEROWNE
True
true
we
are
four
Will
these
turtles
be
gone
KING
Hence
sirs
away
COSTARD
Walk
aside
the
true
folk
and
let
the
traitors
stay
Exeunt
COSTARD
and
JAQUENETTA
BEROWNE
Sweet
lords
sweet
lovers
O
let
us
embrace
As
true
we
are
as
flesh
and
blood
can
be
The
sea
will
ebb
and
flow
heaven
show
his
face
Young
blood
doth
not
obey
an
old
decree
We
cannot
cross
the
cause
why
we
were
born
Therefore
of
all
hands
must
we
be
forsworn
KING
What
did
these
rent
lines
show
some
love
of
thine
BEROWNE
Did
they
quoth
you
Who
sees
the
heavenly
Rosaline
That
like
a
rude
and
savage
man
of
Inde
At
the
first
op
ning
of
the
gorgeous
east
Bows
not
his
vassal
head
and
strucken
blind
Kisses
the
base
ground
with
obedient
breast
What
peremptory
eagle
sighted
eye
Dares
look
upon
the
heaven
of
her
brow
That
is
not
blinded
by
her
majesty
KING
What
zeal
what
fury
hath
inspir
d
thee
now
My
love
her
mistress
is
a
gracious
moon
She
an
attending
star
scarce
seen
a
light
BEROWNE
My
eyes
are
then
no
eyes
nor
I
Berowne
O
but
for
my
love
day
would
turn
to
night
Of
all
complexions
the
cull
d
sovereignty
Do
meet
as
at
a
fair
in
her
fair
cheek
Where
several
worthies
make
one
dignity
Where
nothing
wants
that
want
itself
doth
seek
Lend
me
the
flourish
of
all
gentle
tongues
Fie
painted
rhetoric
O
she
needs
it
not
To
things
of
sale
a
seller
s
praise
belongs
She
passes
praise
then
praise
too
short
doth
blot
A
wither
d
hermit
five
score
winters
worn
Might
shake
off
fifty
looking
in
her
eye
Beauty
doth
varnish
age
as
if
new
born
And
gives
the
crutch
the
cradle
s
infancy
O
tis
the
sun
that
maketh
all
things
shine
KING
By
heaven
thy
love
is
black
as
ebony
BEROWNE
Is
ebony
like
her
O
wood
divine
A
wife
of
such
wood
were
felicity
O
who
can
give
an
oath
Where
is
a
book
That
I
may
swear
beauty
doth
beauty
lack
If
that
she
learn
not
of
her
eye
to
look
No
face
is
fair
that
is
not
full
so
black
KING
O
paradox
Black
is
the
badge
of
hell
The
hue
of
dungeons
and
the
school
of
night
And
beauty
s
crest
becomes
the
heavens
well
BEROWNE
Devils
soonest
tempt
resembling
spirits
of
light
O
if
in
black
my
lady
s
brows
be
deckt
It
mourns
that
painting
and
usurping
hair
Should
ravish
doters
with
a
false
aspect
And
therefore
is
she
born
to
make
black
fair
Her
favour
turns
the
fashion
of
the
days
For
native
blood
is
counted
painting
now
And
therefore
red
that
would
avoid
dispraise
Paints
itself
black
to
imitate
her
brow
DUMAIN
To
look
like
her
are
chimney
sweepers
black
LONGAVILLE
And
since
her
time
are
colliers
counted
bright
KING
And
Ethiopes
of
their
sweet
complexion
crack
DUMAIN
Dark
needs
no
candles
now
for
dark
is
light
BEROWNE
Your
mistresses
dare
never
come
in
rain
For
fear
their
colours
should
be
wash
d
away
KING
Twere
good
yours
did
for
sir
to
tell
you
plain
I
ll
find
a
fairer
face
not
wash
d
to
day
BEROWNE
I
ll
prove
her
fair
or
talk
till
doomsday
here
KING
No
devil
will
fright
thee
then
so
much
as
she
DUMAIN
I
never
knew
man
hold
vile
stuff
so
dear
LONGAVILLE
Look
here
s
thy
love
my
foot
and
her
face
see
Showing
his
shoe
BEROWNE
O
if
the
streets
were
paved
with
thine
eyes
Her
feet
were
much
too
dainty
for
such
tread
DUMAIN
O
vile
Then
as
she
goes
what
upward
lies
The
street
should
see
as
she
walk
d
overhead
KING
But
what
of
this
Are
we
not
all
in
love
BEROWNE
Nothing
so
sure
and
thereby
all
forsworn
KING
Then
leave
this
chat
and
good
Berowne
now
prove
Our
loving
lawful
and
our
faith
not
torn
DUMAIN
Ay
marry
there
some
flattery
for
this
evil
LONGAVILLE
O
some
authority
how
to
proceed
Some
tricks
some
quillets
how
to
cheat
the
devil
DUMAIN
Some
salve
for
perjury
BEROWNE
Tis
more
than
need
Have
at
you
then
affection
s
men
at
arms
Consider
what
you
first
did
swear
unto
To
fast
to
study
and
to
see
no
woman
Flat
treason
gainst
the
kingly
state
of
youth
Say
can
you
fast
Your
stomachs
are
too
young
And
abstinence
engenders
maladies
And
where
that
you
you
have
vow
d
to
study
lords
In
that
each
of
you
have
forsworn
his
book
Can
you
still
dream
and
pore
and
thereon
look
For
when
would
you
my
lord
or
you
or
you
Have
found
the
ground
of
study
s
excellence
Without
the
beauty
of
a
woman
s
face
From
women
s
eyes
this
doctrine
I
derive
They
are
the
ground
the
books
the
academes
From
whence
doth
spring
the
true
Promethean
fire
Why
universal
plodding
poisons
up
The
nimble
spirits
in
the
arteries
As
motion
and
long
during
action
tires
The
sinewy
vigour
of
the
traveller
Now
for
not
looking
on
a
woman
s
face
You
have
in
that
forsworn
the
use
of
eyes
And
study
too
the
causer
of
your
vow
For
where
is
author
in
the
world
Teaches
such
beauty
as
a
woman
s
eye
Learning
is
but
an
adjunct
to
ourself
And
where
we
are
our
learning
likewise
is
Then
when
ourselves
we
see
in
ladies
eyes
With
ourselves
Do
we
not
likewise
see
our
learning
there
O
we
have
made
a
vow
to
study
lords
And
in
that
vow
we
have
forsworn
our
books
For
when
would
you
my
liege
or
you
or
you
In
leaden
contemplation
have
found
out
Such
fiery
numbers
as
the
prompting
eyes
Of
beauty
s
tutors
have
enrich
d
you
with
Other
slow
arts
entirely
keep
the
brain
And
therefore
finding
barren
practisers
Scarce
show
a
harvest
of
their
heavy
toil
But
love
first
learned
in
a
lady
s
eyes
Lives
not
alone
immured
in
the
brain
But
with
the
motion
of
all
elements
Courses
as
swift
as
thought
in
every
power
And
gives
to
every
power
a
double
power
Above
their
functions
and
their
offices
It
adds
a
precious
seeing
to
the
eye
A
lover
s
eyes
will
gaze
an
eagle
blind
A
lover
s
ear
will
hear
the
lowest
sound
When
the
suspicious
head
of
theft
is
stopp
d
Love
s
feeling
is
more
soft
and
sensible
Than
are
the
tender
horns
of
cockled
snails
Love
s
tongue
proves
dainty
Bacchus
gross
in
taste
For
valour
is
not
Love
a
Hercules
Still
climbing
trees
in
the
Hesperides
Subtle
as
Sphinx
as
sweet
and
musical
As
bright
Apollo
s
lute
strung
with
his
hair
And
when
Love
speaks
the
voice
of
all
the
gods
Make
heaven
drowsy
with
the
harmony
Never
durst
poet
touch
a
pen
to
write
Until
his
ink
were
temp
red
with
Love
s
sighs
O
then
his
lines
would
ravish
savage
ears
And
plant
in
tyrants
mild
humility
From
women
s
eyes
this
doctrine
I
derive
They
sparkle
still
the
right
Promethean
fire
They
are
the
books
the
arts
the
academes
That
show
contain
and
nourish
all
the
world
Else
none
at
all
in
aught
proves
excellent
Then
fools
you
were
these
women
to
forswear
Or
keeping
what
is
sworn
you
will
prove
fools
For
wisdom
s
sake
a
word
that
all
men
love
Or
for
Love
s
sake
a
word
that
loves
all
men
Or
for
men
s
sake
the
authors
of
these
women
Or
women
s
sake
by
whom
we
men
are
men
Let
us
once
lose
our
oaths
to
find
ourselves
Or
else
we
lose
ourselves
to
keep
our
oaths
It
is
religion
to
be
thus
forsworn
For
charity
itself
fulfils
the
law
And
who
can
sever
love
from
charity
KING
Saint
Cupid
then
and
soldiers
to
the
field
BEROWNE
Advance
your
standards
and
upon

Pell

LONGAVILLE
Now
to
plain
dealing

these
glozes

Shall
we
resolve
to
woo
these
girls
of
France
KING
And
win
them
too
therefore
let
us
devise
Some
entertainment
for
them
in
their
tents
BEROWNE
First
from
the
park
let
us
conduct
them
thither
Then
homeward
every
man
attach
the
hand
Of
his
fair
mistress
In
the
afternoon
We
will
with
some
strange
pastime
solace
them
Such
as
the
shortness
of
the
time
can
shape
For
revels
dances
masks
and
merry
hours
Forerun
fair
Love
strewing
her
way
with
flowers
KING
Away
away
No
time
shall

That

BEROWNE
Allons

Sow

And

DULL
HOLOFERNES
Satis

NATHANIEL
I
praise
God
for
you
sir
Your
reasons
at
dinner
have
been
sharp
and
sententious
pleasant
without
scurrility
witty
without
affection
audacious
without
impudency
learned
without
opinion
and
strange
without
heresy
I
did
converse
this
quondam
day
with
a
companion
of
the
King

who
is
intituled
nominated
or
called
Don
Adriano
de
Armado
HOLOFERNES
Novi
hominem
tanquam

His
humour
is
lofty
his
discourse
peremptory
his
tongue
filed
his
eye
ambitious
his
gait
majestical
and
his
general
behaviour
vain
ridiculous
and
thrasonical
He
