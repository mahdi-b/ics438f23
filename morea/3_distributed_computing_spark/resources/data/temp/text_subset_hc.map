A
course

his
virtuous
deeds
And
therefore
Tranio
for
the
time

study
Virtue

that
part
of
philosophy
Will
I

that

of
happiness
By

Tell

I
have
Pisa
left
And
am
to
Padua
come

he
that
leaves
A
shallow
plash
to
plunge
him
in
the
deep
And
with
satiety
seeks
to

his
thirst

To

Only

admire
This

Before

If

love
Katherina

gentler
milder
mould
KATHERINA
I
faith
sir
you
shall
never
need
to
fear
Iwis
it
is
not
halfway
to
her
heart
But
if
it
were
doubt
not
her
care
should
be
To
comb
your
noddle
with
a
three
legg
d
stool
And
paint
your
face
and
use
you
like
a
fool
HORTENSIO
From

Sorry

GREMIO
Why
will
you
mew
her
up
Signior
Baptista
for
this
fiend
of

And
make
her
bear
the
penance
of
her
tongue
BAPTISTA
Gentlemen
content

d
Go
in
Bianca
Exit
BIANCA
And
for
I
know
she
taketh
most
delight
In
music

and
poetry
Schoolmasters
will
I
keep
within
my
house
Fit
to
instruct
her
youth
If
you
Hortensio
Or
Signior
Gremio
you
know
any
such
Prefer
them

for
to
cunning
men
I
will
be
very
kind
and
liberal
To
mine
own
children
in
good
bringing
up
And
so
farewell
Katherina
you
may
stay
For
I
have
more
to
commune
with
Bianca
Exit
KATHERINA
Why
and
I
trust
I
may
go
too
may
I
not
What
shall
I
be
appointed

though
belike
I
knew
not
what
to
take

what
to
leave
Ha
Exit
GREMIO
You
may
go
to
the
devil
s
dam
your
gifts
are
so
good
here
s
none
will
hold
you
There
Love
is
not
so
great
Hortensio
but
we
may
blow
our
nails
together
and
fast
it
fairly
out
our
cake
s
dough
on
both
sides
Farewell
yet
for
the
love
I
bear
my
sweet
Bianca
if
I
can
by
any
means
light
on
a
fit
man
to
teach
her
that
wherein
she
delights
I
will
wish
him
to
her
father
HORTENSIO
SO
Will
I
Signior
Gremio
but
a
word
I
pray
Though
the
nature
of
our
quarrel
yet
never
brook
d
parle
know
now
upon
advice
it
toucheth
us
both
that
we
may
yet
again
have
access
to
our
fair
mistress
and
be
happy
rivals
in
Bianca
s
love
to
labour
and
effect
one
thing
specially
GREMIO
What
s
that
I
pray
HORTENSIO
Marry
sir
to
get
a
husband
for
her
sister
GREMIO
A
husband
a
devil
HORTENSIO
I
say
a
husband
GREMIO
I
say
a
devil
Think
st
thou
Hortensio
though
her
father
be
very
rich
any
man
is
so
very
a
fool
to
be
married
to
hell
HORTENSIO
Tush
Gremio
Though
it
pass
your
patience
and
mine
to
endure
her
loud
alarums
why
man
there
be
good
fellows
in
the
world
an
a
man
could
light
on
them
would
take
her
with
all
faults
and
money
enough
GREMIO
I
cannot
tell
but
I
had
as
lief
take
her
dowry
with
this
condition
to
be
whipp
d
at
the
high
cross
every
morning
HORTENSIO
Faith
as
you
say
there
s
small
choice
in
rotten
apples
But
come
since
this
bar
in
law
makes
us
friends
it
shall
be
so
far
forth
friendly
maintain
d
till
by
helping
Baptista
s
eldest
daughter
to
a
husband
we
set
his
youngest
free
for
a
husband
and
then
have
to
t
afresh
Sweet
Bianca
Happy
man
be
his
dole
He
that
runs
fastest
gets
the
ring
How
say
you
Signior
Gremio
GREMIO
I
am
agreed
and
would
I
had
given
him
the
best
horse
in
Padua
to
begin
his
wooing
that
would
thoroughly
woo
her
wed
her
and
bed
her
and
rid
the
house
of
her
Come
on
Exeunt
GREMIO
and
HORTENSIO
TRANIO
I
pray
sir
tell
me
is
it
possible
That
love
should
of
a
sudden
take
such
hold
LUCENTIO
O
Tranio
till
I
found
it
to
be
true
I
never
thought
it
possible
or
likely
But
see
while
idly
I
stood
looking
on
I
found
the
effect
of
love
in
idleness
And
now
in
plainness
do
confess
to
thee
That
art
to
me
as
secret
and
as
dear
As
Anna
to
the
Queen
of
Carthage
was
Tranio
I
burn
I
pine
I
perish
Tranio
If
I
achieve
not
this
young
modest
girl
Counsel
me
Tranio
for
I
know
thou
canst
Assist
me
Tranio
for
I
know
thou
wilt
TRANIO
Master
it
is
no
time
to
chide
you
now
Affection
is
not
rated
from
the
heart
If

you
nought
remains

TRANIO
Master
you
look
d
so
longly
on
the
maid
Perhaps
you
mark
d
not
what
s
the
pith
of
all
LUCENTIO
O
yes
I
saw
sweet
beauty
in
her
face
Such
as
the
daughter
of
Agenor
had
That
made
great
Jove
to
humble
him
to
her
hand
When
with
his
knees
he
kiss
d
the
Cretan
strand
TRANIO
Saw
you
no
more
Mark
d
you
not
how
her
sister
Began
to
scold
and
raise
up
such
a
storm
That
mortal
ears
might
hardly
endure
the
din
LUCENTIO
Tranio
I
saw
her
coral
lips
to
move
And
with
her
breath
she
did
perfume
the
air
Sacred
and
sweet
was
all
I
saw
in
her
TRANIO
Nay
then
tis
time
to
stir
him
from
his
trance
I
pray
awake
sir
If
you
love
the
maid
Bend
thoughts
and
wits
to
achieve
her
Thus
it
stands
Her
elder
sister
is
so
curst
and
shrewd
That
till
the
father
rid
his
hands
of
her
Master
your
love
must
live
a
maid
at
home
And
therefore
has
he
closely
mew
d
her
up
Because
she
will
not
be
annoy
d
with
suitors
LUCENTIO
Ah
Tranio
what
a
cruel
father
s
he
But
art
thou
not
advis
d
he
took
some
care
To
get
her
cunning
schoolmasters
to
instruct
her
TRANIO
Ay

Both

LUCENTIO

TRANIO
You
will
be
schoolmaster
And
undertake
the
teaching
of
the
maid
That

your
device
LUCENTIO
It
is
May

TRANIO
Not

Keep

friend
Petruchio
How
do

at
Verona
PETRUCHIO
Signior
Hortensio

to
part
the
fray
Con

say
HORTENSIO
Alla
nostra
casa
ben
venuto
Molto
honorato
signor
mio
Petruchio
Rise
Grumio
rise
we
will
compound
this
quarrel
GRUMIO
Nay
tis
no
matter
sir
what
he
leges
in
Latin
If
this
be
not
a
lawful
cause
for
me
to
leave
his
service
look
you
sir
he
bid
me
knock
him
and
rap
him
soundly
sir
Well
was
it
fit
for
a
servant
to
use
his
master
so
being
perhaps
for
aught
I
see
two
and
thirty
a
pip
out
Whom
would
to
God
I
had
well
knock
d
at
first
Then
had
not
Grumio
come
by
the
worst
PETRUCHIO
A
senseless
villain
Good
Hortensio
I
bade
the
rascal
knock
upon
your
gate
And
could
not
get
him
for
my
heart
to
do
it
GRUMIO
Knock
at
the
gate
O
heavens
Spake
you
not
these
words
plain
Sirrah
knock
me
here
rap
me
here
knock
me
well
and
knock
me
soundly
And
come
you
now
with
knocking
at
the
gate
PETRUCHIO
Sirrah
be
gone
or
talk
not
I
advise
you
HORTENSIO
Petruchio
patience
I
am
Grumio
s
pledge
Why
this
s
a
heavy
chance
twixt
him
and
you
Your
ancient
trusty
pleasant
servant
Grumio
And
tell
me
now
sweet
friend
what
happy
gale
Blows
you
to
Padua
here
from
old
Verona
PETRUCHIO
Such
wind
as
scatters
young
men
through
the
world
To
seek
their
fortunes
farther
than
at
home
Where
small
experience
grows
But
in
a
few
Signior
Hortensio
thus
it
stands
with
me
Antonio
my
father
is
deceas
d
And
I
have
thrust
myself
into
this
maze
Haply
to
wive
and
thrive
as
best
I
may
Crowns
in
my
purse
I
have
and
goods
at
home
And
so
am
come
abroad
to
see
the
world
HORTENSIO
Petruchio
shall
I
then
come
roundly
to
thee
And
wish
thee
to
a
shrewd
ill
favour
d
wife
Thou
dst
thank
me
but
a
little
for
my
counsel
And
yet
I
ll
promise
thee
she
shall
be
rich
And
very
rich
but
th
art
too
much
my
friend
And
I
ll
not
wish
thee
to
her
PETRUCHIO
Signior
Hortensio
twixt
such
friends
as
we
Few
words
suffice
and
therefore
if
thou
know
One
rich
enough
to
be
Petruchio
s
wife
As
wealth
is
burden
of
my
wooing
dance
Be
she
as
foul
as
was
Florentius
love
As
old
as
Sibyl
and
as
curst
and
shrewd
As
Socrates
Xanthippe
or
a
worse
She
moves
me
not
or
not
removes
at
least
Affection
s
edge
in
me
were
she
as
rough
As
are
the
swelling
Adriatic
seas
I
come
to
wive
it
wealthily
in
Padua
If
wealthily
then
happily
in
Padua
GRUMIO
Nay
look
you
sir
he
tells
you
flatly
what
his
mind
is
Why
give
him
gold
enough
and
marry
him
to
a
puppet
or
an
aglet
baby
or
an
old
trot
with
ne
er
a
tooth
in
her
head
though
she
has
as
many
diseases
as
two
and
fifty
horses
Why
nothing
comes
amiss
so
money
comes
withal
HORTENSIO
Petruchio
since
we
are
stepp
d
thus
far
in
I
will
continue
that
I
broach
d
in
jest
I
can
Petruchio
help
thee
to
a
wife
With
wealth
enough
and
young
and
beauteous
Brought
up
as
best
becomes
a
gentlewoman
Her
only
fault
and
that
is
faults
enough
Is
that
she
is
intolerable
curst
And
shrewd
and
froward
so
beyond
all
measure
That
were
my
state
far
worser
than
it
is
I
would
not
wed
her
for
a
mine
of
gold
PETRUCHIO
Hortensio
peace
thou
know
st
not
gold
s
effect
Tell
me
her
father
s
name
and
tis
enough
For
I
will
board
her
though
she
chide
as
loud
As
thunder
when
the
clouds
in
autumn
crack
HORTENSIO
Her
father
is
Baptista
Minola
An
affable
and
courteous
gentleman
Her
name
is
Katherina
Minola
Renown
d
in
Padua
for
her
scolding
tongue
PETRUCHIO
I
know
her
father
though
I
know
not
her
And
he
knew
my
deceased
father
well
I
will
not
sleep
Hortensio
till
I
see
her
And
therefore
let
me
be
thus
bold
with
you
To
give
you
over
at
this
first
encounter
Unless
you
will
accompany
me
thither
GRUMIO
I
pray
you
sir
let
him
go
while
the
humour
lasts
O
my
word
and
she
knew
him
as
well
as
I
do
she
would
think
scolding
would
do
little
good
upon
him
She
may
perhaps
call
him
half
a
score
knaves
or
so
Why
that
s
nothing
and
he
begin
once
he
ll
rail
in
his
rope
tricks
I
ll
tell
you
what
sir
an
she
stand
him
but
a
little
he
will
throw
a
figure
in
her
face
and
so
disfigure
her
with
it
that
she
shall
have
no
more
eyes
to
see
withal
than
a
cat
You
know
him
not
sir
HORTENSIO
Tarry
Petruchio
I
must
go
with
thee
For
in
Baptista
s
keep
my
treasure
is
He
hath
the
jewel
of
my
life
in
hold
His
youngest
daughter
beautiful
Bianca
And
her
withholds
from
me
and
other
more
Suitors
to
her
and
rivals
in
my
love
Supposing
it
a
thing
impossible
For
those
defects
I
have
before
rehears
d
That
ever
Katherina
will
be
woo
d
Therefore
this
order
hath
Baptista
ta
en
That
none
shall
have
access
unto
Bianca
Till
Katherine
the
curst
have
got
a
husband
GRUMIO
Katherine
the
curst
A
title
for
a
maid
of
all
titles
the
worst
HORTENSIO
Now
shall
my
friend
Petruchio
do
me
grace
And
offer
me
disguis
d
in
sober
robes
To
old
Baptista
as
a
schoolmaster
Well
seen
in
music
to
instruct
Bianca
That
so
I
may
by
this
device
at
least
Have
leave
and
leisure
to
make
love
to
her
And
unsuspected
court
her
by
herself
Enter
GREMIO
with
LUCENTIO
disguised
as
CAMBIO
GRUMIO
Here
s
no
knavery
See
to
beguile
the
old
folks
how
the
young
folks
lay
their
heads
together
Master
master
look
about
you
Who
goes
there
ha
HORTENSIO
Peace
Grumio
It
is
the
rival
of
my
love
Petruchio
stand
by
awhile
GRUMIO
A
proper
stripling
and
an
amorous
They
stand
aside
GREMIO
O
very
well
I
have
perus
d
the
note
Hark
you
sir
I
ll
have
them
very
fairly
bound
All
books
of
love
see
that
at
any
hand
And
see
you
read
no
other
lectures
to
her
You
understand
me
over
and
beside
Signior
Baptista
s
liberality
I
ll
mend
it
with
a
largess
Take
your
paper
too
And
let
me
have
them
very
well
perfum
d
For
she
is
sweeter
than
perfume
itself
To
whom
they
go
to
What
will
you
read
to
her
LUCENTIO
Whate
er
I
read
to
her
I
ll
plead
for
you
As
for
my
patron
stand
you
so
assur
d
As
firmly
as
yourself
were
still
in
place
Yea
and
perhaps
with
more
successful
words
Than
you
unless
you
were
a
scholar
sir
GREMIO
O
this
learning
what
a
thing
it
is
GRUMIO
O
this
woodcock
what
an
ass
it
is
PETRUCHIO
Peace
sirrah
HORTENSIO
Grumio
mum
Coming
forward
God
save
you
Signior
Gremio
GREMIO
And
you
are
well
met
Signior
Hortensio
Trow
you
whither
I
am
going
To
Baptista
Minola
I
promis
d
to
enquire
carefully
About
a
schoolmaster
for
the
fair
Bianca
And
by
good
fortune
I
have
lighted
well
On
this
young
man
for
learning
and
behaviour
Fit
for
her
turn
well
read
in
poetry
