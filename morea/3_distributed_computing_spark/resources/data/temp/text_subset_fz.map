SCENE
Venice
and
Cyprus
ACT
I
SCENE
I
Venice
A
street
Enter
Roderigo
and
Iago
RODERIGO
Tush
never
tell
me
I
take
it
much
unkindly
That
thou
Iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
As
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
IAGO
Sblood
but
you
will
not
hear
me
If
ever
I
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
Abhor
me
RODERIGO
Thou
told
st
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
IAGO
Despise
me
if
I
do
not
Three
great
ones
of
the
city
In
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
Off
capp
d
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
I
know
my
price
I
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
But
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
Evades
them
with
a
bumbast
circumstance
Horribly
stuff
d
with
epithets
of
war
And
in
conclusion
Nonsuits
my
mediators
for
Certes
says
he
I
have
already
chose
my
officer
And
what
was
he
Forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
One
Michael
Cassio
a
Florentine
A
fellow
almost
damn
d
in
a
fair
wife
That
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
Nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
More
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
Wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
As
masterly
as
he
Mere
prattle
without
practice
Is
all
his
soldiership
But
he
sir
had
the
election
And
I
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
At
Rhodes
at
Cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
Christian
and
heathen
must
be
belee
d
and
calm
d
By
debitor
and
creditor
This
counter
caster
He
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
And
I
God
bless
the
mark
his
Moorship
s
ancient
RODERIGO
By
heaven
I
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
IAGO
Why
there
s
no
remedy
Tis
the
curse
of
service
Preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
And
not
by
old
gradation
where
each
second
Stood
heir
to
the
first
Now
sir
be
judge
yourself
Whether
I
in
any
just
term
am
affined
To
love
the
Moor
RODERIGO
I
would
not
follow
him
then
IAGO
O
sir
content
you
I
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
We
cannot
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
Cannot
be
truly
follow
d
You
shall
mark
Many
a
duteous
and
knee
crooking
knave
That
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
Wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
master
s
ass
For
nought
but
provender
and
when
he
s
old
cashier
d
Whip
me
such
honest
knaves
Others
there
are
Who
trimm
d
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
Keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
And
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
Do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lined
their
coats
Do
themselves
homage
These
fellows
have
some
soul
And
such
a
one
do
I
profess
myself
For
sir
It
is
as
sure
as
you
are
Roderigo
Were
I
the
Moor
I
would
not
be
Iago
In
following
him
I
follow
but
myself
Heaven
is
my
judge
not
I
for
love
and
duty
But
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
For
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
The
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
In
complement
extern
tis
not
long
after
But
I
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
For
daws
to
peck
at
I
am
not
what
I
am
RODERIGO
What
a
full
fortune
does
the
thick
lips
owe
If
he
can
carry
t
thus
IAGO
Call
up
her
father
Rouse
him
make
after
him
poison
his
delight
Proclaim
him
in
the
streets
incense
her
kinsmen
And
though
he
in
a
fertile
climate
dwell
Plague
him
with
flies
Though
that
his
joy
be
joy
Yet
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
on
t
As
it
may
lose
some
color
RODERIGO
Here
is
her
father
s
house
I
ll
call
aloud
IAGO
Do
with
like
timorous
accent
and
dire
yell
As
when
by
night
and
negligence
the
fire
Is
spied
in
populous
cities
RODERIGO
What
ho
Brabantio
Signior
Brabantio
ho
IAGO
Awake
What
ho
Brabantio
Thieves
Thieves
Thieves
Look
to
your
house
your
daughter
and
your
bags
Thieves
Thieves
Brabantio
appears
above
at
a
window
BRABANTIO
What
is
the
reason
of
this
terrible
summons
What
is
the
matter
there
RODERIGO
Signior
is
all
your
family
within
IAGO
Are
your
doors
lock
d
BRABANTIO
Why
Wherefore
ask
you
this
IAGO
Zounds
sir
you
re
robb
d
For
shame
put
on
your
gown
Your
heart
is
burst
you
have
lost
half
your
soul
Even
now
now
very
now
an
old
black
ram
Is
tupping
your
white
ewe
Arise
arise
Awake
the
snorting
citizens
with
the
bell
Or
else
the
devil
will
make
a
grandsire
of
you
Arise
I
say
BRABANTIO
What
have
you
lost
your
wits
RODERIGO
Most
reverend
signior
do
you
know
my
voice
BRABANTIO
Not
I
What
are
you
RODERIGO
My
name
is
Roderigo
BRABANTIO
The
worser
welcome
I
have
charged
thee
not
to
haunt
about
my
doors
In
honest
plainness
thou
hast
heard
me
say
My
daughter
is
not
for
thee
and
now
in
madness
Being
full
of
supper
and
distempering
draughts
Upon
malicious
bravery
dost
thou
come
To
start
my
quiet
RODERIGO
Sir
sir
sir
BRABANTIO
But
thou
must
needs
be
sure
My
spirit
and
my
place
have
in
them
power
To
make
this
bitter
to
thee
RODERIGO
Patience
good
sir
BRABANTIO
What
tell
st
thou
me
of
robbing
This
is
Venice
My
house
is
not
a
grange
RODERIGO
Most
grave
Brabantio
In
simple
and
pure
soul
I
come
to
you
IAGO
Zounds
sir
you
are
one
of
those
that
will
not
serve
God
if
the
devil
bid
you
Because
we
come
to
do
you
service
and
you
think
we
are
ruffians
you
ll
have
your
daughter
covered
with
a
Barbary
horse
you
ll
have
your
nephews
neigh
to
you
you
ll
have
coursers
for
cousins
and
gennets
for
germans
BRABANTIO
What
profane
wretch
art
thou
IAGO
I
am
one
sir
that
comes
to
tell
you
your
daughter
and
the
Moor
are
now
making
the
beast
with
two
backs
BRABANTIO
Thou
are
a
villain
IAGO
You
are
a
senator
BRABANTIO
This
thou
shalt
answer
I
know
thee
Roderigo
RODERIGO
Sir
I
will
answer
anything
But
I
beseech
you
If
t
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
As
partly
I
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
At
this
odd
even
and
dull
watch
o
the
night
Transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
But
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
To
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
Moor
If
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
We
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
But
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
We
have
your
wrong
rebuke
Do
not
believe
That
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
I
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
Your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
I
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
Tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
In
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
Of
here
and
everywhere
Straight
satisfy
yourself
If
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
Let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
For
thus
deluding
you
BRABANTIO
Strike
on
the
tinder
ho
Give
me
a
taper
Call
up
all
my
people
This
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
Belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
Light
I
say
light
Exit
above
IAGO
Farewell
for
I
must
leave
you
It
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
To
be
produced
as
if
I
stay
I
shall
Against
the
Moor
for
I
do
know
the
state
However
this
may
gall
him
with
some
check
Cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
he
s
embark
d
With
such
loud
reason
to
the
Cyprus
wars
Which
even
now
stands
in
act
that
for
their
souls
Another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
To
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
Though
I
do
hate
him
as
I
do
hell
pains
Yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
I
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
Which
is
indeed
but
sign
That
you
shall
surely
find
him
Lead
to
the
Sagittary
the
raised
search
And
there
will
I
be
with
him
So
farewell
Exit
Enter
below
Brabantio
in
his
nightgown
and
Servants
with
torches
BRABANTIO
It
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
And
what
s
to
come
of
my
despised
time
Is
nought
but
bitterness
Now
Roderigo
Where
didst
thou
see
her
O
unhappy
girl
With
the
Moor
say
st
thou
Who
would
be
a
father
How
didst
thou
know
twas
she
O
she
deceives
me
Past
thought
What
said
she
to
you
Get
more
tapers
Raise
all
my
kindred
Are
they
married
think
you
RODERIGO
Truly
I
think
they
are
BRABANTIO
O
heaven
How
got
she
out
O
treason
of
the
blood
Fathers
from
hence
trust
not
your
daughters
minds
By
what
you
see
them
act
Is
there
not
charms
By
which
the
property
of
youth
and
maidhood
May
be
abused
Have
you
not
read
Roderigo
Of
some
such
thing
RODERIGO
Yes
sir
I
have
indeed
BRABANTIO
Call
up
my
brother
O
would
you
had
had
her
Some
one
way
some
another
Do
you
know
Where
we
may
apprehend
her
and
the
Moor
RODERIGO
I
think
I
can
discover
him
if
you
please
To
get
good
guard
and
go
along
with
me
BRABANTIO
Pray
you
lead
on
At
every
house
I
ll
call
I
may
command
at
most
Get
weapons
ho
And
raise
some
special
officers
of
night
On
good
Roderigo
I
ll
deserve
your
pains
Exeunt
SCENE
II
Another
street
Enter
Othello
Iago
and
Attendants
with
torches
IAGO
Though
in
the
trade
of
war
I
have
slain
men
Yet
do
I
hold
it
very
stuff
o
the
conscience
To
do
no
contrived
murther
I
lack
iniquity
Sometimes
to
do
me
service
Nine
or
ten
times
I
had
thought
to
have
yerk
d
him
here
under
the
ribs
OTHELLO
Tis
better
as
it
is
IAGO
Nay
but
he
prated
And
spoke
such
scurvy
and
provoking
terms
Against
your
honor
That
with
the
little
godliness
I
have
I
did
full
hard
forbear
him
But
I
pray
you
sir
Are
you
fast
married
Be
assured
of
this
That
the
magnifico
is
much
beloved
And
hath
in
his
effect
a
voice
potential
As
double
as
the
Duke
s
He
will
divorce
you
Or
put
upon
you
what
restraint
and
grievance
The
law
with
all
his
might
to
enforce
it
on
Will
give
him
cable
OTHELLO
Let
him
do
his
spite
My
services
which
I
have
done
the
signiory
Shall
out
tongue
his
complaints
Tis
yet
to
know
Which
when
I
know
that
boasting
is
an
honor
I
shall
promulgate
I
fetch
my
life
and
being
From
men
of
royal
siege
and
my
demerits
May
speak
unbonneted
to
as
proud
a
fortune
As
this
that
I
have
reach
d
For
know
Iago
But
that
I
love
the
gentle
Desdemona
I
would
not
my
unhoused
free
condition
Put
into
circumscription
and
confine
For
the
sea
s
worth
But
look
What
lights
come
yond
IAGO
Those
are
the
raised
father
and
his
friends
You
were
best
go
in
OTHELLO
Not
I

must
be
found
My
parts

perfect
soul
Shall

And

appearance
Even
on
the
instant
OTHELLO
What
is
the
matter

you
CASSIO
Something
from
Cyprus
as
I
may
divine
It
is
a
business
of
some
heat
The
galleys
Have
sent
a
dozen
sequent
messengers
This
very
night
at
one
another
s
heels
And
many
of
the
consuls

met
Are

Duke

You

When

lodging

three
several
quests
To
search
you
out
OTHELLO
Tis
well
I
am
found
by
you
I
will

a
word
here
in
the
house
And

with
you
Exit
CASSIO
Ancient

IAGO
Faith

If

Come

Here

troop
to

for
you
IAGO
It

Brabantio
General

advised
He
comes
to
bad
intent
Enter
Brabantio
Roderigo
and
Officers
with
torches
and
weapons
OTHELLO
Holla
Stand

RODERIGO
Signior

is
the
Moor
BRABANTIO
Down

They

both
sides
IAGO
You
Roderigo
Come
sir
I
am
for
you
OTHELLO
Keep
up
your
bright
swords
for
the
dew
will
rust
them
Good
signior
you
shall
more
command
with
years
Than
with
your
weapons
BRABANTIO
O
thou
foul
thief
where
hast
thou
stow
d
my
daughter
Damn
d
as
thou
art
thou
hast
enchanted
her
For
I
ll
refer
me
to
all
things
of
sense
If
she
in
chains
of
magic
were
not
bound
Whether
a
maid
so
tender
fair
and
happy
So
opposite
to
marriage
that
she
shunn
d
The
wealthy
curled
darlings
of
our
nation
Would
ever
have
to
incur
a
general
mock
Run
from
her
guardage
to
the
sooty
bosom
Of
such
a
thing
as
thou
to
fear
not
to
delight
Judge
me
the
world
if
tis
not
gross
in
sense
That
thou
hast
practiced
on
her
with
foul
charms
Abused
her
delicate
youth
with
drugs
or
minerals
That
weaken
motion
I
ll
have
t
disputed
on
Tis
probable
and
palpable
to
thinking
I
therefore
apprehend
and
do
attach
thee
For
an
abuser
of
the
world
a
practicer
Of
arts
inhibited
and
out
of
warrant
Lay
hold
upon
him
If
he
do
resist
Subdue
him
at
his
peril
OTHELLO
Hold
your
hands
Both
you
of
my
inclining
and
the
rest
Were
it
my
cue
to
fight
I
should
have
known
it
Without
a
prompter
Where
will
you
that
I
go
To
answer
this
your
charge
BRABANTIO
To
prison
till
fit
time
Of
law
and
course
of
direct
session
Call
thee
to
answer
OTHELLO
What
if
I
do
obey
How
may
the
Duke
be
therewith
satisfied
Whose
messengers
are
here
about
my
side
Upon
some
present
business
of
the
state
To
bring
me
to
him

Mine

SCENE
III
A
council
chamber
The
Duke
and
Senators
sitting
at
a
table
Officers
attending
DUKE
There
is
no
composition
in
these
news
That
gives
them
credit
FIRST
SENATOR
Indeed
they
are
disproportion
d
My
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
DUKE
And
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
SECOND
SENATOR
And
mine
two
hundred
But
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
account
As
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
Tis
oft
with
difference
yet
do
they
all
confirm
A
Turkish
fleet
and
bearing
up
to
Cyprus
DUKE
Nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgement
I
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error
But
the
main
article
I
do
approve
In
fearful
sense
SAILOR
Within
What
ho
What
ho
What
ho
FIRST
OFFICER
A
messenger
from
the
galleys
Enter
Sailor
DUKE
Now
what
s
the
business
SAILOR
The
Turkish
preparation
makes
for
Rhodes
So
was
I
bid
report
here
to
the
state
By
Signior
Angelo
DUKE
How
say
you
by
this
change
FIRST
SENATOR
This
cannot
be
By
no
assay
of
reason
tis
a
pageant
To
keep
us
in
false
gaze
When
we
consider
The
importancy
of
Cyprus
to
the
Turk
And
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
That
as
it
more
concerns
the
Turk
than
Rhodes
So
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
For
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
But
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
That
Rhodes
is
dress
d
in
If
we
make
thought
of
this
We
must
not
think
the
Turk
is
so
unskillful
To
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
Neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
To
wake
and
wage
a
danger
profitless
DUKE
Nay
in
all
confidence
he
s
not
for
Rhodes
FIRST
OFFICER
Here
is
more
news
Enter
a
Messenger
MESSENGER
The
Ottomites
reverend
and
gracious
Steering
with
due
course
toward
the
isle
of
Rhodes
Have
there
injointed
them
with
an
after
fleet
FIRST
SENATOR
Ay
so
I
thought
How
many
as
you
guess
MESSENGER
Of
thirty
sail
and
now
they
do
re
stem
Their
backward
course
bearing
with
frank
appearance
Their
purposes
toward
Cyprus
Signior
Montano
Your
trusty
and
most
valiant
servitor
With
his
free
duty
recommends
you
thus
And
prays
you
to
believe
him
DUKE
Tis
certain
then
for
Cyprus
Marcus
Luccicos
is
not
he
in
town
FIRST
SENATOR
He
s
now
in
Florence
DUKE
Write
from
us
to
him

FIRST
SENATOR
Here
comes
Brabantio
and
the
valiant
Moor
Enter
Brabantio
Othello
Iago
Roderigo
and
Officers
DUKE
Valiant
Othello
we
must
straight
employ
you
Against
the
general
enemy
Ottoman
To
Brabantio
I
did
not
see
you
welcome
gentle
signior
We
lack
d
your
counsel
and
your
help
tonight
BRABANTIO
So
did
I
yours
Good
your
Grace
pardon
me
Neither
my
place
nor
aught
I
heard
of
business
Hath
raised
me
from
my
bed
nor
doth
the
general
care
Take
hold
on
me
for
my
particular
grief
Is
of
so
flood
gate
and
o
erbearing
nature
That
it
engluts
and
swallows
other
sorrows
And
it
is
still
itself
DUKE
Why
what
s
the
matter
BRABANTIO
My
daughter
O
my
daughter
ALL
Dead
BRABANTIO
Ay
to
me
She
is
abused
stol
n
from
me
and
corrupted
By
spells
and
medicines
bought
of
mountebanks
For
nature
so
preposterously
to
err
Being
not
deficient
blind
or
lame
of
sense
Sans
witchcraft
could
not
DUKE
Whoe
er
he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
Hath
thus
beguiled
your
daughter
of
herself
And
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
You
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
After
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
Stood
in
your
action
BRABANTIO
Humbly
I
thank
your
Grace
Here
is
the
man
this
Moor
whom
now
it
seems
Your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
Hath
hither
brought
ALL
We
are
very
sorry
for
t
DUKE
To
Othello
What
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
BRABANTIO
Nothing
but
this
is
so
OTHELLO
Most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
My
very
noble
and
approved
good
masters
That
I
have
ta
en
away
this
old
man
s
daughter
It
is
most
true
true
I
have
married
her
The
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
Hath
this
extent
no
more
Rude
am
I
in
my
speech
And
little
blest
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
For
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
Till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
used
Their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
And
little
of
this
great
world
can
I
speak
More
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
And
therefore
little
shall
I
grace
my
cause
In
speaking
for
myself
Yet
by
your
gracious
patience
I
will
a
round
unvarnish
d
tale
deliver
Of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
What
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
For
such
proceeding
I
am
charged
withal
I
won
his
daughter
BRABANTIO
A
maiden
never
bold
Of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
Blush
d
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
Of
years
of
country
credit
everything
To
fall
in
love
with
what
she
fear
d
to
look
on
It
is
judgement
maim
d
and
most
imperfect
That
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
Against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
To
find
out
practices
of
cunning
hell
Why
this
should
be
I
therefore
vouch
again
That
with
some
mixtures
powerful
o
er
the
blood
Or
with
some
dram
conjured
to
this
effect
He
wrought
upon
her
DUKE
To
vouch
this
is
no
proof
Without
more
certain
and
more
overt
test
Than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
Of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
FIRST
SENATOR
But
Othello
speak
Did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
Subdue
and
poison
this
young
maid
s
affections
Or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
As
soul
to
soul
affordeth
OTHELLO
I
do
beseech
you
Send
for
the
lady
to
the
Sagittary
And
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
If
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
The
trust
the
office
I
do
hold
of
you
Not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
Even
fall
upon
my
life
DUKE
Fetch
Desdemona
hither
OTHELLO
Ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
Exeunt
Iago
and
Attendants
And
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
I
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
So
justly
to
your
grave
ears
I
ll
present
How
I
did
thrive
in
this
fair
lady
s
love
And
she
in
mine
DUKE
Say
it
Othello
OTHELLO
Her
father
loved
me
oft
invited
me
Still
question
d
me
the
story
of
my
life
From
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
That
I
have
pass
d
I
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
To
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
Wherein
I
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
Of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
Of
hair
breadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
Of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
And
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
And
portance
in
my
travels
history
