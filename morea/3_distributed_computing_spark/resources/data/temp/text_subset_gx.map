Exit

III
Friar
Laurence
s
cell
Enter
Friar
Laurence
alone
with
a
basket
Friar
The
grey
ey
d
morn
smiles
on
the
frowning
night
Check
ring
the
Eastern
clouds
with
streaks
of
light
And
flecked
darkness
like
a
drunkard
reels
From
forth
day
s
path
and
Titan
s
fiery
wheels
Non
ere
the
sun
advance
his
burning
eye
The
day
to
cheer
and
night
s
dank
dew
to
dry
I
must
up
fill
this
osier
cage
of
ours
With
baleful
weeds
and
precious
juiced
flowers
The
earth
that
s
nature
s
mother
is
her
tomb
What
is
her
burying
gave
that
is
her
womb
And
from
her
womb
children
of
divers
kind
We
sucking
on
her
natural
bosom
find
Many
for
many
virtues
excellent
None
but
for
some
and
yet
all
different
O
mickle
is
the
powerful
grace
that
lies
In
plants
herbs
stones
and
their
true
qualities
For
naught
so
vile
that
on
the
earth
doth
live
But
to
the
earth
some
special
good
doth
give
Nor
aught
so
good
but
strain
d
from
that
fair
use
Revolts
from
true
birth
stumbling
on
abuse
Virtue
itself
turns
vice
being
misapplied
And
vice
sometime
s
by
action
dignified
Within
the
infant
rind
of
this
small
flower
Poison
hath
residence
and
medicine
power
For
this
being
smelt
with
that
part
cheers
each
part
Being
tasted
slays
all
senses
with
the
heart
Two
such
opposed
kings
encamp
them
still
In
man
as
well
as
herbs
grace
and
rude
will
And
where
the
worser
is
predominant
Full
soon
the
canker
death
eats
up
that
plant

Good

Friar
Benedicite
What
early

sweet
saluteth

Young

it
argues

So
soon
to
bid
good
morrow
to
thy

Care

his
watch
in
every
old
man

eye
And
where
care
lodges
sleep
will
never
lie
But
where
unbruised
youth
with
unstuff

brain
Doth
couch
his

there
golden
sleep
doth
reign
Therefore
thy
earliness
doth
me
assure
Thou

Or
if
not

Our

That

my
good

But
where

thou
been

Rom
I

tell
thee
ere
thou
ask
it
me
again
I
have
been
feasting
with
mine
enemy
Where
on
a
sudden
one
hath
wounded
me
That
s
by
me
wounded
Both
our
remedies
Within
thy

holy

I
bear
no
hatred

My

Friar
Be
plain
good
son
and
homely
in
thy
drift
Riddling
confession
finds

riddling
shrift
Rom
Then
plainly
know
my
heart
s
dear
love
is
set
On
the
fair
daughter
of
rich
Capulet
As
mine
on
hers
so
hers
is
set
on

And
all

thou
must
combine
By
holy
marriage
When

where

how
We
met

made
exchange
of
vow
I
ll
tell
thee

this
I
pray
That
thou
consent
to
marry
us
to

Friar
Holy
Saint
Francis
What
a
change
is
here
Is
Rosaline
that
thou
didst
love
so
dear
So
soon
forsaken
Young
men
s
love
then
lies
Not
truly
in
their
hearts
but
in
their
eyes
Jesu
Maria
What
a
deal
of
brine
Hath
wash
d
thy
sallow
cheeks
for
Rosaline
How
much
salt
water
thrown
away
in
waste
To
season
love
that
of
it
doth
not
taste
The
sun
not
yet
thy
sighs
from
heaven
clears
Thy
old
groans
ring
yet
in
mine
ancient
ears
Lo
here
upon
thy
cheek
the
stain
doth
sit
Of
an
old
tear
that
is
not

d
off
yet
If

these

thine
Thou

For

Thy

In

so
O
she
is
lame
Love
s
heralds
should
be
thoughts
Which
ten
times
faster
glide
than
the
sun
s
beams
Driving
back
shadows
over
low
ring
hills
Therefore
do
nimble
pinion
d
doves
draw
Love
And
therefore
hath
the
wind
swift
Cupid
wings
Now
is
the
sun
upon
the
highmost
hill
Of
this
day
s
journey
and
from
nine
till
twelve
Is
three
long
hours
yet
she
is
not
come
Had
she
affections
and
warm
youthful
blood
She
would
be
as
swift
in
motion
as
a
ball
My
words
would
bandy
her
to
my
sweet
love
And
his
to
me
But
old
folks
many
feign
as
they
were
dead
Unwieldy
slow
heavy
and
pale
as
lead
Enter
Nurse
and
Peter
O
God
she
comes
O
honey
nurse
what
news
Hast
thou
met
with
him
Send
thy
man
away
Nurse

at
the
gate
Exit

Now

sweet
nurse
O
Lord

Though

sad
yet

merrily
If

thou
shamest
the
music
of
sweet
news
By
playing
it
to
me
with
so
sour
a
face
Nurse
I

Jul
How
art
thou
out
of
breath
when

breath
To

that
thou
art
out
of
breath
The
excuse
that
thou
dost
make
in
this
delay
Is
longer
than

dost
excuse
Is

news
good
or
bad
Answer

that
Say

and
I
ll
stay

circumstance
Let
me
be
satisfied

foot
and

Exeunt
Scene
VI
Friar
Laurence
s
cell
Enter
Friar
Laurence
and
Romeo
Friar
So
smile
the
heavens
upon
this
holy
act
That
after
hours
with
sorrow
chide
us
not
Rom
Amen
amen
But
come
what
sorrow
can
It
cannot
countervail
the
exchange
of
joy
That
one
short
minute
gives
me
in
her
sight
Do
thou
but
close
our
hands
with
holy
words
Then
love
devouring
death
do
what
he
dare
It
is
enough
I
may
but
call
her
mine
Friar
These
violent
delights
have
violent
ends
And
in
their
triumph
die
like
fire
and
powder
Which
as
they
kiss
consume
The
sweetest
honey
Is
loathsome
in
his
own
deliciousness
And
in
the
taste
confounds
the
appetite
Therefore
love
moderately
long
love
doth
so
Too
swift
arrives
as
tardy
as
too
slow
Enter
Juliet
Here
comes
the
lady
O
so
light
a
foot
Will
ne
er
wear
out
the
everlasting
flint
A
lover
may
bestride
the
gossamer
That
idles
in
the
wanton
summer
air
And
yet
not
fall
so
light
is
vanity
Jul
Good
even
to
my
ghostly
confessor
Friar
Romeo
shall
thank
thee
daughter
for
us
both
Jul
As
much
to
him
else
is
his
thanks
too
much
Rom
Ah
Juliet
if
the
measure
of
thy
joy
Be
heap
d
like
mine
and
that
thy
skill
be
more
To
blazon
it
then
sweeten
with
thy
breath
This
neighbour
air
and
let
rich
music
s
tongue
Unfold
the
imagin
d
happiness
that
both
Receive
in
either
by
this
dear
encounter
Jul
Conceit
more
rich
in
matter
than
in
words
Brags
of
his
substance
not
of
ornament
They
are
but
beggars
that
can
count
their
worth
But
my
true
love
is
grown
to
such
excess
cannot
sum
up
sum
of
half
my
wealth
Friar
Come
come
with
me
and
we
will
make
short
work
For
by
your
leaves
you
shall
not
stay
alone
Till

Scene
I
A
public
place
Enter
Mercutio
Benvolio
and
Men
Ben
I
pray
thee
good
Mercutio
let
s
retire
The
day
is
hot
the
Capulets
abroad
And
if
we
meet
we
shall
not
scape
a
brawl
For
now
these
hot
days
is
the
mad
blood
stirring
Mer
Thou
art
like
one
of
these
fellows
that
when
he
enters
the
confines
of
a
tavern
claps
me
his
sword
upon
the
table
and
says
God
send
me
no
need
of
thee
and
by
the
operation
of
the
second
cup
draws
him
on
the
drawer
when
indeed
there
is
no
need
Ben
Am
I
like
such
a
fellow
Mer
Come
come
thou
art
as
hot
a
jack
in
thy
mood
as
any
in
Italy
and
as
soon
moved
to
be
moody
and
as
soon
moody
to
be
moved
Ben
And
what
to
Mer
Nay
an
there
were
two
such
we
should
have
none
shortly
for
one
would
kill
the
other
Thou
why
thou
wilt
quarrel
with
a
man
that
hath
a
hair
more
or
a
hair
less
in
his
beard
than
thou
hast
Thou
wilt
quarrel
with
a
man
for
cracking
nuts
having
no
other
reason
but
because
thou
hast
hazel
eyes
What
eye
but
such
an
eye
would
spy
out
such
a
quarrel
Thy
head
is
as
full
of
quarrels
as
an
egg
is
full
of
meat
and
yet
thy
head
hath
been
beaten
as
addle
as
an
egg
for
quarrelling
Thou
hast
quarrell
d
with
a
man
for
coughing
in
the
street
because
he
hath
wakened
thy
dog
that
hath
lain
asleep
in
the
sun
Didst
thou
not
fall
out
with
a
tailor
for
wearing
his
new
doublet
before
Easter
with
another
for
tying
his
new
shoes
with
an
old
riband
And
yet
thou
wilt
tutor
me
from
quarrelling
Ben
An
I
were
so
apt
to
quarrel
as
thou
art
any
man
should
buy
the
fee
simple
of
my
life
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
Mer
The
fee
simple
O
simple
Enter
Tybalt
and
others
Ben
By
my
head
here
come
the
Capulets
Mer
By
my
heel
I
care
not
Tyb
Follow
me
close
for
I
will
speak
to
them
Gentlemen
good
den
A
word
with
one
of
you
Mer
And
but
one
word
with
one
of
us
Couple
it
with
something
make
it
a
word
and
a
blow
Tyb
You
shall
find
me
apt
enough
to
that
sir
an
you
will
give
me
occasion
Mer
Could
you
not
take
some
occasion
without
giving
Tyb
Mercutio
thou
consortest
with
Romeo
Mer
Consort
What
dost
thou
make
us
minstrels
An

minstrels
of
us
look
to
hear
nothing
but
discords
Here
s
my
fiddlestick
here
s
that
shall
make
you
dance
Zounds
consort
Ben
We
talk
here
in
the
public
haunt
of
men
Either
withdraw
unto
some
private
place
And
reason
coldly
of
your
grievances
Or
else
depart
Here
all
eyes
gaze
on
us
Mer
Men
s
eyes
were
made
to
look
and
let
them
gaze
I
will
not
budge
for
no
man
s
pleasure
Enter
Romeo
Tyb
Well
peace
be
with
you
sir
Here
comes
my
man
Mer
But
I
ll
be
hang
d
sir
if
he
wear
your
livery
Marry
go
before
to
field

ll
be
your
follower
Your
worship
in
that
sense
may
call
him
man
Tyb
Romeo
the
love
I
bear
thee
can
afford
No
better
term
than
this
thou
art
a
villain
Rom
Tybalt
the
reason
that
I
have
to
love
thee
Doth
much
excuse
the
appertaining
rage
To
such
a
greeting
Villain
am
I
none
Therefore
farewell
I
see
thou
knowest
me
not
Tyb
Boy
this
shall
not
excuse
the
injuries
That
thou
hast
done
me
therefore
turn
and
draw
