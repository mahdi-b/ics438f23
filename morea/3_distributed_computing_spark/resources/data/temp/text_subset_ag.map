COUNTESS
Yes
Helen
you
might
be
my
daughter
in
law
God
shield

not
daughter
and

So
strive
upon
your
pulse
What
pale
again
My
fear
hath
catch
d
your
fondness
Now
I
see
The
myst
ry
of
your
loneliness
and
find
Your
salt
tears
head
Now
to
all
sense
tis
gross
You
love
my
son
invention
is
asham
d
Against
the
proclamation
of
thy
passion
To
say
thou
dost
not
Therefore
tell
me
true
But
tell
me
then
tis
so
for
look
thy
cheeks
Confess
it
th
one
to
th
other
and
thine
eyes
See
it
so
grossly
shown
in
thy
behaviours
That
in
their
kind
they
speak
it
only
sin
And
hellish
obstinacy
tie
thy
tongue
That
truth
should
be
suspected
Speak
is
t
so
If
it
be
so
you
have
wound
a
goodly
clew
If
it
be
not
forswear
t
howe
er
I
charge
thee
As
heaven
shall
work
in
me
for
thine
avail
To
tell
me
truly
HELENA
Good
madam
pardon
me
COUNTESS
Do
you
love
my
son
HELENA
Your
pardon
noble
mistress
COUNTESS
Love
you
my
son
HELENA
Do
not
you
love
him
madam
COUNTESS
Go
not
about
my
love
hath
in
t
a
bond
Whereof
the
world
takes
note
Come
come
disclose
The
state
of
your
affection
for
your
passions
Have
to
the
full
appeach
d
HELENA
Then
I
confess
Here
on
my
knee
before
high
heaven
and
you
That
before
you
and
next
unto
high
heaven
I
love
your
son
My
friends
were
poor
but
honest
so
s
my
love
Be
not
offended
for
it
hurts
not
him
That
he
is
lov
d
of
me
I
follow
him
not
By
any
token
of
presumptuous
suit
Nor
would
I
have
him
till
I
do
deserve
him
Yet
never
know
how
that
desert
should
be
I
know
I
love
in
vain
strive
against
hope
Yet
in
this
captious
and
intenible
sieve
I
still
pour
in
the
waters
of
my
love
And
lack
not
to
lose
still
Thus
Indian
like
Religious
in
mine
error
I
adore
The
sun
that
looks
upon
his
worshipper
But
knows
of
him
no
more
My
dearest
madam
Let
not
your
hate
encounter
with
my
love
For
loving
where
you
do
but
if
yourself
Whose
aged
honour
cites
a
virtuous
youth
Did
ever
in
so
true
a
flame
of
liking
Wish
chastely
and
love
dearly
that
your
Dian
Was
both
herself
and
Love
O
then
give
pity
To
her
whose
state
is
such
that
cannot
choose
But
lend
and
give
where
she
is
sure
to
lose
That
seeks
not
to
find
that
her
search
implies
But
riddle
like
lives
sweetly
where
she
dies
COUNTESS
Had
you
not
lately
an
intent
speak
truly
To
go
to
Paris
HELENA
Madam
I
had
COUNTESS
Wherefore
Tell
true
HELENA
I
will
tell
truth
by
grace
itself
I
swear
You
know
my
father
left
me
some
prescriptions
Of
rare
and
prov
d
effects
such
as
his
reading
And
manifest
experience
had
collected
For
general
sovereignty
and
that
he
will
d
me
In
heedfull
st
reservation
to
bestow
them
As
notes
whose
faculties
inclusive
were
More
than
they
were
in
note
Amongst
the
rest
There
is
a
remedy
approv
d
set
down
To
cure
the
desperate
languishings
whereof
The
King
is
render
d
lost
COUNTESS
This
was
your
motive
For
Paris
was
it
Speak
HELENA
My
lord
your
son
made
me
to
think
of
this
Else
Paris
and
the
medicine
and
the
King
Had
from
the
conversation
of
my
thoughts
Haply
been
absent
then
COUNTESS
But
think
you
Helen
If
you
should
tender
your
supposed
aid
He
would
receive
it
He
and
his
physicians
Are
of
a
mind
he
that
they
cannot
help
him
They
that
they
cannot
help
How
shall
they
credit
A
poor
unlearned
virgin
when
the
schools
Embowell
d
of
their
doctrine
have
let
off
The
danger
to
itself
HELENA
There
s
something
in
t
More
than
my
father
s
skill
which
was
the
great
st
Of
his
profession
that
his
good
receipt
Shall
for
my
legacy
be
sanctified
By
th
luckiest
stars
in
heaven
and
would
your
honour
But
give
me
leave
to
try
success
I
d
venture
The
well
lost
life
of
mine
on
his

By
such
a
day
and

COUNTESS
Dost
thou

Ay

Why

Means

To

Be

Could

That

able
to
breathe
life
into
a
stone
Quicken
a
rock
and
make
you
dance
canary
With
spritely
fire
and
motion
whose
simple
touch
Is
powerful
to
araise
King
Pepin
nay
To

And

If

Now
by
my
faith

honour
If
seriously
I
may
convey
my
thoughts
In
this
my
light
deliverance
I
have
spoke
With
one
that
in
her
sex
her
years
profession
Wisdom
and
constancy
hath
amaz
d
me
more
Than
I
dare
blame
my
weakness
Will

For
that
is

business
That
done
laugh

KING
Now

Bring

KING
This

LAFEU
Nay
come

ways
This
is
his
Majesty
say
your
mind
to
him
A
traitor
you
do
look
like
but
such
traitors
His
Majesty
seldom
fears
I
am
Cressid
s
uncle
That
dare
leave
two
together
Fare
you
well
Exit
KING
Now
fair
one
does
your
business
follow
us
HELENA
Ay
my
good
lord
Gerard
de
Narbon
was
my
father
In
what
he
did
profess
well
found
KING
I
knew
him
HELENA
The
rather
will
I
spare
my
praises
towards
him
Knowing
him
is
enough
On
s
bed
of
death
Many
receipts
he
gave
me
chiefly
one
Which
as
the
dearest
issue
of
his
practice
And
of
his
old
experience
th
only
darling
He
bade
me
store
up
as
a
triple
eye
Safer
than
mine
own
two
more
dear
I
have
so
And
hearing
your
high
Majesty
is
touch
d
With
that
malignant
cause
wherein
the
honour
Of
my
dear
father
s
gift
stands
chief
in
power
I
come
to
tender
it
and
my
appliance
With
all
bound
humbleness
KING
We
thank
you
maiden
But
may
not
be
so
credulous
of
cure
When
our
most
learned
doctors
leave
us
and
The
congregated
college
have
concluded
That
labouring
art
can
never
ransom
nature
From
her
inaidable
estate
I
say
we
must
not
So
stain
our
judgment
or
corrupt
our
hope
To
prostitute
our
past
cure
malady
To
empirics
or
to
dissever
so
Our
great
self
and
our
credit
to
esteem
A
senseless
help
when
help
past
sense
we
deem
HELENA
My
duty
then
shall
pay
me
for
my
pains
I
will
no
more
enforce
mine
office
on
you
Humbly
entreating
from
your
royal
thoughts
A
modest
one
to
bear
me
back
again
KING
I
cannot
give
thee
less
to
be
call
d
grateful
Thou
thought
st
to
help
me
and
such
thanks
I
give
As
one
near
death
to
those
that
wish
him
live
But
what
at
full
I
know
thou
know
st
no
part
I
knowing
all
my
peril
thou
no
art
HELENA
What
I
can
do
can
do
no
hurt
to
try
Since
you
set
up
your
rest
gainst
remedy
He
that
of
greatest
works
is
finisher
Oft
does
them
by
the
weakest
minister
So
holy
writ
in
babes
hath
judgment
shown
When
judges
have
been
babes
Great
floods
have
flown
From
simple
sources
and
great
seas
have
dried
When
miracles
have
by
the
greatest
been
denied
Oft
expectation
fails
and
most
oft
there
Where
most
it
promises
and
oft
it
hits
Where
hope
is
coldest
and
despair
most
fits
KING
I
must
not
hear
thee
Fare
thee
well
kind
maid
Thy
pains
not

d
must
by
thyself
be
paid
Proffers

for

It
is
not
so
with
Him
that
all
things
knows
As
tis
with
us
that
square
our
guess
by
shows
But
most
it
is
presumption
in
us
when
The
help
of
heaven
we
count
the
act
of
men
Dear
sir
to
my
endeavours
give
consent
Of
heaven
not
me
make
an
experiment
I
am
not
an
impostor
that
proclaim
Myself
against
the
level
of
mine
aim
But
know
I
think
and
think
I
know
most
sure
My

not

past

Art

Within

Enter
COUNTESS
and
CLOWN
COUNTESS
Come
on
sir
I
shall
now
put
you
to
the
height
of
your
breeding
CLOWN
I
will
show
myself
highly
fed
and
lowly
taught
I
know
my
business
is
but
to
the
court
COUNTESS
To
the
court
Why
what
place
make
you
special
when
you
put
off
that
with
such
contempt
But
to
the
court
CLOWN
Truly
madam
if
God
have
lent
a
man
any
manners
he
may
easily
put
it
off
at
court
He
that
cannot
make
a
leg
put
off
s
cap
kiss
his
hand
and
say
nothing
has
neither
leg
hands
lip
nor
cap
and
indeed
such
a
fellow
to
say
precisely
were
not
for
the
court
but
for
me
I
have
an
answer
will
serve
all
men
COUNTESS
Marry
that
s
a
bountiful
answer
that
fits
all
questions
CLOWN
It
is
like
a
barber
s
chair
that
fits
all
buttocks
the
pin
buttock
the
quatch
buttock
the
brawn
buttock
or
any
buttock
COUNTESS
Will
your
answer
serve
fit
to
all
questions
CLOWN
As
fit
as
ten
groats
is
for
the
hand
of
an
attorney
as
your
French
crown
for
your
taffety
punk
as
Tib
s
rush
for
Tom
s
forefinger
as
a
pancake
for
Shrove
Tuesday
a
morris
for
Mayday
as
the
nail
to
his
hole
the
cuckold
to
his
horn
as
a
scolding
quean
to
a
wrangling
knave
as
the
nun
s
lip
to
the
friar
s
mouth
nay
as
the
pudding
to
his
skin
COUNTESS
Have
you
I
say
an
answer
of
such
fitness
for
all
questions
CLOWN
From
below
your
duke
to
beneath
your
constable
it
will
fit
any
question
COUNTESS
It
must
be
an
answer
of
most
monstrous
size
that
must
fit
all
demands
CLOWN
But
a
trifle
neither
in
good
faith
if
the
learned
should
speak
truth
of
it
Here
it
is
and
all
that
belongs
to
t
Ask
me
if
I
am
a
courtier
it
shall
do
you
no
harm
to
learn
COUNTESS
To
be
young
again
if
we
could
I
will
be
a
fool
in
question
hoping
to
be
the
wiser
by
your
answer
I
pray
you
sir
are
you
a
courtier
CLOWN
O
Lord
sir
There
s
a
simple
putting
off
More
more
a
hundred
of

COUNTESS
Sir
I
am
a
poor
friend
of
yours
that
loves
you
CLOWN
O
Lord
sir
Thick
thick
spare
not
me
COUNTESS
I
think
sir
you
can
eat
none
of
this
homely
meat
CLOWN
O
Lord
sir
Nay
put
me
to
t
I
warrant
you
COUNTESS
You
were
lately
whipp
d
sir
as
I
think
CLOWN
O
Lord
sir
Spare
not
me
COUNTESS
Do
you
cry
O
Lord
sir
at
your
whipping
and
spare
not
me
Indeed
your
O
Lord
sir
is
very
sequent
to
your
whipping
You
would
answer
very
well
to
a
whipping
if
you
were
but
bound

CLOWN
I
ne

worse
luck
in
my
life
in

O
Lord
sir
I
see
thing

may
serve
long
but
not

ever
COUNTESS
I
play
the
noble
housewife
with

To
entertain
it
so
merrily
with
a
fool
CLOWN
O
Lord
sir
Why

again
COUNTESS
An
end

To
your
business
give
Helen
this
And
urge
her
to
a
present
answer
back
Commend
me
to
my
kinsmen
and
my

This

not
much
CLOWN
Not
much
commendation
to

COUNTESS
Not

You

Most

Paris
The
KING
S
palace
Enter
BERTRAM
LAFEU
and
PAROLLES
LAFEU
They
say
miracles
are
past
and
we
have
our
philosophical
persons
to
make
modern
and
familiar
things
supernatural
and
causeless
Hence
is
it
that
we
make
trifles
of
terrors
ensconcing
ourselves
into
seeming
knowledge
when
we
should
submit
ourselves
to
an
unknown
fear
PAROLLES
Why
tis
the
rarest
argument
of
wonder
that
hath
shot
out
in
our
latter
times
BERTRAM
And
so
tis
LAFEU
To
be
relinquish
d
of
the
artists
PAROLLES
So
I
say
both
of
Galen
and
Paracelsus
LAFEU
Of
all
the
learned

authentic
fellows

Right
so
I
say
LAFEU

Why

I

LAFEU
Not

Right

Uncertain
life

sure
death
PAROLLES
Just
you
say
well
so
would
I
have
said
LAFEU
I
may
truly
say
it
is
a
novelty
to
the
world
PAROLLES
It
is
indeed
If
you
will
have
it
in
showing
you
shall
read
it
in
what
do
ye
call
t
here
LAFEU
Reading
the
ballad
title
A
Showing
of
a
Heavenly
Effect
in
an
Earthly
Actor
PAROLLES
That
s
it
I
would
have
said
the
very

LAFEU
Why
your

not
lustier
Fore
me
I
speak
in

PAROLLES
Nay
tis
strange
tis
very
strange
that
is
the
brief
and
the
tedious
of
it
and
he
s
of
a
most
facinerious
spirit
that
will
not
acknowledge
it
to
be
the
LAFEU
Very
hand
of

PAROLLES
Ay
so
I
say
LAFEU
In
a
most
weak
PAROLLES
And
debile
minister
great
power
great
transcendence

should
indeed
give
