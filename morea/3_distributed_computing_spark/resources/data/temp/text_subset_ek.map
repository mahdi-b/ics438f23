Welcome

told
him

landed
He

told
him
you
were
coming
His
answer
was
The
worse
Of
Gloucester
s
treachery
And
of
the
loyal
service
of
his
son
When
I
inform
d
him
then
he
call
d
me
sot
And
told
me
I
had
turn
d
the
wrong
side
out
What
most
he
should
dislike
seems
pleasant
to
him
What
like
offensive
Gon
to
Edmund
Then
shall
you
go
no
further
It
is
the
cowish
terror
of
his
spirit
That
dares
not
undertake
He
ll
not
feel
wrongs
Which
tie
him
to

Our
wishes
on

May
prove
effects
Back
Edmund

A

Spare

Decline

This

Would

Conceive
