If

can
hide

from

with
a
blanket
or
put
the
moon
in

we
will
pay
him
tribute

no

CYMBELINE
You
must
know
Till
the

This

Caesar

Which
swell

it

stretch

CYMBELINE
Say
then
to
Caesar
Our
ancestor
was
that
Mulmutius
which
Ordain
d
our
laws
whose
use
the
sword
of
Caesar
Hath
too
much
mangled
whose
repair
and
franchise
Shall
by
the
power
we
hold
be
our
good
deed
Though
Rome
be
therefore
angry
Mulmutius
made
our
laws
Who
was
the
first
of
Britain
which
did
put
His
brows
within
a
golden
crown
and
call
d
Himself
a
king
LUCIUS
I
am
sorry
Cymbeline
That
I
am
to
pronounce
Augustus
Caesar
Caesar
that
hath
moe
kings
his
servants
than
Thyself
domestic
officers
thine
enemy
Receive
it
from
me
then
war
and
confusion
In
Caesar
s

pronounce
I
gainst
thee
look
For
fury
not
to
be
resisted
Thus
defied
I
thank
thee
for
myself
CYMBELINE
Thou
art
welcome
Caius
Thy
Caesar
knighted
me
my
youth
I
spent
Much
under
him
of
him
I
gather
d
honour
Which
he
to
seek
of
me
again
perforce
Behoves
me
keep
at
utterance
I
am
perfect
That
the
Pannonians
and
Dalmatians
for
Their
liberties
are
now
in
arms
a
precedent
Which
not
to
read
would
show
the
Britons
cold
So
Caesar
shall
not
find
them
LUCIUS
Let
proof
speak
CLOTEN
His
majesty
bids
you
welcome
Make
pastime
with
us
a
day
or
two
or
longer
If
you
seek
us
afterwards
in

you
shall
find
us
in

If

our

Do

A

my

Look
I

The

Fear

grief
Thy

Thou

PISANIO
Hence

Thou

And

Since

Wherefore

Mine

The

For

To

when
thou

PISANIO
But
to

To

Good

Hear
me
with

IMOGEN
Talk
thy

I

I

Nor

But
speak
PISANIO
Then
madam
I
thought
you
would
not
back
again
IMOGEN
Most
like
Bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
PISANIO
Not
so
neither
But
if
I
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
My
purpose
would
prove
well
It
cannot
be
But
that
my
master
is
abus
d
Some
villain
Ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
This
cursed
injury
IMOGEN
Some
Roman
courtezan
PISANIO
No
on
my
life
I
ll
give
but
notice
you
are
dead
and
send
him
Some
bloody
sign
of
it
for
tis
commanded
I
should
do
so
You
shall
be
miss
d
at
court
And
that
will
well
confirm
it
IMOGEN
Why
good
fellow
What
shall
I
do
the
while
where
bide
how
live
Or
in
my
life
what
comfort
when
I
am
Dead
to
my
husband
PISANIO
If
you
ll
back
to
th
court
IMOGEN
No
court
no
father
nor
no
more
ado
With
that
harsh
noble
simple
nothing
That
Cloten
whose
love
suit
hath
been
to
me
As
fearful
as
a
siege
PISANIO
If
not
at

Then
not
in

must
you
bide
IMOGEN
Where
then
Hath

Day

Are
they
not

in

I
th

Our

seems
as
of

In

PISANIO
I
am
most
glad
You
think
of
other
place
Th
ambassador
LUCIUS
the
Roman
comes
to
Milford
Haven
To

Now
if
you
could
wear
a
mind
Dark
as
your
fortune
is
and
but
disguise
That
which
t
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be
But
by
self
danger
you
should
tread
a
course
Pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
happily
near
The
residence
of
Posthumus
so
nigh
at
least
That
though
his
actions
were
not
visible
yet
Report
should
render
him
hourly
to
your
ear
As
truly
as
he
moves
IMOGEN
O
for
such
means
Though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
on
t
I
would
adventure
PISANIO
Well
then
here
s
the
point
You
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
Command
into
obedience
fear
and
niceness
The
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
Woman
it
pretty
self
into
a
waggish
courage
Ready
in
gibes
quick
answer
d
saucy
and
As
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
Nay
you
must
Forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
Exposing
it
but
O
the
harder
heart
Alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
Of
common
kissing
Titan
and
forget
Your
laboursome
and
dainty
trims
wherein
You
made
great
Juno
angry
IMOGEN
Nay
be
brief
I
see
into
thy
end
and
am
almost
A
