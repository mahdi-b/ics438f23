### Split apply

The Split-Apply-Combine paradigm is a data analysis strategy that
involves breaking a large dataset into smaller pieces, applying a
function to each piece, and then reassembling the results. This
approach simplifies complex operations and is highly useful in
analytics and data transformation tasks. The notebook can be obtained [here](resources/split_apply_combine_Panda.ipynb).
