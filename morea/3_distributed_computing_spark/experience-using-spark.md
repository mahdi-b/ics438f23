This set question is designed to provide you with some basic experience working with Spark. I strongly recommend you review the material covered in class before working through these questions. For your convenience, a Spark DataFrame-specific cheat sheet is available [here](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676302905/Marketing/Blog/PySpark_SQL_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).
We will explore these questions together in class.

The notebook can be downloaded [here](resources/spark_exercises.ipynb).
