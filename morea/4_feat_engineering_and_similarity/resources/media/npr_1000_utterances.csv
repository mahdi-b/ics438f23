57264,9,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","It's a 2,200-mile race. To give some sense of perspective, that's roughly the distance between Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas. They do it over the course of three weeks at very fast speeds. But incredibly, oftentimes the distance between first and second is somewhere between and one and three minutes."
57264,10,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","So for a top competitor like Lance to try to make up that much time -he's now 13 minutes, 26 seconds behind the current race leader, Cadel Evans of Australia. And even Lance said yesterday that for him, the -any chance of winning the tour has gone out the window. He still does have a teammate on his team, RadioShack team, American Levi Leipheimer currently in eighth place, two minutes, 14 seconds back. And Lance is going to do what he can to help Leipheimer do well."
57264,11,"NEAL CONAN, host","So in every team, presumably there's one star, one equivalent to Lance Armstrong and the other team - the rest of the teammates project him, do what they can to help him succeed?"
57264,12,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","That's right. Each team has nine riders. And what you have is basically the team leader, sort of your queen bee, and then eight worker bees working to keep that queen safe and happy for when the decisive moments of the race come. In cycling, a lot of the energy goes toward actually battling wind resistance. So if you're riding behind another rider, you can be using up to 30 percent less energy because you're in that slipstream of the rider who's battling the wind. So team riders will ride on the front, protect their leader. You'll often see a team member drift back to the team car to fetch water bottles to keep their leader well hydrated."
57264,13,"NEAL CONAN, host","So slipstream, this is like drafting in car racing, right?"
57264,14,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)",That's exactly right.
57264,15,"NEAL CONAN, host","And so the guy who's in back has an easier time. And even when there are people in front on a breakaway, for example, who are from different teams, three or four riders, you will see them switch back and forth rather congenially so the same person isn't in front all the time."
57264,16,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","That's right. There's a lot of deal making that can go on in those breakaways. And oftentimes, they'll share the work until a time when they've determined it's every man for himself. But up until then, they form a sort of de facto team. And then sometimes you can see they've actually decided who might be able to win the stage that day. And these wagers can be for anything, for future favors, for money, for other things that they determine are valuable."
57264,17,"NEAL CONAN, host","We're talking with Loren Mooney, the editor-in-chief of Bicycling Magazine. She's at our bureau in New York. Why do you watch the Tour de France? So we want to hear from our bicycling audience today. 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And we'll start with John(ph), John with us from San Francisco."
57264,18,JOHN (Caller),Hello.
57264,19,"NEAL CONAN, host","Hi, John."
57264,20,JOHN (Caller),"Yeah, the bicycle - or the Tour de France for me is just kind of the ultimate extension of what can be done with the bicycle. The bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation as far as energy spent for a single human being. And to me, the tour is just - takes it to the utmost what can - or what are the outer limits of what one man can do with this machine. It kind of puts it all at the very top limit of what's possible."
57264,21,"NEAL CONAN, host","The ultimate expression - the training that you have to do for this, John, though is pretty ferocious."
57264,22,JOHN (Caller),"That also. But if you try to think of how long it would take anyone to cover the same distance by foot or the amount of energy spent in any other way for these guys to go 3,000 miles in three weeks, it's kind of unfathomable without the machine itself."
57264,23,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","That's true. It's interesting, too, these guys, they are very efficient in their energy use. But the amount of energy that they're using for human capacity can be fairly stunning. These guys are burning anywhere between six and 9,000 calories every day just to move their bicycles over the terrain. Nine thousand calories is the upper limits on some of those more difficult mountain stages. And that's more than the average American should eat in four-plus days to give you some sense of scale. These guys turn into very high-burning engines, if you will."
57264,24,"NEAL CONAN, host","In other words, don't invite them out to dinner."
57264,25,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","Yeah. You'd be - if you have to pick up the tab, you'd be in some trouble for sure."
57264,26,"NEAL CONAN, host","John, thanks very much for the call."
57264,27,JOHN (Caller),Thank you.
57264,28,"NEAL CONAN, host","Bye-bye. There is also, as we mentioned, the training. But one of the aspects of the race that seems to startle a lot of people is they're riding through these little towns in France, for the most part, and people are standing right by the roadsides. There's no barriers. They just reach out and touch them, and sometimes they do."
57264,29,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","That's right. One of the very cool things about the sport is it does give the public a chance to really go face to face with the riders on the roadway. Sometimes on those steep climbs, you'll see just walls of people almost blocking the road and then moving back at the last second to let the riders slip through. Given the access that the fans have - and there can be, you know, hundreds of thousands, close to a million people on some of these larger mountainsides - it is remarkable that there's not more interference from fans."
57264,30,"NEAL CONAN, host","Let's go next to Marshall(ph), Marshall with us from Holland, Michigan."
57264,31,MARSHALL (Caller),"Hello. The reason I watch the Tour de France is because this is the best time for a cyclist like myself, an amateur racer, to enjoy top-notch live coverage. Otherwise, it's all by magazines or over the Internet."
57264,32,"NEAL CONAN, host","The magazines are, of course, brilliant."
57264,33,MARSHALL (Caller),Pardon?
57264,34,"NEAL CONAN, host",The magazines are brilliant.
57264,35,MARSHALL (Caller),"Magazines are brilliant, and I do have a subscription to Bicycling Magazine."
57264,36,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","Oh, okay."
57264,37,MARSHALL (Caller),"But it's the best because you have every type of racing that you can enjoy. You have the mountains. You have sprinting. And you have time trials. So no matter what kind of cyclist you are, you get to watch all the world's greatest cyclists in one, you know, one three-week race. And it's the best. It's - I devour it every night and find excuses to be at home during the day to watch it live."
57264,38,"NEAL CONAN, host","One of interesting things, Marshall, that I find is the races within the races. So you have races that are sprints and people competing for the sprint championship, and then races within the mountains and people competing to be the King of the Mountains."
57264,39,MARSHALL (Caller),"Those are great because it actually allows you to pay attention on individual stages more so than the overall. While the overall is the top prize, the King of the Mountains and the sprint's jersey, even the young rider jersey, which is the white jersey, are prized. And among sprinters, which is my favorite competition, that's awesome because the speed that they hit, 45, 47, almost 50 kilometers an hour for huge amount of wattage, it's just amazing."
57264,40,"NEAL CONAN, host","Hmm. Marshall, thanks very much for the phone call. Appreciate it."
57264,41,MARSHALL (Caller),You bet.
57264,42,"NEAL CONAN, host","The jerseys, he mentioned, of course, the yellow jersey is the overall leader, but the other categories have all jerseys of their own, Loren Mooney."
57264,43,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","Yeah, that's right. The yellow jersey, the overall leader, and that is the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the three weeks. The green sprinter's jersey, determined by points, often who has the best sprint at the end. But there are also some intermediate sprints during some stages. The polka dot jersey is for the best mountain climber. And the white jersey is for the best rider 25 years of age or under."
57264,44,"NEAL CONAN, host","Let's go next to Rick(ph), Rick with us from Denver."
57264,45,RICK (Caller),Hello. How are you today?
57264,46,"NEAL CONAN, host","Good, thanks."
57264,47,RICK (Caller),"Great. Hey, I just - I love hearing a show about the Tour de France and I truly love watching it. And as a former cyclist, I spent four years after high school, before I started college, racing bikes. But I would propose that there are two reasons why people love watching the tour, and I'd love to hear your guest's comments on these. Number one is the cinematography is incredible. I mean, you really - you don't just watch a bike race when you watch the tour each morning. You get a chance to see some of the most beautiful scenery. And just the way they present it on TV, it's much more than just a sporting event."
57264,48,RICK (Caller),"And the second reason I would propose people love watching the Tour de France is Mr. Phil Liggett. It's - the British gentleman who speaks to us each morning, not just about the race and the current riders whom he seems to know each one of them personally, but about the history of the race, the history of France, the history of cycling, the history of whatever you like. Phil just seems to have so many stories that fill what is a very long day."
57264,49,RICK (Caller),"I mean, these races on television are quite long. And yet, you never get bored because each time he starts speaking he's got another little tidbit to share with you. So..."
57264,50,"NEAL CONAN, host",Well...
57264,51,RICK (Caller),...I find that the cinematography and Phil just leave me gripped to the TV.
57264,52,"NEAL CONAN, host","I thought this call originally from the French Ministry of Tourism. But it turns out, of course, he was publicity department at Versus, so..."
57264,53,RICK (Caller),"Well, I would love to know what your guest thinks of my proposal that those are two reasons why people continue to watch the tour despite many of the troubles that the athletes seem to create for themselves."
57264,54,"NEAL CONAN, host",Loren?
57264,55,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","Yeah. I think that's right, particularly with the scenery of France. It is a true tour of the country. The route changes each year. Some years, it goes in a counterclockwise circle around France. This year going clockwise, where it's hitting the Alps mountains before the Pyrenees. And you're seeing tiny villages. You're seeing just breathtaking mountainscapes. You go into the Pyrenees, you see the Basque flags and the fans wearing orange, cheering."
57264,56,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","And also, the cinematography that they're using at this point is outstanding. You're seeing not only the wide shots from helicopters, but these cameramen on motorbikes within the race are the true daredevils of the race. They get some amazing footage."
57264,57,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","You're also seeing in some of the sprint stages now, they have a camera that goes alongside the racers at upwards of 50 miles an hour, sometimes at the very end to see the very last rocket ship efforts of the sprinters. So really covering it from all angles, again, getting up close, getting into the riders' faces at the moment of the action is pretty remarkable stuff."
57264,58,"NEAL CONAN, host","Rick, thanks very much for the call."
57264,59,RICK (Caller),Thank you.
57264,60,"NEAL CONAN, host","The current issue of Bicycling Magazine offers a 2010 Tour de France fans guide. Its editor-in-chief, Loren Mooney, is with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."
57264,61,"NEAL CONAN, host","And here's some emails that we have. This from Matt(ph) in Liverpool, New York. Personally, couldn't name five riders, but I love to see the French countryside. And this is from Amon(ph) in Sunnyvale, California. As an Irishman I was inspired by the great Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche in the 1980s. Roche began as a paperboy racing his friends delivering newspapers in Dublin when he was a kid. He went on to win the Tour de France in a dramatic finish against Spaniard Pedro Delgado in 1987, the first and only Irishman ever to do so."
57264,62,"NEAL CONAN, host","I'm 35 years old and still racing for the Los Gatos Club here in California, Greg LeMond's old club. So that's, of course, the other great American rider before Lance Armstrong."
57264,63,"NEAL CONAN, host","And this is from Greg(ph) in Oklahoma City. It's a sporting event like no other. Unlike any other sport, it involves individual team -individual and team goals, none of which can be realized without the other. It has history, courage, teamwork and a host of unpredictable variables. I watch every day on the edge of my couch. Let's see if can go next to - this is Sterling(ph), Sterling with us from St. Helena in California."
57264,64,STERLING (Caller),How are you all today?
57264,65,"NEAL CONAN, host","Very well, thanks."
57264,66,STERLING (Caller),"Fantastic. Loren, love your magazine. You know, I think one of the things that's - that one of your callers mentioned, you know, in the dual proposal, you do get to see such an amazing part of the world and you could see it in great detail. But I think the thing that really draws me is the community that gets created every year when the tour is broadcast. The communities of cyclists and triathletes out, you know, all throughout the United States all gather together and, you know, discuss this, talk about this."
57264,67,STERLING (Caller),"I was in a bike shop yesterday in Napa Valley and getting my bike work done and a 71-year-old woman walked in and said, you know, I want to buy a bike. You know, I was watching the tour and I want to get out on my bike. And, you know, I happen to have a 74-year-old mother who's got a Trek carbon bike and, you know, she's all inspired. And I think that's the thing that's so compelling is the sense of community, you know, these 20-something days create, you know, in the U.S."
57264,68,STERLING (Caller),"And it's not - you don't see that. I mean, I think you'd see that in the World Cup with football but - soccer, but you don't see that in any other sports where people get together and they're really - it's participatory as well."
57264,69,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, the sport, Loren Mooney, has a natural clubhouse, the bike shop."
57264,70,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","That's true. The bike shop is our clubhouse, sports bar, church, all in one for the cyclists. And I think you're absolutely right. You drew the World Cup analogy there. And I think that's a good one because cycling, much like soccer in the U.S., is rarely shown on television with, you know, with any - in any depth. And so, this is our time to celebrate much like you saw the rather large soccer community in the U.S. gathering in sports bars watching the World Cup."
57264,71,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","This is the time when the cyclists gather together, watch, stop by the bike shop afterward, get into friendly arguments. It's funny how many times just this year I have watched the Tour de France live on TV, then gone out for a bike ride and I see a lot of other cyclists leaving at the same time, knowing that they had just watched the stage as well and now are free for the rest of their day to go out and do their own bike ride."
57264,72,"NEAL CONAN, host","Sterling, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it."
57264,73,STERLING (Caller),Yeah.
57264,74,"NEAL CONAN, host","Email from Sean(ph) in Cleveland. The Tour de France reminds me of what the human body can achieve with massive amounts of dedication. Lance is my hero. All of these riders are my hero. And this is from Robert(ph) in Columbus, Ohio. Because it inspires me to write and because, quote, ""you're not having fun until you're not having fun."" And I suppose that last part is because it drives you to do things you didn't think you could do."
57264,75,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","Yeah, absolutely. I think the tour is widely called the most difficult endurance event in the world. It's funny when you look at some of these racers, you look at them at the beginning of the Tour de France and at the end of the Tour de France, it's to me not unlike when you see a president about to finish his eighth year, end of the second term of office. And you look back at a photograph of the first inauguration and you realize just how much the president has aged in those eight years."
57264,76,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)","You look at a Tour de France rider first day and then on the podium in Paris, and they almost look like a different person. They're very gaunt. Their whole body composition has changed just from having been through the rigors of the event."
57264,77,"NEAL CONAN, host","Loren Mooney, thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it."
57264,78,"Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)",Thank you.
57264,79,"NEAL CONAN, host",And good watching. Loren Mooney is editor-in-chief of Bicycling Magazine and joined us from our bureau in New York.
57264,80,"NEAL CONAN, host",I'm Neal Conan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Join us tomorrow.
58225,1,"NEAL CONAN, host",This is TALK OF THE NATION. Im Neal Conan in Washington.
58225,2,"NEAL CONAN, host","The U.S. Supreme Court handed down rulings in two important cases earlier today. First, in a seven-to-two decision, the high court agreed that the government can indefinitely hold convicts considered sexually dangerous, even after their prison terms are complete."
58225,3,"NEAL CONAN, host","In the second case, decided five to four, the court said it is cruel and unusual punishment to sentence minors to life without the possibility of parole if murder is not involved."
58225,4,"NEAL CONAN, host","Later in the program, a comic book also-ran sprints to the top of the movie box office charts. Glen Weldon joins us on ""Iron Man 2."" But first, the Supreme Court rulings."
58225,5,"NEAL CONAN, host","If either of these cases affects you, give us a call. Tell us how, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation via our website. Thats at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION."
58225,6,"NEAL CONAN, host","We begin with David Savage, who covers the court for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. He joins us today by phone from his office. David, always good to have you with us. Thanks for your time."
58225,7,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Hi, Neal."
58225,8,"NEAL CONAN, host",And let's take these one at a time. A solid majority ruled it's constitutional to hold a convict even after he completes his sentence.
58225,9,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Yes, and Neal, this case actually was not a dispute about what you might think it was about, which is: Is that fair?"
58225,10,"NEAL CONAN, host",Yeah.
58225,11,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","About 15 years ago, in a case from Kansas, the court upheld these after-the-fact punishments involving sexual criminals. They said that they were not retroactive, and it was not a violation of due process of law."
58225,12,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","So it's actually been clear for a while as a constitutional matter, as a matter of individual rights. The government could hold somebody after they served their term..."
58225,13,"NEAL CONAN, host",Because of what they might do.
58225,14,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Correct. Last year, however, a federal appeals court struck down the federal law on the grounds that Congress didn't have the authority to pass such a law. There is no federal police power, they say, and that Congress only has the powers that are in the Constitution, the power to regulate interstate commerce."
58225,15,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","What the court said today, with Stephen Breyer writing a very broad opinion, was that Congress can pass laws that are necessary and proper to carry out its aims. And he wrote an opinion that said any law that's sort of rationally related to some aim that Congress has, it is constitutional."
58225,41,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","You said it better, Neal."
75004,1,"LIANE HANSEN, host","The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends today. In the United States, 2008 likely will be remembered as a moderately bad year for storms. But in Cuba, this season will go down as perhaps the worst season ever. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story."
75004,2,JON HAMILTON,"Eight hurricanes formed in the North Atlantic and Caribbean this year. Three of them, all major storms, hit Cuba. Alexis Fernandez(ph) was in Baracoa, a city on the eastern tip of Cuba, when Hurricane Ike made landfall on September 7."
75004,3,Mr. ALEXIS FERNANDEZ (History Teacher),"(Through Translator) The waves were as high as top of the buildings, and some of those buildings were five stories high. This in turn started the destruction of homes, people's homes that were along the beach area. Homes that people had worked all their lives for were lost in a matter of minutes."
75004,4,JON HAMILTON,"Fernandez teaches history at the University in Baracoa. He says more than 6,000 homes were damaged and hundreds destroyed. Ike would go on to scour the entire length of Cuba before moving into the Gulf of Mexico. A couple of weeks earlier, Hurricane Gustav had plowed across the western part of the country. And in early November, Hurricane Paloma struck the central coast near Santa Cruz del Sur. Fernandez says it's been the worst year for hurricanes in his lifetime."
75004,5,Mr. ALEXIS FERNANDEZ (History Teacher),"(Through Translator) In the '60s, we suffered a lot from Hurricane Flora. There were great floods. There were hundreds of deaths. In this series of hurricanes, there's been a lot of economic damage. But in human life, it hasn't been as bad because the state has been able to control and help us evacuate, so that the damage in human lives is minimal."
75004,6,JON HAMILTON,"The storms did more than $10 billion of damage in Cuba and left tens of thousands homeless. But only a handful of people died. One reason is Cuba's highly organized evacuation system. Another reason is that Cuban meteorologists work closely with their U.S. counterparts to forecast and track storms. Cuba even allows U.S. hurricane hunter aircraft to fly into Cuban airspace. And then there's Cuba's chief hurricane forecaster, Jose Rubiera."
75004,7,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of hurricane forecaster Jose Rubiera on Cuban TV)
75004,8,JON HAMILTON,"That's Rubiera on Cuban television describing Ike. He's a fixture on Cuban TV anytime a storm is on the way, and viewers pay attention to his warnings. Caribbean nations with less expertise and infrastructure were badly hurt by hurricanes this season. In Haiti, hundreds of people died. In the U.S. this year, hurricanes struck Texas and Louisiana. Hurricane Ike regained much of its strength after passing over Cuba. Then it weakened to a category two storm before making landfall near Galveston, Texas. Even so, Ike killed more than 80 people in the U.S. and caused damage of more than $25 billion. Gerry Bell is the lead seasonal forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says there are several reasons Ike was so dangerous, even though its wind speeds weren't that high."
75004,9,"Dr. GERRY BELL (Meteorologist, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)","The tremendous storm surge, the very long track over water where the hurricane could really, really pile up the water, also the speed of movement of the storm. If it's a slow moving hurricane, it's going to stay over any given area longer and obviously increase the potential for more damage."
75004,10,JON HAMILTON,"Hurricane Gustav strengthened to a category three storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Officials evacuated New Orleans, and residents feared another Katrina. But Gustav ultimately weakened to a category two storm and veered west of New Orleans. At the start of the hurricane season, Gerry Bell had predicted a busy year. And he was right."
75004,11,"Dr. GERRY BELL (Meteorologist, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)","We had 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. And that's certainly consistent with what the forecasts were for a lot of activity this season."
75004,12,JON HAMILTON,"Bell says it's too soon to say much about next year, but he adds that the Atlantic is in a period of high hurricane activity that's likely to continue for another decade or more. Jon Hamilton, NPR News."
74884,1,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Not a week goes by there isn't some story about endangered newspapers or layoffs in the broadcasting and entertainment industry. Now there's bad news from the world of publishing, where major houses have laid off staff, restructured management, limited the number of manuscripts they buy. Charlotte Abbott is a contributing editor for Publishers Weekly and joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us."
74884,2,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)","Thanks for having me, Scott."
74884,3,"SCOTT SIMON, host","So, what's business like this year?"
74884,4,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)",Book sales have definitely slipped.
74884,5,"SCOTT SIMON, host",What's your analysis of what's driven sales down then?
74884,6,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)","Well, the general retail falloff, I think, has had a big, big effect. Interestingly, children's fiction is stronger than the rest of the book publishing categories. I think people do not feel that books are a luxury for children, perhaps the way they might for adults. And I also hear that libraries are seeing a lot of activities. So I think it's not that people are not reading, it's that they're not buying books and are finding other ways to get their reading fix satisfied, except in the case of children where they are buying books."
74884,7,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Well, that raises this question. We've seen the introduction of electronic readers - eBooks, the Kindle from Amazon, and the Sony Reader. How are they selling? Does this represent a whole new movement in the book industry?"
74884,8,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)","It does in some ways. I think it's very notable, certainly. And as far as price point goes, eBooks are certainly the cheaper option, coming in about six or seven dollars per book. EBook sales are up as much as 300 percent for many of the major houses. But that's in a context where eBooks are still representing still under about one percent of total book sales."
74884,9,"SCOTT SIMON, host",May I press you a bit about some of these new technologies?
74884,10,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)",Sure.
74884,11,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Because I can remember a time when people thought that, you know, nothing would replace the newspaper. And obviously, a lot of people have found some kind of replacement for newspapers - online and through other media. And then, you know, I've talked to recording industry executives who've said, we'd love to get out of the hardware business - you know, all the making CDs, making the tamperproof covers. Now, as I don't have to tell you, in books, to print them, to sell them is expensive and speculative. Can books really expect even for 10 years to not be subject to technological changes?"
63416,18,XENI JARDIN,"The software analysis all of those human factors and processes them with algorithms.  That information generally won't help right there, during that call, but Schaffer says it can be used to answer important questions companies may have."
63416,19,Ms. ROBIN SCHAFFER (NICE Systems),"What kinds of situations - what kind of topics are bringing up this kind of level of emotion.  And it could go down to the soft skills or particular agents that seem to have patterns of customers becoming more emotional.

63416,23,Mr. PHIL TSCHUDY (CUNA Mutual),"And I think ultimately consumers want that, and demands are higher than they have every been.  And so this is great tool for us to really understand what are customers want and then deliver on that - on those expectations."
63416,24,XENI JARDIN,"This idea sounds great, but there is some problems. Big companies want to cut costs, so more phone support has been outsourced to call centers overseas.  But the issue is that English may not be a first language for most of the reps answering phones.  And if a communication gap grows wider another automated solution probably won't go far enough to comfort the outraged and unhappy customer.  For NPR News, I'm Xeni Jardin."

We're here in Tucson, Arizona, and if you've ever visited this part of the country, you know it can get really hot.  And I'm not talking about the weather, I'm talking about the food from Jalapenos to Anaheim's, to Poblano's, folks in this part of that world have been spicing their food with chilies for centuries."
68175,1,"IRA FLATOW, host","But something I learned on this trip out West is that chilies don't just make food hot, there are lots of mild ones too that are used in cooking, and chilies have non-food uses too.  We'll talk about all the uses for chilies, you know, for example their signature chemical compound, capsaicin."
68175,2,"IRA FLATOW, host","That stuff that makes them hot is also used for a pain reliever.  I see your shaking your head, you knew that.  Yes.  And their color is used in cosmetics with lipsticks, did you know that too?  Well, well, what's about - that's why we're here for, to talk about chilies and everything that you ever wanted to know about chilies, so we're going to kick off the hour talking about chili peppers, what makes them hot and why do we like them."
68175,3,"IRA FLATOW, host","Why do we like something that's that hot for us, and burns or maybe doesn't burn our tongues?  And how are farmers and scientists working together to take the plants from seed to fruit and back to seed, then here we are.

68175,11,"IRA FLATOW, host","Thank you.  Ed, when we say chili?  What are we talking about?  It was a - it encompasses a lot of stuff, doesn't it?"
68175,12,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","It does.  Probably the simplest explanation for chili is obviously as a lot of countries have their own specific chilies, but here in The Southwest, long, green, once termed Anaheim, because they were so popular there around Anaheim, California. They responded to the cool weather and next to the ocean there..."
68175,13,"IRA FLATOW, host",Mm-hm.
68175,14,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","But long green chili, Dr. Paul Smith from U.C. Davis gave it that name, suggested that name some years ago.  So long, green chili indicates a relatively mild, flavorful chili."
68175,15,"IRA FLATOW, host","Mm-hm.  There are lots of different varieties and brands of things like that, that you can get?"
68175,16,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",Of the long green?
68175,17,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.

68670,1,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","The partial government shutdown appears to be coming to an end three days after it began. The breakthrough came when Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to fund the government until February 8. That's a little under three weeks from now. In exchange, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to take action on immigration. Beyond that, there aren't a lot of details. In a statement, President Trump said he's pleased the Democrats have come to their senses. He says once the government is funded, his administration will work toward a long-term deal on immigration but, quote, ""if and only if it's good for our country."""
68670,2,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is at the White House to talk about all of this. Hey, Mara."
68670,3,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE",Hi there.
68670,4,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","Just first to make sure we know what's happening, where do things stand now?"
68670,5,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","Where things stand now is that both houses of Congress have passed another short-term funding bill which gives Democrats, Republicans and the president a three-week reprieve. They now have until February 8 to figure out a deal on DACA, which is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This was protection from deportation for immigrants who were brought here as children, many of them illegally."
68670,6,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","President Trump has removed that protection, and he gave Congress until March 5 to figure out a solution, or else these DACA recipients would be subject to deportation. If a deal on DACA can't be reached by February 8, according to Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, his intention would be to let the issue go to the Senate floor."
68670,7,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","As we look back on these three days, this partial shutdown, I mean, which party comes out of the whole thing a winner?"
68670,8,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","The White House feels very confident that they won this round. The Trump campaign is already sending around a fundraising email saying Democrats caved. The president's son on Fox today said the shutdown has been good for us. And it's true. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, didn't get that much when he agreed to this deal except for an extension of the Children's Health Program for six years. And a lot of left-wing groups who are part of the Democrats' base agree with the White House. They think Schumer gave in too easily."
68670,9,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","But whatever the political victory for the Republicans is, it's probably a short-term one because when the conversation was about shutting down the government on behalf of people in the country illegally, Democrats were losing the debate. But when the conversation turns back to what should be done about DACA recipients, Democrats are on firmer ground because vast majorities of Americans think those young people should have a path to citizenship."
68670,10,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","One of the issues that was reported - that came out that, you know, Democrats and Republicans didn't necessarily know where President Trump stood on this. And Senator Schumer said over the weekend, negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O. I think what - people are wondering why the president wasn't more involved in the conversation."
68670,11,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","Well, that's a good question, and the White House was very intent on pushing back against this notion that the president was a kind of bystander and uninvolved in the weekend negotiations over the shutdown. Here's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders."
68670,12,_NO_SPEAKER,(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
68670,13,SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS,Look; what the president did clearly worked. The vote just came in 81-18. I would say that those numbers are much more in the president's favor than in Senator Schumer's favor.
68670,14,"MARA LIASSON, BYLINE","So we still don't know exactly what the president wants in a final deal, but we know at least in terms of this particular skirmish the president got a tactical victory. He gets to take credit, which he really likes to do."

And then also for business travelers - again an audience with disposable income, who is space conscious and technologically adept."
74884,13,"Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)","I do agree that there are certain kinds of books that may find their audiences eroded. We've already seen this. A certain kind of current affairs book - you know, the torn from the headlines story - enough of that is available on TV or in excerpts or online. People can blog now and tell their story directly to their audience. They don't have to have the intervention of a book, the way that they used to. So I do see some erosion there. I do see that there will continue to be an audience and a readership for books as objects as well. The book is still a technology that works really well.

75394,1,"MADELEINE BRAND, host","From NPR West, this is DAY TO DAY.  Alex Chadwick is away.  I'm Madeleine      Brand."
75394,2,"MADELEINE BRAND, host","Coming up, why Democrats are divided on Iraq.  But first, minutes before      today's midnight deadline, the Iraqi parliament has reviewed a draft      constitution, but they've concluded that there are still outstanding      issues left to be resolved, and they say they'll take the next three days      to do that. Dan Murphy is a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor in      Baghdad.  I spoke with him earlier about the remaining issues."
75394,3,"MADELEINE BRAND, host","The main stumbling blocks, as we know them, are federalism, the      role of Islam, especially the rights of women, and how to distribute the      oil wealth in Iraq.  Has there been any progress in the last week on any      of those issues?"
75394,4,Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor),"It depends on who you're      talking to.  You're right that those are the main stumbling blocks, but      an additional main stumbling block is the Sunni Arab minority, who are      very underrepresented in parliament.  And, of course, Sunni Arabs are      behind most of the insurgent activity here.  And they don't want to sign      off on a constitution.  There seems as if there's been a progress between      Kurds and Shiites who are sort of the dominant political forces in this      process.  The Sunnis don't want to sign off at all, and so as we go      towards this deadline in a few hours here, the Kurds and the Shiites are      talking to the press and saying, `We think we've got it all stitched up.      We've got a draft we can live with,' and the Sunnis are saying, `No way.      If you push this through over our heads, there's going to be more blood      here.  Please don't do this.'  What we don't know is whether or not the      Shiites and the Kurds will push ahead on that basis."
75394,5,"MADELEINE BRAND, host","Well, speaking of more blood and more violence, you've written      that some political observers say there's a de facto civil war going on      in Iraq, and that one way to address that is to put some sort of peace      treaty in this constitution.  Is there any move to do that?"
75394,6,Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor),"Well, there is a civil war here.  I don't know what anybody      would call it if not that.  But the problem is is that usually, you know,      constitutions are written and new compacts are made about the nature of      states when the wars end.  It's very unusual for these sorts of things to      be sorted out right now.  I don't think there's any chance that this      constitution--if it is, in fact, finished today or in the next week--is      going to be satisfying to the warring parties here.  While we do have      Sunnis sitting at the table negotiating with Kurds and Shiites, it's not      clear to us if any of them, or how many of them, represent the people on      the Sunni Arab side who are carrying guns and fighting in the insurgency      here.  So even if they end up cutting deals with the Kurd and Shiite      partners here, it's not clear that that's going to see other Sunni Arabs      put their guns down.  So we're a long way away from the sort of peace      process and the peace compact that a place like Iraq would need to      stabilize."
75394,7,"MADELEINE BRAND, host","Well, is there anything that those Sunni Arabs would want to see      done with this constitution, or are they so far out of the political      process it doesn't matter?"
75394,8,Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor),"I mean, there's two problems for them.  Number one is      they're aware that they have a very, almost nihilistically violent side      to their own constituency, and they're, frankly, afraid of getting killed      if they sign anything away that's going to be unpopular with those people      who very well may be a minority but a very powerful minority at the      moment."
75394,9,Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor),"The other issue is is that Sunnis didn't participate in the January 30th      elections.  So in this process and in this interim parliament, you know,      they count almost no seats at all, and they probably make up anywhere      from 20 to 30 percent of the population.  What they would really like is      to delay and delay and delay until this interim parliament collapses and      new elections are held so that they could have an election, participate      in that election in greater numbers and have a lot more real political      influence.  Of course, that would be a disaster for the United States      because it would set us back to January effectively."
75394,10,"MADELEINE BRAND, host",So where is the US in all this?  Is it quietly behind the scenes      trying to pressure one side or the other to make concessions?
75394,11,Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor),"They're not so quietly behind the scenes.  Ambassador Zalmay      Khalilzad, who was in Afghanistan before and worked on the constitution      there, has been sitting--you know, he's probably spent 30 years sitting      down with these people in the past couple of days.  And he's in a very      interesting position.  On the one hand, the Bush administration, for      domestic political consumption, wants a fast deal as evidence of      progress, and that's why the keep emphasizing these deadlines.  And the      last deadline we wished last week was a sort of blow to the president."
70039,35,GLEN (Caller),I think she described it very well. I really do.

58225,16,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","I think this opinion was really about the health care mandate, which is coming up next. This is the first time in five years they've had a big case about the reach of federal power. Elena Kagan argued it, and everybody knew this case was  even though it was ostensibly about holding sex predators after their prison terms, the real dispute was the reach of federal power."
58225,17,"NEAL CONAN, host",So it was a proxy.
58225,18,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Yes, and John Roberts actually joined this opinion. It was a five-to-four opinion basically saying that Congress can enact laws that are intended to  that are sort of necessary to carry out their aims."
58225,19,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","And if you think about the health care mandate debate, remember the argument is we need to mandate that all persons have health insurance. That's a necessary condition to regulate the national health insurance market."
58225,20,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Everybody agrees that Congress can regulate a market. The question was, can they also regulate sort of individuals and say, you must have insurance. And I would read this opinion today as basically five of them saying that Congress has very broad authority for things like this."
58225,21,"NEAL CONAN, host",And those most opposed were Clarence Thomas and Mr. Scalia.
58225,22,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Yes, they have the sort of small-government, small-Constitution view. It's the kind of thing you hear the Tea Party people saying, you know, that the Constitution created a federal government with limited powers and only those limited powers. You know, you hear that all the time, and Scalia and Thomas basically said that, that Congress has certain limited powers, but we're not going to allow it just to willy-nilly to regulate aspects of American life."
58225,23,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","But as you said, this is a seven-to-two  only Scalia and Thomas voiced that view."
58225,24,"NEAL CONAN, host","So if that seven-to-two majority is predictive, the health care law, well, it may not be that predictive, you never know."
58225,25,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","That's right, you never know. But I would sure think - there's a lot of language. When this case goes into court, and I think it's in the court in Florida already..."
58225,26,"NEAL CONAN, host",Yes.
58225,27,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","The Obama administration is going to cite this opinion and this language as saying, see, the Supreme Court just this year has said Congress has this broad authority to pass laws that are necessary for carrying out its purposes."
58225,28,"NEAL CONAN, host","Now let's get on to the second case, and that involved minors who are sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in cases that do not involve homicides. And as I read the decision, this was sort of a follow-on to the ruling, what, just a year or so ago, that  some time ago  that minors could not be put to death because of psychological issues. Their brains are not fully developed."
58225,29,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Yes, that's right, Neal. It's very much the same thinking and very much the same justice. Justice Kennedy wrote both opinions, and in both cases, he stressed that teenagers, minors, are not fully formed. Yes, they can be punished, yes they can be dangerous people, but we should take into account their youth."
58225,30,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","And in the case of the juveniles who commit murder, Kennedy said its - they are not the worst of the worst and should not be sentenced to death. In this case, it involved life without parole for crimes that  it was like robbery or assault, that did not involve murder."
58225,31,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","I must say, this case came up last fall, and until it came up, I didn't know there was such a thing in the United States. There are 77 such inmates in Florida prisons, that is 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds that committed crimes like an assault or a robbery. A judge got really angry at them and said, look, you've been in here for a couple crimes before, I think you're hopeless. I'm going to sentence you to life in prison without the possibility of parole."
58225,32,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","The Supreme Court said today that's cruel and unusual punishment. It doesn't mean all these young men go free, it just means they're entitled to have a hearing somewhere down the road to see if they've been sufficiently rehabilitated that they can be released."
58225,33,"NEAL CONAN, host","So they would have to go before a parole board, and they would have to approve the release."
58225,34,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","That's correct. All this says is that you can't shut the prison door forever and say, never again can you have a hearing. They're entitled to a parole hearing to say that theyre no longer dangerous."
58225,35,"NEAL CONAN, host",Would they have to be resentenced?
58225,36,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","I assume that the state  I dont know for sure. I assume all the states are going to have to go back and impose some different sentence because the court was quite clear today in saying this sentence, this - categorically, you may not sentence someone to life in prison without parole if the person was under 18 at the time of the crime and if the crime did not involve a murder."
58225,37,"NEAL CONAN, host","And what did  it was a five-to-four decision, so a close split. What did the minority say?"
58225,38,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","The three dissenters  I should say, by the way, John Roberts agreed with the majority in part. He said this young man's sentence was grossly disproportionate, was unconstitutional. He just didn't like setting a categorical rule for all of them."
58225,39,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","The three dissenters basically said, as they've said before, is that this is up to the states and the people, juries and judges. Cruel and unusual punishment, we should interpret it by what it meant 200 years ago, and it's clear that states could punish people, even put people to death, for relatively minor crimes. And therefore, we shouldnt second-guess the state's decision to impose these prison terms."
58225,40,"NEAL CONAN, host","Why should we nine justices in Washington think that we're better-suited to make these decisions than legislatures in Tallahassee or Sacramento, for that matter?"
58225,42,"NEAL CONAN, host","Okay. David Savage, this case, does it have broad implications like you suggest the first one did?"
58225,43,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Well, I don't think it's easy to say. The court has been  you know, this is the first time in a big way that they have put a categorical limit on prison terms. In the past, the Eighth Amendment has always been about the death penalty. But if you said to me, what's next down the road? You know, I don't see another case comes along that Justice Kennedy could go along with."
58225,44,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","He didn't want to hand down this decision in a case involving a juvenile who committed a murder. It had appeals to that effect, and the court always turns them down. So they took a case that's involved life terms for juveniles where there's no murder involved. So I don't see it immediately translating into, you know, another group or another category of cases."
58225,45,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, David Savage, thanks very much for your time, as always."
58225,46,"Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)","Thanks, Neal."
58225,47,"NEAL CONAN, host","David Savage covers the Supreme Court for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined us today by phone from his office there. In just a moment, we're going to be talking with advocates in both these cases, advocates who as it happens, both got the decisions they hoped to get, at least in part."
58225,48,"NEAL CONAN, host","We'd like to hear from those of you who are affected by these cases one way or the other. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org."
58225,49,"NEAL CONAN, host","We'll start here in Studio 3A with Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. They filed a brief in the case involving life sentences for juveniles with no chance of parole. The brief argued against those tough sentences for young offenders. Today, the court agreed. Marc Mauer with us. Thanks very much for your time."
58225,50,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)",Good to be here.
58225,51,"NEAL CONAN, host",And obviously you're happy with this decision.
58225,52,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","We are pleased. This is, you know, a very significant recognition that the so-called get-tough policies of the last several decades, they way they piled up both our criminal justice and juvenile justice systems, you know, have now gone well beyond what I think most Americans, you know, think is a reasonable way to respond to crimes committed by juveniles."
58225,53,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And we should note these were serious crimes, even though they were non-homicides. The question still becomes, though, you know, are juveniles the same as adults? And I think the court has clearly said, no, they're not."
58225,54,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And, you know, any parent who has a 13-year-old, you know, could answer that question, as well. You know, kids grow up. Kids change. This is a very (unintelligible)..."
58225,55,"NEAL CONAN, host","Impulse control is different. But nevertheless, individuals vary. Some of these kids may be fully formed."
58225,56,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","They certainly may be but, you know, that's the reason why we have restrictions on the right to vote at what age, what age you can drive a car, drink alcohol and all that. You know, there may be some 14-year-olds who can responsibly drink alcohol, but we're not really in a position to make that determination on a case-by-case basis, and so we have to set some sort of broad standard."
58225,57,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And in this case, you know, when the consequences are so severe, in particular, the court has recognized that we need to set, you know, set that broad standard that says beyond this, below this, it's just not reasonable."
58225,58,"NEAL CONAN, host","And so you have to come up with an arbitrary number, which in this case is 18."
58225,59,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Yes, and, you know, I think it's important to note that, you know, the outlier position of the United States in regard to use of juvenile life without parole, you know, in addition to the kids who are affected by this ruling today, the others, you know, serving life without parole for homicides as well, more than 2,000 sentenced for crimes committed when theyre under the age of 18. If you look around the world, there is literally not a single other case that's been identified in any other country where any juvenile under 18 is serving such a sentence."
58225,60,"NEAL CONAN, host","And only about 100 or so in this country, as I understand it."
58225,61,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)",Hundred and twenty-nine for non-homicides and more for homicides.
58225,62,"NEAL CONAN, host","And most of them, as we mentioned, in the state of Florida. Stay with us, if you would, Marc Mauer. We're also going to be joined by Stephen McAllister, solicitor general of Kansas, to talk about the other Supreme Court case today. And we'd like to hear your calls. If you're affected by either of these decisions, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."
58225,63,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of music)
58225,64,"NEAL CONAN, host",This is TALK OF THE NATION. Im Neal Conan in Washington.
58225,65,"NEAL CONAN, host","Two decisions by the Supreme Court today changed the rules today on who can be held in prison and for how long, and raise new questions about who decides. Sex offenders deemed dangerous can be held indefinitely even after their sentence ends, while juveniles who didn't kill anyone cannot be sentence to life without possibility of parole. The court ruled they must be considered for release."
58225,66,"NEAL CONAN, host","We'll talk with two people who filed briefs in those cases. If either of these cases affects you, give us a call, tell us how, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Thats at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION."
58225,67,"NEAL CONAN, host","Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, just to follow up on something we asked David Savage about a moment ago, will these  given this decision, will juveniles sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, will they have to be resentenced?"
58225,68,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Well, the court has basically said that every state that maintains some of these juveniles serving life without parole has to provide some kind of mechanism by which they can be considered for release at some point, to demonstrate they'd been rehabilitated, are good candidates for being released."
68175,55,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Good question.  Good question, Ira."
58225,69,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","So that may vary from place to play and all that. And importantly, too, there are only 11 states plus the federal system where these even apply, where we actually have juveniles serving these penalties for non-homicides, which I think was part of the court's assessment, as well, declining support, declining interest in maintaining this penalty."
58225,70,"NEAL CONAN, host","And let's bring on our other guest today. In the other notable high court ruling, U.S. v. Comstock, the Supreme Court ruled the federal government can hold convicts even after they serve their time if they are deemed sexually dangerous. Stephen McAllister, solicitor general of Kansas, he filed a brief arguing in favor of that federal law. He's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for your time today."
58225,71,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)",My pleasure.
58225,72,"NEAL CONAN, host",And you also are pleased with today's ruling.
58225,73,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","We're very pleased with the ruling, yes."
58225,74,"NEAL CONAN, host",And how many people fall into this category?
58225,75,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","It's not a large number. The federal system is likely to be pretty selective. The programs are long-term, they're intensive. They're very costly. That's one of the reasons the states wrote in this case that we favored the federal program as a complement to our own."
58225,76,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)",There are sort of inherent limits on how many individuals can be accommodated in these programs.
58225,77,"NEAL CONAN, host",Who decides when someone is sexually dangerous and therefore cannot be released?
58225,78,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Well, there's typically a screening mechanism for inmates who are about to be released, coming to their end of their sentence. In Kansas, for example, it's a group that includes people from the attorney general's office who look at inmates whose sentences meet the criteria to decide, but it's a very small fraction. It's a very selective process because we simply don't have unlimited resources to do this."
58225,79,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","So it's very selective and a very small percentage, but it is typically driven by the attorney general's office or, in this case, the Department of Justice will decide this particular individual is someone we will file a petition and seek to have him committed for further care and treatment."
58225,80,"NEAL CONAN, host","File a petition, does that have to go before a judge?"
58225,81,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Yes. There's a fairly elaborate process that goes with this. So it would be a petition filed by the government. There's typically appointment of counsel. There may be expert witnesses, proceedings in front of a judge or, in some of the states, in front of a jury, a very trial-like process to determine if this person meets the statutory criteria for civil commitment."
58225,82,"NEAL CONAN, host","And then at some point, do they have the possibility of parole? Can they re-apply for release?"
58225,83,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Well, they  under the state systems, very definitely. In fact, there's almost always an annual review that takes place and it could be the reviewers would suggest they may be ready, but also they typically have the right to petition on at least an annual basis to ask for release, saying my circumstances have changed, I should be released. Even though the government's not asking to let me go, I think I'm entitled to it. So there's a regular way to challenge that."
58225,84,"NEAL CONAN, host","As a practical matter, to your knowledge, has anybody been released under that program?"
58225,85,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","I don't  not under the federal program because it's really been on hold for this, but under the state program, some. It's not a high percentage and this tends to be, by the nature of it, a long-term process and not always, unfortunately, a successful process."
58225,86,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","I mean, one of Kansas' most notorious committees, who went to the Supreme Court, a fellow named Crane(ph), was eventually released from the program but is now serving time in a Missouri prison because when he got out, he committed more sexually violent offenses, and he's now in prison for the rest of his life."
58225,87,"NEAL CONAN, host","Wouldnt that not discourage people from, under any circumstances, releasing somebody?"
58225,88,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Well, I think there is some wariness and some reluctance. On the other hand, the people involved with the programs do typically believe strongly that there is the ability to treat, to make a difference, to improve these individuals. It's not a  it's not a schizophrenic kind of, it's not a drug-treated sort of situation. It's much more of a cognitive, a behavioral alteration, and that's part of the longer-term nature. But there are many out there who believe they can successfully treat these individuals."
58225,89,"NEAL CONAN, host","You are obviously here talking about the cases that you were involved in, but you're not unfamiliar with each others' cases. I wonder, Steven McAllister, your opinion on the ruling about juveniles."
58225,90,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Well, I think it's a very tricky case because you have the  you see the competing ways of interpreting the Eighth Amendment, and you can see the justices who say, look, it's very limited. We shouldnt be substituting basically our judgment for that of legislatures, even if it's a minority of states at this point who do it. There are still 37, I think, Justice Kennedy said, who authorize, maybe only 12 or 13 who actually do it. And it's a typical criticism in the Eighth Amendment context."
58225,91,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","On the other side of it, there is a lot of notions built into the system that the juvenile system is different in many, many ways..."
58225,92,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, these are kids convicted as adults."
58225,93,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","They're convicted as adults, but I mean, the point is they are juveniles when charged. And Justice Kennedy emphasized both the fact that they may have less culpability and also that these are not murders."
58225,94,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","So taking those into account, I certainly can understand where the court came down. Kansas is not one of those states that is imposing these sentences. So as a practical matter, I'm not terribly concerned, but the argument is fairly familiar between the two sides here."
58225,95,"NEAL CONAN, host","Marc Mauer, on the case involving sexual predators who can be held indefinitely, your opinion on that?"
68175,56,"IRA FLATOW, host","We used to not know anything about chili pepper, so we're..."
58225,96,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Well, you know, it raises the broader policy questions of how do we handle people whove committed serious sexual offense. And, you know, we know a couple things. One is that there's a broad spectrum of sexual offenses that people commit. You know, on one hand, we have the Peeping Toms. On the other hand, we have the serial rapists waiting in the bushes."
58225,97,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And, you know, if there's anything we've learned, it's that, you know, those behaviors, we need to do very different kinds of individualized responses depending on the severity and where that behavior comes from."
58225,98,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Secondly, we know that in far too many instances, the problem we have in the prison system, not even talking about civil commitment, is how limited the treatment is in the first place."
58225,99,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And, you know, the resources aren't there. The public interest isn't there. The legislative interest is not there. And so we spend enormous amounts of money keeping people confined when, at least in some of these cases, we probably could do a much better job."
58225,100,"NEAL CONAN, host","Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Linda's(ph) on the line from Mountain View in California."
58225,101,LINDA (Caller),Hello.
58225,102,"NEAL CONAN, host",Hi.
58225,103,LINDA (Caller),"I'm the mother of a child who was molested by a sexual predator, and I just wanted to share my story. In California, we have determinate sentencing. And so the person, even though there were multiple offenses, pled it down to two, which means he's not a candidate for three strikes you're out."
58225,104,LINDA (Caller),"At the end of his prison sentence, he was sent to the state hospital Atascadero. Without the doctor's permission and without any kind of an elaborate hearing, they gave him what is called an administrative law judge hearing. And the judge determined that he had the right to petition for release. And what the probation officer told me is because he had served his sentence, even though his doctor felt he should be held on what they call a 5150, danger to themself or others, the law judge said the hospital had to release him. And so he was released after about two years."
58225,105,"NEAL CONAN, host",And that was after one of the people he was - he attacked was your child?
58225,106,LINDA (Caller),Yes.
58225,107,"NEAL CONAN, host",That must be awful.
58225,108,LINDA (Caller),"And that had a huge effect on my child. My child is now 19, and this happened when he was three."
58225,109,"NEAL CONAN, host",And is it a he or a she?
58225,110,LINDA (Caller),He.
58225,111,"NEAL CONAN, host","He, does he continue to fear attack by this man?"
58225,112,LINDA (Caller),"I know he  yeah, he's at times said he would like to get a gun and shoot him. And it was 16 years ago."
58225,113,"NEAL CONAN, host",Sixteen years ago. So this is a very living case.
58225,114,LINDA (Caller),"Yeah, and he's had years and years of counseling."
58225,115,"NEAL CONAN, host","And to your knowledge, after his release, has he gone on to attack anyone else?"
58225,116,LINDA (Caller),"I'm not sure. He's a family member. This is the really sick part. He's a family member, and he continues to send birthday cards and Christmas cards to all my kids."
58225,117,"NEAL CONAN, host",Makes the trip to the mailbox difficult.
58225,118,LINDA (Caller),"Yeah, so I mean, I think the thing is he's still in complete denial, I'm pretty sure, that it was really that bad a thing that happened."
58225,119,"NEAL CONAN, host","Linda, thanks very much for your call, and thank you for sharing that. I know that wasn't easy."
58225,120,LINDA (Caller),Okay.
58225,121,"NEAL CONAN, host","Appreciate it. And Stephen McAllister, it's stories like that that make it so difficult to approach these cases. You would think that  again, this was not the issue today, the fairness of it, but you say, I finished my sentence, why are you still holding me?"
58225,122,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","Right, and it's complicated, but this was a lot of the argument that was sorted out in the Hendrix(ph) case almost 15 years ago. On the one hand, they finished their sentence. On the other hand, often these are multiple offenders and the people that are drawn into the commitment programs are not going to be typically first-time offenders."
58225,123,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)",The other problem is prosecution is also sometimes very difficult. A circumstance like she just described with a three-year-old victim would be a very difficult case in many ways to prosecute. And I think there is a perception that sometimes those sentences have been plea bargained down and so forth to be much lighter than perhaps they should've been.
58225,124,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","In the commitment  and Hendricks(ph) has made clear - not intended as a substitute for the criminal sentence. But on the other hand, it does serve the function of not only treating these individuals but also incapacitating them so that they cannot re-offend while they're in custody of the state or the federal government."
58225,125,"NEAL CONAN, host",Incapacitating them how?
58225,126,Solicitor General MCALLISTER,"In the sense that they're held in a secure facility while they receive treatment, so that they are not just out in the community, even on a sort of a release program or a probation or something."
58225,127,"NEAL CONAN, host",Let's go next to Beverly(ph). Beverly with us from Shaker Heights in Ohio.
58225,128,BEVERLY (Caller),Hi. I'm calling with a question about what percentage of the juveniles that are being held - the 77 juveniles that are being - currently being held with life sentences are African-Americans.
58225,129,"NEAL CONAN, host",Those are just the ones in Florida. That's life sentence without the possibility of parole. And let's return to Marc Mauer.
58225,130,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Yeah. Well, we do know that for life without parole, both for murder and non-murder, nationally, there are very disproportion rates of confinement for African-Americans and Latinos, far out of their proportion to the general population and somewhat higher than their proportion of the sort of regular, if you want to think of that, prison population."
68175,22,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Well, I think we kind of gave it that name.  Sounded good."
68175,23,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of laughter)
68175,125,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
58225,131,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","So very significant, and certainly that's true for these 77 kids in Florida, which is by far the leading state in the nation. Which raises questions of, you know, how are cases processed? Do these numbers just reflect criminal activity or does it reflect access to resources and decision making in the juvenile criminal justice systems?"
58225,132,BEVERLY (Caller),Mm-hmm. So you don't know what percentage of those 77 that are currently being held are African-American?
58225,133,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","You know, I don't have these figures in front of me, but I do know that it's a substantial percentage, certainly."
58225,134,BEVERLY (Caller),Thank you for taking my call.
58225,135,"NEAL CONAN, host","Okay, Beverly. Thanks very much. And I just wanted to follow up, briefly, on what David Savage was telling us earlier. He said he didn't see anywhere for this to go. Obviously, there are life sentences without the possibility of parole for minors that do involve homicides. Is that where you see this going?"
58225,136,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","Well, I think that's sort of the next logical step. You know, I think after 2005, when the Supreme Court banned the death penalty for juveniles, this became the next arena essentially. Now, five years later, we've made a significant in roads there, and so that would be the next logical step or - and also it's extremely long sentences for juveniles, as well. You know, some states that have made changes, Colorado and others, still impose 40-year prison terms for juveniles."
58225,137,"Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)","And, you know, the fundamental question still remains the same. You know, are our kids capable of change? How much time is enough? And, you know, at what point do we recognize the different culpability of juveniles and how do we take that into account?"
58225,138,"NEAL CONAN, host","Mark Mauer of the Sentencing Project. Also with us, Stephen McAllister, the solicitor general of Kansas."
58225,139,"NEAL CONAN, host",You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.
58225,140,"NEAL CONAN, host",And let's go next to Paul(ph). Paul with us here from the bay area in California.
58225,141,PAUL (Caller),Hello. Thank you for doing this program.
58225,142,"NEAL CONAN, host",Go ahead.
58225,143,PAUL (Caller),"We represent a client who is a black male, who is charged with - actually a third strike. This is his third strike though. He has no prior sexual assaults, and it's not against a minor. But he has AIDS, and so it makes our case very difficult for us to take it to trial, because if the jury got this case, they would convict him just on the fact that he knew he had AIDS for 15 years and he raped this woman who was disabled."
58225,144,"NEAL CONAN, host",And did - took no precautions - did not use a condom.
58225,145,PAUL (Caller),"Took no precautions as far as we know. We don't know, because the victim doesn't know and he won't talk to us about that."
58225,146,PAUL (Caller),"But I can understand this issue in the context of against children. The woman he attacked in this case was an adult and he's an adult. The group in the United States that has the highest rate of AIDS is young black girls due to gang rape by black males in the United States. And so it's like a death sentence, this AIDS issue. And people - a lot of people don't realize that black girls have the highest rate of death from AIDS due to this problem. And so I could see where the Supreme Court has probably considered that fact in their calculation."
58225,147,"NEAL CONAN, host","Did this come into it, Stephen McAllister, at all?"
58225,148,Solicitor General MCALLISTER,I'm not aware of whether anyone briefed that. I don't recall any mention of that.
58225,149,"NEAL CONAN, host",And you were there arguing your case but you didn't hear it.
58225,150,Solicitor General MCALLISTER,No.
58225,151,"NEAL CONAN, host","All right. Paul, obviously, you've got a difficult case in front of you. We wish you the best of luck."
58225,152,PAUL (Caller),Thank you...
58225,153,"NEAL CONAN, host",All right. Appreciate it.
58225,154,PAUL (Caller),...for doing the program.
58225,155,"NEAL CONAN, host","Okay. Thank you very much. And let me follow up, Stephen McAllister, the question of treatment. Is there treatment available in the prisons where these men are sentenced to the first place, and after they're held, are they sent to different facilities? Is treatment available there?"
58225,156,Solicitor General MCALLISTER,"Well, the answer is yes and yes. Although I think a comment was made earlier, sometimes what's available in prison is limited. And there are problems with prison treatment that are partly a result of this setting also. We've also been to the Supreme Court in different case involving an inmate who didn't want to participate in the prison treatment program. And when he lost privileges as a result, he argued that that was unconstitutional. I mean, so some inmates may want to take full advantage of prison treatment programs, but there are a significant number who don't want to participate and will not necessarily do so willingly or voluntarily. But it is available in, at least, limited forms."
58225,157,Solicitor General MCALLISTER,"Now, when they enter one of these civil commitment programs because it is not intended to be punitive and is not part of the criminal justice system, they are moved to a different facility. And so in Kansas, for example, it's a mental health facility. Now, it's, granted, somewhat prison-like and that it's got to be secure by the nature of these individuals, so it's not just a house on a quiet neighborhood street. I mean, it's still a prison-like facility, but they are not usually in contact with, and certainly not housed with a general prison population. They're completely segregated."
58225,158,"NEAL CONAN, host","Just very briefly, we only have a few seconds left, would you agree with David Savage's belief that this was, in some ways, a proxy for the health care case."
58225,159,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)","It's an interesting thought. I suppose it's a very  and I think this is why you had Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito peeling off in separate concurrences. The majority opinion is a very broad assertion of power under the necessary and proper cause. Whether if I will go along with that in a very different kind of setting, you know, it's hard to know. I wouldnt battle out on the outcome there. But it has - certainly would be a case that will be argued."
58225,160,"NEAL CONAN, host",Is Kansas one of the states that's filed suit against the circuit?
58225,161,"Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)",Kansas has declined to join that lawsuit.
68175,54,"IRA FLATOW, host",Right.  Can you tell how hot a chili is by the color?  If it's red chili versus a green chili?
58225,162,"NEAL CONAN, host","All right. Thank you very much for your time today. Stephen McAllister, solicitor general of Kansas, also teaches law at the University of Kansas, defended the United States in the U.S. v. Comstock case, with us here in Studio 3A. Also with us Mark Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project who wrote an amicus brief in the Graham v. Florida case."

They are preparing for this possible summit between President Trump and North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un. This comes after a dizzying few days. The U.S. spoke harshly of North Korea. Then North Korea responded. President Trump canceled the summit. North Korea's tone changed, and so did the president's tone."
58131,4,_NO_SPEAKER,(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
58131,5,PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP,I think there's a lot of goodwill. I think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done.
58131,6,"RACHEL MARTIN, HOST","Before all this activity, one U.S. official called the summit a coin toss. The same official now says it's better than a coin toss, though another official told reporters that it's going to be hard to be ready for this by June 12. Whenever it happens, the bigger question is, what is actually going to be on the table?"
58131,7,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",Reporter Anna Fifield is in Seoul for The Washington Post and joins us by Skype.
58131,8,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",Welcome to the program.
58131,9,ANNA FIFIELD,Thank you. It's great to be here.
58131,10,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","How hard was it to restart this meeting, so far as you can tell?"
58131,11,ANNA FIFIELD,"Well, it seems, like, not that hard. They're - everybody has swung into action to try to get the summit back on track. Obviously, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has been leading the charge there. But these two American teams are now in full action. We have one lot - diplomatic and NSC, Defense Department officials in South Korea and crossing over to North Korea to have talks about substance with the North Korean representatives. That means denuclearization. And meanwhile, we have a separate team on its way to Singapore to talk to North Koreans there about logistics for the meeting that's set to take place. So it certainly looks like everybody is going full steam ahead with the preparations for the summit."
58131,12,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",So part of the story after the president - President Trump's cancellation was that Moon Jae-in held this emergency meeting of his cabinet in the middle of the night and then suddenly showed up on the border with North Korea. That's some pretty quick action. Had the South Koreans been prepared for this sort of wild development?
58131,13,ANNA FIFIELD,"I think nobody was prepared for this sort of wild development. You know, President Moon had only been back in Seoul for 24 hours after visiting President Trump in the White House when the summit was, like, abruptly canceled. And the look on his face at that midnight meeting, you know, said it all. He was clearly shocked by this turn of events. But they swung into action immediately. And on Friday, President Moon and president - sorry, Kim Jong Un of North Korea talked. And they arranged to have this meeting the following day on Saturday face to face in Panmunjom in the DMZ, which is really kind of unprecedented to think this is only the fourth time in 18 years that the two Korean leaders have ever met, and they were able to pull it off with 24 hours' notice. So everybody seems to be swinging into action."
58131,14,"RACHEL MARTIN, HOST","Which is so extraordinary - right, Anna? - that actually, President Trump - an American president's action, would actually draw the two Koreas together even closer."
58131,15,ANNA FIFIELD,"Yes, exactly. I think - you know, clearly, Kim Jong Un wants to go ahead with this summit. The signals coming out of North Korea over the past few days have been very kind of positive in that direction. But also, Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, you know, he is really invested in this process. And he desperately wants this to work because the other option if diplomacy fails may be military action, and that would be devastating for South Korea and the capital of Seoul. So one analyst we spoke to likened Moon Jae-in to a ball boy in a tennis match. She said, you know, every time the ball gets stuck in the net between Kim and Trump, Moon Jae-in rushes in to get it out again."
58131,16,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Although if you're the president of a country, maybe not the image you really want. But, I guess, he really wants this summit. But let me ask - do the two sides agree, so far as you can tell, Anna, on what the goal is? Fundamentally, is North Korea ready to give up its nuclear weapons relatively quickly, which is what the U.S. wants?"
58131,17,ANNA FIFIELD,"We don't know about the relatively quickly part. President Moon has said repeatedly that they're prepared to talk a bit about denuclearization. But that very vague term has not been defined, and President Moon declined on Saturday to say whether that meant complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement, like the U.S. wants. So there still seems to be quite a big gap there on substance."
58131,18,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","And we've been told that the North Koreans speaking directly with the United States have never signed on to that goal. Anna Fifield of The Washington Post, thanks very much, really appreciate it."
58131,19,ANNA FIFIELD,Great to be here.
58131,20,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",She joins us by Skype. So what effect does President Trump's reversals on this and other issues have on American foreign relations?
58131,21,"RACHEL MARTIN, HOST","Yeah, because besides the about face on North Korea, the president has scrapped the nuclear deal with Iran, of course. He has reconsidered trade deals. And he recently walked back these penalties on the Chinese telecom company, ZTE. These were penalties that his own Commerce Department had ordered. They ordered them because this company had violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea."
58131,22,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley has been following all of this - I don't know - whiplash. Is that a good word for it, Scott?"
58131,23,"SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE","(Laughter) Good morning, Steve."
58131,24,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Hey, good morning. Do you see a strategy here?"
70039,40,"NEAL CONAN, host","You can write the ombudsman, by the way..."
68175,24,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","But, it really - it depicts some of the unique characteristics associated with the chili plants, particularly this type that Ed was describing, we call the Anaheim or sometimes the New Mexico-type chilies."
68175,25,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","And this is a characteristic that is consistent with basically any type of crop, that they have their own environmental parameters, environmental conditions that they best develop and produce under.  And whenever we take those kind of plants out of those optimum conditions, they can often times still grow, but they don't opt - they don't grow to an optimum type of condition with regard to yield and quality."
68175,26,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","This area is kind of what Ed and I referred to as the Chili Belt, or a lot of us do, is about 3500 to 4500 feet elevation.  And it runs along about a 32 degree north-latitude zone, extends in our case from Southeast Arizona across Southern New Mexico, into Far West Texas,, and the Northern part of Chihuahua, Mexico.  But, the whole area has those ranges of elevation in common, so it's a climatic and weather-type of conditions that are really, well, suitable."
68175,27,"IRA FLATOW, host",So the elevation is important?
68175,28,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Very much so, and it's really the temperatures and the climate, but elevation changes everything here in this desert."
68175,29,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
68175,30,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","For example, we're at about 2600 feet here in Tucson, from here to go west to the Colorado River, we drop down to about 150 feet anuma(ph), right above sea level. And we go to extend all the way up to about 4500 feet elevations in Southeast Arizona..."
68175,31,"IRA FLATOW, host",Mm-hm.
68175,32,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","(Unintelligible) farms in the Sulphur Springs Valley. FLATOW:  So it's a little cooler, a little wetter up there?"
68175,33,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Yes, exactly."
68175,34,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
68175,35,Mr. SILVERTOOT,"A little higher elevation.  Higher elevations mean you get a little bit more precipitation on an annual basis, and a little cooler temperatures."
68175,36,"IRA FLATOW, host","Mm-hm.  Gary Nabhan, where do chilies come from?  Chili peppers, are they native here?  Were they imported?  How did they get here?"
68175,37,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Well, the wild chilies called the chiltepines are right there in Southern Arizona, within about 40 miles of where you're standing.  But chilies are all over the Western Hemisphere, from Tucson all the way down into the country of Chile."
68175,38,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","And we have four domesticated species, some semi-cultivated things, and some other species,  a dozen other wild species.  But people have been cultivating them for about 8,000 years in Mexico, we think the origin of Capsicum annuum is somewhere south of Guadalajara."
68175,39,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","We don't know whether it was on the Western Coast of Mexico, or the Central Valleys, or the Caribbean Coast, but from there down is a probable center of origin of chilies for the most part that we grow in the United States.  We have a few exceptions..."
68175,40,"IRA FLATOW, host",Mm.
68175,41,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Like the Datil chili pepper in Florida and the Tabasco that are different species, but Ed and Jeff are correct that most of what we grow to United States is this species Capsicum annuum."
68175,42,"IRA FLATOW, host","And they've been part of people's diets for a longtime. When you dig up ancient sites, yeah..."
68175,43,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Well, the wild chilies predate even agriculture in the Southwest by 4,000 years.  We find them in caves, and what are affectionately called coprolites, the human manure remains in caves of prehistoric sites, and people can extract chili seeds out of those going back 8,000 years in the border land..."
68175,44,"IRA FLATOW, host",Mm.
68175,45,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")",Right in this chili belt that Jeff and Ed are describing.
68175,46,"IRA FLATOW, host","Ed, you breed chili peppers.  I have to say it's a great name for a chili pepper breeder.  Ed Curry."
68175,47,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of laughter)
68175,48,"IRA FLATOW, host","Chili pepper breeder.  What kind of traits do you look for?  I mean, give me the ABC's of breeding a chili pepper.  I mean, there a lot of different things you could choose for.  What do you select at?  What are you looking for?"
68175,49,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","We look for - specifically in the canning industry, we look to make it two wall.  I brought one here, obviously radio audience can't see it, but we look for a two-wall, slim-type chili which we've tried to make it a little bigger, a little girthier.  Specifically right now we're trying to make the skin thinner, we're looking for thinner skins, so there's less waste product to the canning industry.  We're looking for more yield.  How we got on the map, Phil V. and myself - Phil's just a renowned pepper breeder around the world. But how we got famous in this, quote unquote ""was by stabilizing the heat.""  And that variety was Arizona 20.  As this industry spread to the north and to the east and new connoisseurs of chili were coming in, it needed a standardized heat because you know yourself.  If you went to a restaurant one time and got a mild chili and you went the next time..."
68175,50,"IRA FLATOW, host",Right.
68175,51,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",And you got your head burned off.
68175,52,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
68175,53,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","So when we standardized, it may - that was one of the first characteristics we looked for."
68175,57,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","We Westerners don't either, especially those of us trying to make a living.  It - red doesn't mean hotter.  Red is only a state of maturity.  I said this on a Phoenix TV station some years ago.  You know, as a human, when you get old, you turn wrinkled while a chili turns red.  It's just, strictly, maturity.  The heat is - developed - the capsaicin oil is produced right on the placenta wall of the pepper and it comes down that placenta wall.  The further down the placenta wall, obviously, the hotter the pepper.  Many people think the seeds are hot.  Only true because the capsaicin is rubbed off on the seeds sometimes in processing.  The seed in, any of itself, is not hot.  It's strictly that oil that is developed along the placenta wall."
68175,58,"IRA FLATOW, host",So the oil is not in the seed then.
68175,59,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",No.
68175,60,"IRA FLATOW, host",It's in not the seed.
68175,61,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",No.  That's correct.  The oil - if you cut a pepper...
68175,62,"IRA FLATOW, host",Right.
68175,63,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","And I can cut one for the audience for the audience here.  If you cut a pepper, you're going to see that oil.  A little shiny blisters right along that placenta wall and there is so many uses for that.  And you'll probably ask questions later."
68175,64,"IRA FLATOW, host","Oh, you can tell us whenever you'd like to."
68175,65,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",OK.
68175,66,"IRA FLATOW, host","But let me ask you about this.  When you cut the wall, you release that hot oil.  How do you measure how hot?  Is there a terminology or standard for heat?"
68175,67,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",Scoville unit.
68175,68,"IRA FLATOW, host",Is there a guy named Scoville?
68175,69,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","A guy named, Scoville, many moons ago that developed it.  There's a HPLC tester that measures.  The beauty that God gave us in quantification is really neat because we're able to quantify heat.  And yesterday, we talked extensively with Annette(ph) about why is that important.  When you go to the store and you buy a bottle of salsa and it's more mild, medium or hot.  By standardizing that through the HPLC machine, we can actually give the custumer the same heat level in every jar."
68175,70,"IRA FLATOW, host",What's the range of Scoville units for those three categories?  Is there something like five to ten is one heat.  Ten to twenty something...
68175,71,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Typically, I don't know if I'll hit this exact.  But roughly, probably mild sauce is going to be 50 Scoville units.  Medium is probably going to be 150 to 200.  Hot is going to be 500.  Now, when you get out - when you get over here to New Mexico and Arizona - my friends at New Mexico State will all testify that, you know, it's a much - much, much hotter than that.  But typically, like your Pace Picante, your brand name, Picante sauces, are going to be in that range."
68175,72,"IRA FLATOW, host","All right.  We're going to take a break and come back and talk about - some more about chili peppers.  Maybe there'll be Scoville units on your menu someday to tell you how hot this stuff is.  We could start that instead of those little numbers of chilies lined up how hot it is.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back and talk more about chili peppers with Jeff Silvertooth, Ed Curry and Gary Nabhan.  And right here in Tucson.  Don't go away."
68175,73,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of music)
68175,74,"IRA FLATOW, host","You're listening to Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about the science of chili peppers with my guest Jeff Silvertooth, professor and head of Plant Sciences at the University of Arizona.  Ed Curry, farmer and owner of Curry Seed and Chili in Pearce, Arizona.  Gary Nabhan is a research scientist at the University of Arizona and author of ""Why Some Like it Hot: Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity.""  And Gary mentioned before - talked about a wild chili botanical reserve south of Tucson that is down there.  I want to introduce my next guest, Jean England Neubauer.  She is with us.  Anyway, welcome to Science Friday."
68175,75,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",Thank you.  It's great to have you here.
68175,76,"IRA FLATOW, host",Tell us about this reserve.
68175,77,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)","Well, actually, my family is head of the grazing rights on the Rock Corral Canyon down south of Tucson since 1900s.  And we also have a chili company called Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company.  So when Gary Nabhan came to me and he and some friends, they've been out researching and camping out in the desert and he said, I think up on your grazing reserve.  We found some very unusual chiltepins and I'd like to go in to call for cooperation and put together a biological reserve up there.  So we were very, very excited and happy to work with Gary."
68175,78,"IRA FLATOW, host",What do you do on the preserve?  What goes on there?
68175,79,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)","Well basically, it's just - is an effort to protect the environment where these chilies - these chiltepins are actually growing.  And one of - part of the research we did is because we have a cattle grazing operation up there.  We wanted to be sure that they could be compatible.  And Gary came to us and said that they're absolutely were compatible.  And essentially, they're just there for us to sort of take care of and make sure that nothing happens to them."
68175,80,"IRA FLATOW, host",Now chiltepins are some of the hottest chilies you can get.
68175,81,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",They're very hot.  They're very hot.
68175,82,"IRA FLATOW, host",They're way over the 500 number that (unintelligible).
68175,83,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)","You know, I'm not sure what's the Scoville on chiltepins."
68175,84,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Chiltepin is probably going to be in 50 to 100,000 range."
68175,85,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",There you go.
68175,86,"IRA FLATOW, host",Wow!
68175,87,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)","But they're great.  They're full of flavor and they are just wonderful.  You know, people use them sort of for medicinal purposes..."
68175,88,"IRA FLATOW, host",Right.
68175,89,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",In terms of firing up your menudo and things like that.  That's very good you.
68175,90,"IRA FLATOW, host",So you don't want to ever bite into one of these...
68175,91,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)","Oh, sure you can."
68175,92,"IRA FLATOW, host",(Unintelligible).
68175,93,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",I'm sure you can.  Sure you can.
68175,94,"IRA FLATOW, host",Without a glass...
68175,95,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",Yeah.  But you have to be careful.
68175,96,"IRA FLATOW, host",You have to be careful.
68175,97,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",Yeah.  You have to be really - you really need to love your hot chili.
68175,98,"IRA FLATOW, host",Thank you very much for taking time to talk with us today.
68175,99,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",Sure.
68175,100,"IRA FLATOW, host",We'll be ready for questions later.
68175,101,"Ms. JEAN ENGLAND NEUBAUER (Owner, Santa Cruz Chili and Spice Company)",Thank you.
68175,102,"IRA FLATOW, host",That's a hot chili pepper.
68175,103,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","As I think about, I'm not exactly for sure on that.  Habanero was 150 to 300,000.  But a chiltepin is very hot.  I don't know the number.  I'll be honest with you.  I don't know.  It is hot."
68175,104,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")",It's 50...
68175,105,"IRA FLATOW, host",Go ahead.
68175,106,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","It's 50 to 100,000, I think you hit it on the mark.  So it's..."
68175,107,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Thank you, Gary."
68175,108,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Several times less than the habanero is, of course, many less than this Bhut Jalokia chili.  That's the reigning king of heat, which is up over a million Scoville units now, and it's a chili from India."
68175,109,"IRA FLATOW, host",And people can eat that.  Gary...
68175,110,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")",Well...
68175,111,"IRA FLATOW, host","Gary, are there certain cultures that are able to eat, you know, hotter chilies than others?"
68175,112,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Cultures have become accustomed to this - to eating spicy food.  In tropical climates, we have a number of cultures that seem to have a predilection for spicy foods.  But there's something in the genes that make people non-tasters of certain bitter and spicy compounds, where other people - largely people from the northern latitudes - may be super tasters.  So, the same amount of Scoville units can affect two people, like my wife and I, very differently."
68175,113,"IRA FLATOW, host",1-800-989-8255.  Let's see if we can - let's see if we can go to the phones.  I got a couple of phone calls here.  And maybe get some questions about chili peppers.  Let's go to Patricio in Chicago.  Hi.  Welcome to Science Friday.
68175,114,PATRICIO (Caller),Hi.  How are you doing?
68175,115,"IRA FLATOW, host","Hi, there."
68175,116,PATRICIO (Caller),I was wondering if you could talk about the difference between hot chilies and spicy chilies.  It's been my experience that I like spicy because they're full of flavor and the hot ones are just burning.
68175,117,"IRA FLATOW, host","Hot spot.  All right, OK, anybody want to take on that one?  Jeff, Ed?"
68175,118,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Well, probably it's a function of taste and semantics a little bit.  Every type of chili has a different flavor with it.  They come from the flesh and the structure of the chili itself.  And so, a hot chili might just be, you know, let's say, 100 to 500 Scoville units - extremely hot.  Spicy chili would be even higher than that.  So it's probably just a matter or particular taste and preference."
68175,119,"IRA FLATOW, host","Gary, any comment?"
68175,120,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Well, there's many flavor compounds in chilies.  And most good chili breeders like these guys are going for the flavor not just the heat.  And so, we tend to spend an inordinate amount of time just talking about where they are on the Scoville scale that clearly, habenero or a jalapeno tastes very different from the fine, spicy chilies that are coming out of southeastern Arizona and New Mexico that I feel have been selected for flavor over decades."
68175,121,"IRA FLATOW, host","You know, we know that salsa has surpassed ketchup sales in this country.  Is that a good thing for bringing back some of these wild chili varieties, Gary, that may be dying up?"
68175,122,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Well, we have fragmented in declining populations of wild chilies where some of the land managers aren't as conscientious as Jean and her husband, and her mother and father before them who had been fine managers of the land where the wild chilies grow.  But we also know from our Renewing America's Food Traditions project that we have dozens of traditional heir-loomed chilies like the fish(ph) pepper and the datil chili pepper and chimayo and elwikei(ph) chilies from New Mexico that are now not only in decline,  there's fewer and fewer farmers growing them.  But we also know that they've been contaminated by accident, out crossing with other varieties, so they don't have the - always a characteristics that they were first bred for and known for.  Their skin thickness may change or their flavor may change due to this accidental out crossing with other varieties.  So, Renewing America's Food Traditions based at Slow Food U.S.A., is trying to get local communities to champion these different chili varieties as part of our cultural heritage, not just our natural heritage."
68175,123,"IRA FLATOW, host","Ed, are you more interested in looking for some of these wild chilies or breeding your own?  Are you breeding them, you know, in a new way or using the old Mendeleev sort of..."
68175,124,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Oh, definitely the old way."
68175,126,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Definitely.  Dr. Steve Hansen in New Mexico States works with this on possibly doing some transgenic things.  But it's - chili is very diverse genetically so, it's very difficult.  That has been a long process.  But let me back up on that flavor profile just a minute."
68175,127,"IRA FLATOW, host",Sure.
68175,128,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","To hit the nail on the head.  Thank you, Gary.  There's many flavor compounds.  Dr. Benvy, alone at Texas A&M, spent years working on flavor compounds and then Philby and myself - Phil made many crosses.  We took them to the farm, grew them out, segregated them, isolated them.  For instance, a chili ancho - if you're familiar with ancho or flavano(ph) - tends to have a high rate of chlorophyll in it.  It has a chlorophyll retainer gene.  That in itself causes it to be a deep dark green, gives it a different flavor.  But then there's starch genes or sugar genes that when you start combining those - the fellow that called in and asked about flavor versus heat, that's exactly - one of our challenges is, years ago when Arizona 20 that Phil bred became the standard of the industry, that was a great yielder, a great canner, and the heat level was very stable in it.  But the flavor was very bland."
68175,129,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","So, then they came back and he said, hey, can you guys improve the flavor?  So, through crossing - there's many, many ties.  But for instance, the wahil(ph).  The wahil chili is a high-oil content chili, dry and has a much different flavor than it does green.  We crossed the wahil with an Anaheim type, the Mexico 6 type, if you will.  And we got a complete different set of flavors out of that thing than we ever expected.  So breeding is so fun.  I feel so blessed to be able to work with Phil because through the years, we made so many crosses and seen so many different things.  But that flavor profile thing is really, really an interesting subject.  It is not just heat.  Heat is important."
68175,130,"IRA FLATOW, host",Right.
68175,131,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)",But it's not just heat.
68175,132,"IRA FLATOW, host","Jeff, we're here in the desert southwest and you mentioned that there was a - the chili belt.  But what if - if you had to depend just on the rain for growing chili here, would you be able to do that or you have to depend on irrigation?"
68175,133,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","We could probably keep a few plants alive, but we wouldn't do well with regard to yield and production from an agricultural standpoint.  You know, farmers like Ed would have a hard time making a living on what they would produce just from natural rainfall, which across the chili belt, there's approximately about 10 to 12 inches a year in terms of annual precipitation.  And these chilies actually require - and that's one of the projects we have right now, to find out how much water do they require, how do they - when do they require that water and what are the different rates of consumptive use that they have over the course of season.  It's about 32 to 35 inches of water that the plant actually uses as we call it through (unintelligible) transpiration or consumptive use out of the system."
68175,134,"IRA FLATOW, host",Uh huh.
68175,135,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)",Much more - a quite a bit more than what natural rainfall would provide.
68175,136,"IRA FLATOW, host","Oh yeah.  OK.  Question in the audience here, sir."
68175,137,Unidentified Man (Audience),I've always wondered what is - why do the wild chili plants have that heat?  What advantage does it have for them?  Does it attract fruit eating wild animals or detract them before the seeds are ripe?  Or what's the deal there?
68175,138,"IRA FLATOW, host","Gary, do you want to tackle that?"
68175,139,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Well, I've spent about 15 years of field time on that one with my buddy Jack Stutchbury who's been on Science Friday before.  And what we found is that those capsaicinoids pick one compounds in chilis repel mammals who would consume the seeds.  And also they repel or resist molding in the fruits, so that the seeds don't die that way, but ironically the seed dispersers of chilis, which are a number of birds including cardinals and pyrrhuloxias don't taste that heat.  So, ironically birds like some people are non-tasters of the capsaicinoids and so, they readily seek the chilis out for their oils and their flavor compounds that they do pick up.  And they benefit from the many rich vitamin compounds in chilis.  So, essentially I say, when my little son asked me why chilis are hot, I say so birds can disperse them to nurse trees and other critters will not."
68175,140,"IRA FLATOW, host","I tell you my squirrels have no problem with them and I've grow hot chilis I thought - in my pots on my backyard, and I thought this will keep the squirrels out.  But, boy, this is - they're chomping on the green chili just laugh at me as it's coming off the flask."
68175,141,Unidentified Man (Audience),Can I interrupt your...
68175,142,"IRA FLATOW, host",Sure.
68175,143,Unidentified Man (Audience),"Gary, I tell you an interesting story in our cayenne breeding blocks.  We had a problem with a particular cayenne that was too mild, and one year my farm manager came by and he said man, did you see the deer really ate riddle that cayenne  blocks.  Well, upon closer notice we found that the deer did us a great favor from a breathing stand point.  We were looking for hot.  They ate every mild cayenne plant out there and they left every hot one.  It saved us three or four years in breeding work."
68175,144,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of laughter)
68175,145,"IRA FLATOW, host",Wow.
68175,146,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","Well, let me tell you another story about this interaction between mammals and chilis.  When I worked at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the great natural history zoo outside at Tucson, we had tremendous bills for bird feed in the aviary out there.  And we realized that most of that bird seed wasn't being eaten by the birds at all that we are trying to interpret and present to the public, but that desert mice and house mice, and rats had gotten into the aviary and they were eating most of the food."
68175,147,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","So, we laced the birds seed with food and the next night and for the next week, the rats and mice just disappeared from that aviary and it was like chorus lines of mice and rats back in the desert again trying to find food because they've grown sort of accustomed to the bird seed.  And we basically reduced the desert museum bird seed budget by several hundred dollars a month by using the capsaicin to repel the small mammals."
68175,148,"IRA FLATOW, host","Uh huh.  You're listening to Talk of The Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow in Tucson.  And up the microphone, sir."
68175,149,MATTHEW (Audience),"Hi, there.  My name is Matthew, and I've live in Tucson now for four and a half years.  And this year, I tried to plant in my garden and only chilis because I wanted something easy.  And they're trickier than I would have thought that - I had a hard time making it through the summer heat, and like I have bunches of wilted ones now.  I think I over watered them.  I mean, I - what I would like to do is to take you to my house and get you the…"
68175,150,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of laughter)
68175,151,"IRA FLATOW, host","Well, let me (unintelligible)."
68175,152,MATTHEW (Audience),"But, my question generally is what's good for chilies and I mean how do I get them as big as the ones you brought in.  And I mean, but just generally what kind of conditions or other tricks that I can use to grow better chilies?"
68175,153,"IRA FLATOW, host",Jeff.
68175,154,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Actually, that's you've got - he had a good point there.  They are really sensitive plants, very sensitive plants. We talked about the climate conditions that they like and they're kind of particular about not too high and not too low, not too hot air conditions, but just hot enough.  And they're also very particular about their water requirements as well.  So in this case we described a while ago they use about 30 or 32 inches of water of over the year.  But, we call of (unintelligible) to its fill capacity, it's full of its water like after you irrigate and the water drains away, we call it fill capacity.  And as a soil it begins to dry.  It drops in as what we called plant available water level."
68175,155,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)","Now, chilies are sensitive. They'll only ever grow when it gets a little drier, but they like that range about 75 to 80 percent plant available level to fill capacity.  And now, you take another plant like say, squash plants or zucchini or tomatoes that you put in your garden as one they'll tolerate - a drier soil.  The chili plants are sensitive to too much stress, when you over water them and they're sensitive to that.  They have kind of - not really -what I call - I kind of make fun of them sometimes.  So they have kind of a little weak little root system.  They're hard working plants if you actually can get them to fruit and do well, and that's what this is really kind of cool about watching guys like Ed and the good farmers that are dealing this - they walk that fine line.  That kind of razors edge between not too much water, but just enough."
68175,156,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
68175,157,"Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)",And they're also sensitive to disease.
68175,158,"IRA FLATOW, host","I've only got one minute to get - to go.  Ed, I want to ask you what would be the perfect chili that you're looking for.  I'll give you a blank check.  What would you like to and how can you make it?"
68175,159,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Well, I brought that."
68175,160,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of laughter)
68175,161,"IRA FLATOW, host","Well, describe them.  What makes it so perfect?"
68175,162,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Two-walled, six, seven, eight inches long, a rounded shoulder, it needs to de-stem quite easily.  It needs - for the canning industry it needs to have a Scoville unit of 100 - a 50 to 150 no more that needs to be the range.  And a high yield for the farmer.  They will be able to set 15 to 25 peppers on one plant.  That would be the perfect pair for them - for the canning industry."
68175,163,"IRA FLATOW, host",So you're pretty happy with the industry now.
68175,164,"Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)","Oh my goodness.  We have so much left work to do.  We've got to live to be 150 years old to solve this thing, you know."

68175,166,"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")","And the issues I think is that we now we have all these other uses for chilies like you've said the pigments and my closing thought is that you can put pepper pigments on the pig, but it's still carne adobada."
68175,167,"IRA FLATOW, host","OK.  I can't top that.  I can't touch that, unless Jeff you want to weigh in.  But, we'll - quick, ten seconds."

58131,25,"SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE","I'm not sure there's a broad, overarching strategy. Instead, maybe what we're seeing is a lot of tactical moves by this president, reacting to events as they come, trying to be flexible. You hear that in the president's oft-repeated phrase, we'll see what happens. One point Trump did make in his book on deal-making is, you never want to seem too eager to be at the deal. That gives too much leverage to your - the person sitting across the table from you. So in walking away last week, he may have sort of recalibrated, made it clear that Kim Jong Un wants these talks at least as much, if not more than Trump does. And in that very personal breakup letter that we're told the president dictated himself, he did leave the door open for resumed talks. And here we are."
58131,26,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Well, sure he certainly did, although I want to ask about this, Scott. It's hard to overlook the fact that when the president makes these sudden shifts - one direction, then another, then back again - one of the things that he does is refocus attention on himself, makes himself the center of the story."
58131,27,"SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE","Yeah, the Trump show is the only show in town, and it's playing to a packed house every night. I think the president himself said something like that at one point. It's not easy, though, for the supporting players, whether we're talking about Moon Jae-in or U.S. allies or adversaries or even the president's own staff, Steve. You know, just last week, we had a senior White House official briefing reporters that it would be impossible to restart these talks in time to meet on June 12 in Singapore as originally scheduled. And then over the weekend, you had to president himself insisting that was a made-up source, that no one had said that, that the news media was inventing this, even though it was his own staffer who had made that point to reporters (unintelligible)."

58131,35,"RACHEL MARTIN, HOST","Right. That's how most cargo is moved around Brazil - a huge country - because it doesn't have much of a railway network. In the past week, though, you'd have been in trouble if you were trying to move things from point A to point B. Brazil's truckers have been on strike. This has caused shortages of fuel and food, and it has paralyzed much of the economy."
58131,36,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",NPR's Philip Reeves is in the center of it because he is in Rio de Janeiro.
58131,37,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Hey there, Phil."
58131,38,"PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE",Hi.
58131,39,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST",So what's it like to be in Brazil in the middle of a trucker strike?
58131,40,"PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE","Well, it's more dramatic than many people would have expected. The impact this is having on the public is huge. We're seeing empty shelves in stores due to shortages of perishable foods - fruit, eggs, vegetables and so on. We're seeing very long lines at gas stations. You know, some people are sleeping in their cars overnight to get gas. Some gas stations actually closed over the weekend because their supplies ran out. Today, many schools are shut because public transport's in disarray. Flights in recent days have been scaled back. And it's worth remembering that Brazil's a huge exporter of poultry, and poultry producers have had to destroy more than 60 million birds because of the shortage of feed."
58131,41,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Oh, because they can't get the feed - amazing. And they probably can't even move the birds when they need to be moved. So why are the truckers going on strike?"
58131,42,"PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE",It's about the cost of fuel. This has gone up a lot thanks to rising international oil prices and the sharp depreciation of Brazil's currency recently against the dollar. Truckers say that means their operating costs are too high.
58131,43,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","So let me just ask, Phil, in the United States, as you know, when the economy goes south, the president gets blamed, the government gets blamed. Maybe they deserve more or less of the blame, but they will shoulder the blame for that sort of thing. What happens in Brazil when the economy comes to a standstill?"
58131,44,"PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE","Well, we're about to find that out, I think. I mean, there is a bigger picture here. Brazil's been through the largest recession in its history. A massive corruption scandal involving much of the nation's leadership is still playing out. Politicians are generally very unpopular, especially the president, Michel Temer. There's a presidential election in Brazil in just over four months, and no one has a clue who's going to win it. The big question now is, could this dispute snowball and turn into something even bigger and threaten to bring down Temer's government? And if that government falls, what happens next?"
58131,45,"STEVE INSKEEP, HOST","Well, what can the government do about this central complaint of rising fuel prices?"
58131,46,"PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE","Well, last night, Michel Temer went on TV, and he offered a deal that includes cutting diesel prices by the equivalent of 13 cents per liter for a period of 60 days. It's not clear if the truckers will accept this. Brazilians have a practice in which they demonstrate their disapproval by banging pots and pans. And as Temer was speaking on TV last night, the sound of banging pots reverberated around Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo."

She's here with us today at the Newseum, and thanks very much for coming by."
70039,2,ALICIA SHEPARD,Glad to be here.
70039,3,"NEAL CONAN, host",And what do you have for us this week?
70039,4,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Well, this week I have a letter that came from Ken Norton, who's director of a suicide-prevention center in Concord, New Hampshire. And he - I'll just go ahead and read a little bit about it?"
70039,5,"NEAL CONAN, host",Go ahead.
70039,6,ALICIA SHEPARD,"He said - I was - this is a story about the D.C. Madam who, many of you may know, committed suicide last week."
70039,7,"NEAL CONAN, host",Deborah Jean Palfrey was her name.
70039,8,ALICIA SHEPARD,"And it said, ""I was surprised and saddened to hear yesterday's All Things Considered story on the suicide of the D.C. Madam. Research has shown that suicide contagion can occur following inappropriate reporting on suicide deaths."" Then he lists some recommendations on how to report on suicide."
70039,9,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Then he said, ""The ATC story did not follow these recommendations. Not only did this story report how she killed herself, hanging, but went so far as to specify what type of rope she used. While this woman may not be a particularly sympathetic figure, my hope would be that NPR would conduct itself differently than most of our national media and have a policy to ensure their stories follow the guidelines for safe reporting on suicide. Media can play a positive role in preventing suicide. It's all a matter of how it's reported."""
70039,10,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, let's listen to what the complaint was about. This was in an NPR newscast where we played a clip of Tarpon Springs Police Captain Jeffrey Young describing how Deborah Jean Palfrey's mother found the body."
70039,11,_NO_SPEAKER,"(Soundbite of NPR's ""All Things Considered"")"
70039,12,"Police Captain JEFFREY YOUNG (Tarpon Springs, Florida)","When she went outside, she noticed the three-wheel bicycle had been moved that was normally kept in this shed. Upon entering the shed, Blanche Palfrey discovered her daughter, Deborah, had apparently hung herself using a nylon rope from a metal beam on the ceiling of the shed."
70039,13,"NEAL CONAN, host","Again, Tarpon Springs Police Captain Jeffrey Young recording aired on a newscast during All Things Considered on May 1st. Where there is a death, be it suicide, murder, car accident or act of war, how much do you want to know? How much should you know? Our phone number is 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And you can join the conversation on our blog at npr.org/blogofthenation. Lisa Shepard, what did you see as the ethical issue here?"
70039,14,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Well, in all good ethical issues, you have the conflict of whether or not news media should be telling a full picture of what happened. So it's, seek truth. Report it fully. And then the conflicting value in the news media is to minimize harm."
70039,15,ALICIA SHEPARD,"And so the question is, how much detail should there be in this story? Was it too graphic? Should it have led the newscast? It did for - at 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock. And then, each newscast did report it a little differently, but two of them used that quote. And the question is, do we really need to know all that detail?"
70039,16,"NEAL CONAN, host","And I wonder, you took this complaint to NPR senior management, the news management, and how did they respond?"
70039,17,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Well, the - NPR does not have a written policy, and what they do is they use as a guideline to use good sense and what someone called generosity. And what that means is that you don't call something a suicide without actual evidence that it was a suicide. And in that case, NPR followed that because they said it was either an ""apparent"" suicide or they quoted the police official."
70039,18,"NEAL CONAN, host","And the man who wrote the initial complaint, is he right? Does one suicide, or details of one suicide, lead to copycats?"
70039,19,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Well, that is - was his issue. There is some - I asked him today whether or not this was anecdotal, whether there or not there was some real research, and he sent me four of five studies that shows that there is a pattern, when people hear about ways of committing suicide or prominent people who commit suicide, that there can be a spike."
70039,20,"NEAL CONAN, host",And did you find that to be true? At least what those studies suggested it.
70039,21,ALICIA SHEPARD,Those studies suggest that it's true. Now it's in dispute.
70039,22,"NEAL CONAN, host","And at that point, you've got the death of a, well, a public figure."
70039,23,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Right, right. The news media, Neal, typically will report on suicide when two things occur. One, it's a public person, or two, it occurs in a public place. And clearly, Deborah Jean Palfrey was a public person. She had been arrested. She had been through a trial, and the reports said that she was facing up to 55 years in jail, which would lead to why she might have done it. And I think that I had read different things in terms of whether or not that was accurate."
70039,24,"NEAL CONAN, host","We're talking with NPR ombudsman Lisa Shepard. If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Glen is on the line, Glen with us from Columbus, Ohio."
70039,25,GLEN (Caller),"Hi, there's an old comedy routine where there's a referee before a boxing match, and he's telling the two boxers what you're not allowed to do during the boxing match. And he describes this by demonstrating all the things you're not allowed to do on one of the boxers..."
70039,26,"NEAL CONAN, host","No rabbit punches, and he hits him with a rabbit punch."
70039,27,ALICIA SHEPARD,That's what we're doing?
70039,28,GLEN (Caller),"Just your expert there has just told us that it's inappropriate to describe on the air the form of a suicide, and then you begin your broadcast with replaying the tape in question. We got the point. She described what you shouldn't do..."
70039,29,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Well, I think I'd like..."
70039,30,GLEN (Caller),And then you play it again.
70039,31,"NEAL CONAN, host","OK, we get the point, Glen."
70039,32,ALICIA SHEPARD,"We get the point, but I think it's really important to have discussions and to hear from the public and find out, what does the public find offensive? The news media often operate in a vacuum, and I think these kinds of discussions are really important."
70039,33,GLEN (Caller),"I agree, but we've just gone around in a circle and we just - how many more reports do we need describing what you shouldn't do?"
70039,41,ALICIA SHEPARD,You can go to npr.org/ombudsman or contact the ombudsman on a link on npr.org.
70039,42,"NEAL CONAN, host","But this is an issue that goes beyond the suicide, or apparent suicide, of Deborah Jean Palfrey, how much information you put in terms of the way people die. This is an eternally difficult subject. I did a story many years ago after the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco describing, where I asked one of the workers who'd been going in to try to recover the bodies of those that were crushed in the Nimitz Freeway collapse, exactly what it looked like. You know, how bad was it?"
70039,43,"NEAL CONAN, host","And I had to get him to talk about it, I felt, because without information about what happened to those people, without information about how that affected the people who were, the rescue workers, or at this point, recovery workers, I didn't think the story was complete. We got many complaints about this story that it was too graphic."
70039,44,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Yeah. I think that it's a case-by-case decision and in this case, maybe some people found it offensive, that I thought that there was another newscast that simply said that she'd committed suicide, her body was found in the shed, a note was found and that was that. I think that seemed to be enough."
70039,45,ALICIA SHEPARD,"I did speak with the reporter who did this newscast, and he raises a good point, which is it's kind of a slippery slope. If you worry about what you report all the time, should you not report on hijacking, he suggested, because if you give the details on how the hijack occurred that maybe people will hijack planes? Or if you tell about arsonists or people who rob banks, oftentimes the legal - police organizations would prefer that we didn't do that."
70039,46,"NEAL CONAN, host","Let's get another caller on the line and this is Samina (ph), Samina with us - I'm sorry, where are you calling from?"
70039,47,SAMINA (Caller),From Santa Clara.
70039,48,"NEAL CONAN, host","Go ahead, please."
70039,49,SAMINA (Caller),"Yes, in terms of war coverage, although I would prefer not to, you know, hear about the gruesome details, I think it's important for us to know about these details so that the American public would not be so quick to rush to war. You know, I think that we're seeing a very sanitized view, or hearing a very sanitized view, of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan."
70039,50,SAMINA (Caller),"And we don't realize that the indiscriminate bombs that we're dropping are killing and maiming innocent children and women, and you know, and it's devastating people's lives. And I think that if we did know that, the population wouldn't, you know, be so quick, you know, to call for war."
70039,51,"NEAL CONAN, host",Lisa?
70039,52,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Yeah, no, I agree, totally with her. I think they're totally different circumstances. We're talking about one individual, and we're talking about hundreds and thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected by war."
70039,53,"NEAL CONAN, host","Interesting, Samina's point, there were complaints after the attacks on the World Trade Center, for example, pictures of the people who fell from the buildings, obviously very gruesome pictures. I think one of those pictures is here at the Newseum as an example of great journalism."
70039,54,ALICIA SHEPARD,"It actually is, because I wrote a book that the Newseum paid to have written about the coverage of that one day. And we looked at that issue of the picture, and many of you will remember the man falling who maybe had a choice between burning in a building or jumping. And a lot of newspapers did not run that photo. Some of them ran it really big because they felt like it's important to remember. It's important to know what happened. But that was a very historic, traumatic event. This suicide is not."
70039,55,"NEAL CONAN, host","And to get to Samina's point in another way, during the Second World War, there were no images of dead Americans allowed in the newspapers, I think, until the invasion of Tarawa in 1943, and American public, at that point, had not seen dead Americans. And understanding the cost of war and the sacrifice required, well, you don't understand it unless you can see those pictures."
70039,56,ALICIA SHEPARD,"Absolutely, I mean, some of the most iconic photos in our memory are of dead people."
70039,57,"NEAL CONAN, host","Samina, thanks very much for the phone call."
70039,58,SAMINA (Caller),Thank you.
70039,59,"NEAL CONAN, host","We're talking with NPR ombudsman Lisa Shepard, who's with us here at the Newseum. If you'd like to join the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. And this is Talk of the Nation from NPR news. Here's an email along the same point that Samina was talking about, from Steele (ph) in Neenah, Wisconsin. ""Too bad detail is gone. People seem more disconnected to violence, i.e. video games, TV shows, yet reality seems taboo."""
70039,60,ALICIA SHEPARD,"I think that's a good point. Again, I think you need to differentiate between the circumstances. Violent details, as I've often thought as a journalist, can drive a story. They can put you there. They can show you exactly what happened, make you feel something. So I think they are very important but in each case, you have to make different decisions."
70039,61,"NEAL CONAN, host","At some point, it becomes - well, how do you know when to draw the line? When does it become gratuitous? When did this become just prurient?"
70039,62,ALICIA SHEPARD,"I think that will also depend on who's listening, because I was thinking with this, that particular quote that we aired awhile ago, the issue was, you know, whether or not it should have been aired and then also, whether or not it was just plain offensive to hear. Do you really need to hear him say that her mother went in there and found her? I just feel like you can almost know what that was like without using any descriptive details."
70039,63,"NEAL CONAN, host",Let's get a...
70039,64,ALICIA SHEPARD,I think we could all imagine that.
70039,65,"NEAL CONAN, host","Belle is with us, Belle calling from Truckee in California. Hello?"
70039,66,BELLE (Caller),Hello.
70039,67,"NEAL CONAN, host",Go ahead. You're on the air.
70039,68,BELLE (Caller),"In terms of censorship and how we try to make everything so whitewashed, I spend a lot of time in Mexico, and on the front page of their newspapers, they will have graphic, gory pictures of car accidents or gang violence or whatever it may be. Maybe over the years you get used to it. But to me, I think if I saw more pictures of horrible SUV crashes, people might pay a little more attention to the way they drive. If they saw the consequences of their actions, they might pay a little more attention sometimes..."
70039,69,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yeah, and car fatalities, I think, an underreported story."
70039,70,ALICIA SHEPARD,I think there's nothing more - stronger than a single photo to sometimes just really affect you.
80598,1,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",What you're about to hear is a pitch for a political movement.
70039,71,"NEAL CONAN, host","Then there is - thanks very much for the call, Belle. But then there's the other extreme that people complain about. When you see local TV news, for example, and in many places across the country, the if-it-bleeds-it-leads, blood-on-the-sidewalk stories, that sort of thing, which people say, look, this vastly over-represents the threat of violent crime in our communities. It makes people scared to go out of their houses at night."
70039,72,ALICIA SHEPARD,"And then you could argue, on the other hand, that if you don't put in a lot of the details and gory details, then you're just whitewashing it, and you're making it so bland that people wouldn't be interested."
70039,73,ALICIA SHEPARD,"And that's what's interesting about ethical issues is there's never really a clear, black-and-white answer. There are always different, competing values that have to be weighed, and that's why it's always on a case-by-case. While NPR has a general policy about using good sense, I think that's really all you need."
70039,74,"NEAL CONAN, host","Jeremy's on the line from Utica, New York."
70039,75,JEREMY(Caller),"Hi, Neal. Good afternoon."
70039,76,"NEAL CONAN, host",Afternoon.
70039,77,JEREMY(Caller),"I'm calling because real recently, an incident such as this affected myself and my family. I understand I need to keep it brief so I'll do just that. My cousin went missing New Year's Day. There was a large-scale search-and-rescue operation. The premise of the operation was that we were out searching for my cousin who had gone hunting, as per a note he had left."
70039,78,JEREMY(Caller),"The real and true outcome of that, I guess, isn't really important in the large-scale of things in life, but the way our local media portrayed it, well, reported on it, just recently, here within the last week, his body was found and the medical coroner's - medical examiner's report and the New York State Police report, nowhere in it listed the word suicide. The way the outcome has been listed was exactly this, and it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest."
70039,79,ALICIA SHEPARD,And how did the news media report it?
70039,80,JEREMY(Caller),"Well, they reported it initially online at 2:31 p.m. last Thursday as, ""The Missing Hunter Committed Suicide,"" and then goes on to essentially paraphrase the medical examiner's report in their first lines of the release. It did not have quotes around the word suicide, but then two lines later (unintelligible) dispatch had placed in there the medical examiner's name and the cause of death in quotations, which was ""self-inflected gunshot wound to the chest."""
70039,81,"NEAL CONAN, host","And of course, a self-inflicted gunshot wound can be an accident, too."
70039,82,JEREMY(Caller),"Well, thank you, Neal, and I am a hunter myself. I'm an outdoorsman. I'm also a former law-enforcement officer in the military. And I spent many days away from work in January with my cousin's sons and daughter and family, and the countless hours that were selflessly given by the New York State Police, the forest rangers, the D.E.C. officers, anybody that would go a search-and-rescue operation, let alone the out-of-state people that came on their own time."
70039,83,JEREMY(Caller),"You know, I just don't think that their reporting that matter did anything but sensationalize the outcome of that, and unfortunately, it brought no intrinsic value to, in my opinion, to those, essentially, couple hundred searchers..."
70039,84,"NEAL CONAN, host","Jeremy, I'm afraid we're out of time. But thank you for the call...."
70039,85,JEREMY(Caller),But I think it's important to keep in mind...
70039,86,"NEAL CONAN, host","I understand. Be very careful about that ""apparent"" suicide or ""self-inflicted gunshot wound."""
70039,87,ALICIA SHEPARD,"I think he's also talking about just the family. I mean, you think about all the people that are affected."

72046,1,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host",Back now with DAY TO DAY.  I'm Ferai Chideya.
72046,2,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host","New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer is at it again.  Known for his      aggressive investigations, Spitzer has turned his attention to digital      music. He's reviewing whether big music studios are price fixing what      goes into your digital music player.  ""Marketplace's"" Janet Babin is here      to talk about this latest action."
72046,3,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host","Welcome, Janet, and what is Spitzer investigating?"
72046,5,JANET BABIN reporting,"Hi, Ferai."
72046,6,JANET BABIN reporting,"Attorney General Spitzer is looking into whether the big four music      studios that pretty much lead the industry have colluded to set the price      of songs downloaded off the Internet.  And those companies include Warner      Music, Sony BMG, Vivendi Universal and EMI.  Now Warner said it received      a subpoena last week and The Wall Street Journal reports that BMG and      Universal have also gotten subpoenas."
72046,7,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host",So how much does it cost to download music these days?
72046,8,BABIN,"Well, there was once a time when it was free, of course.  But now      if you browse to Apple Computer's iTune site, you'll pay about 99 cents a      download.  Wholesale, though, is a different story.  The LA Times reports      that digital music costs anywhere from 60 to 90 cents a song, and there      are still, of course, people who manage somehow--don't ask me how--to      actually avoid paying for downloaded music.  And there are freebies, too,      from band Web sites.  They often offer their unreleased songs for free on      their Web sites."
72046,9,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host","So Janet, you have a situation where some people are      downloading music for free, some people are going to places like the      iTunes store and paying for it.  What is this doing to the recording      industry overall.  CD sales are flat, is that correct?"
72046,10,BABIN,"Right.  CD sales don't look so good and some in the industry say      that music downloads were just starting to make them some money.  So the      Spitzer investigation comes at a real inopportune moment for them.      Nielsen SoundScan says that more than three million tracks were sold      online this year, and that compares to last year with 127 million tracks      sold."
72046,11,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host",So the recording industry says that downloaded song should cost      more.  Is that correct?
72046,12,BABIN,"Right.  The recording industry wants these songs to cost more,      and they're complaining about Apple's song pricing.  They want to get      Apple to either raise the price for downloads or to vary the costs.  So a      song from, say, Kanye West would cost more than an older song from Mariah      Carey."
72046,13,"FERAI CHIDEYA, host","So sort of like a bargain-bin approach?  Some bands would be      bargain-bin bands, and some bands would be full-price bands?"
72046,14,BABIN,Exactly.

68420,2,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Republicans hoping to take back control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections have a lot riding on the Tea Party. Across the country, conservative Republican candidates with strong Tea Party support are challenging incumbent Democrats. We have reports now on three races: the first from NPR's Greg Allen on a tight contest in Florida."
68420,3,GREG ALLEN,"The battle is between Democratic incumbent Ron Klein and his Tea Party-backed challenger, Republican Allen West. They're facing off in a congressional district that includes Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach and is home to many retirees and affluent voters. It might seem improbable then that this district has produced West, who's turned out to be one of the election season's more fiery candidates."
68420,4,"Mr. ALLEN WEST (Republican Congressional Candidate, Florida)","We need to meet in places and start talking about restoring our liberty and fighting back against a tyrannical government. It starts right here, it starts right now with each one of you that's gathered here today."
68420,5,GREG ALLEN,"That speech, given about a year ago, has received more than two million views on YouTube. It helped West raise more than $4 million in his attempt to unseat Democrat Ron Klein. West, an African-American, is a former Army lieutenant colonel. He was forced to retire after an incident in Iraq in which he fired a gun near a detainee's head, an effort, he said, to get information about a possible ambush. His supporters see that as just another sign that West is willing to take tough action when necessary."
68420,6,GREG ALLEN,"This is West's second time challenging Klein. Two years ago, with little money or outside support, he drew 45 percent of the vote. This time he has money, an anti-incumbent tide, and a Tea Party surge in his favor. Klein has run ads attacking West as an extremist and a person who preaches personal responsibility but who doesn't live up to his words."
68420,7,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of ad)
68420,8,Unidentified Man,"The IRS filed an $11,000 lien against West for back taxes. Three liens were placed on his home for unpaid bills. And a judge ordered West to pay over $5,000 in past-due credit card bills. Allen West, the wrong values for South Florida."
68420,9,GREG ALLEN,"West says the IRS lien was a mistake, and as for the other unpaid bills, he says they accumulated while he was in Afghanistan."
68420,10,"Mr. ALLEN WEST (Republican Congressional Candidate, Florida)","So if he wants to attack my wife, who was back here trying to maintain a household with our two daughters while I was over protecting him, that's where I have a problem with him."
68420,11,GREG ALLEN,"Klein is a moderate Democrat, an ardent supporter of Israel and a proponent of President Obama's health care overhaul and stimulus package - both of which he voted for. In a recent debate, he told West that his vow to stick to his guns and reject working with the other party won't fly in Congress."
68420,12,"Representative RON KLEIN (Democrat, Florida)","The bottom line is, what are you positions? And if it's about divisiveness (unintelligible) my opponent's comments at some point where I don't believe in inclusiveness, I don't believe in working with other people. That's ridiculous. That kind of behavior will not create one job."
68420,13,GREG ALLEN,"Polls show it's a tight race, but Democrats are throwing everything they have at it, including President Obama, who was here this week for a Ron Klein fundraiser."

It's about an hour from Boston. The buildings and dorms are large blocks of ribbed concrete in a style of architecture known as brutalism. This week, students were still walking around campus, sunbathing and reading in the library."
60226,4,JOSHUA ENCARNACION,"What you really feel is a sense of affinity; family, pride, because everyone's just come to care for each other."
60226,5,"ANNE MOSTUE, BYLINE",Joshua Encarnacion is finishing his junior year. He is president of his class.
60226,6,JOSHUA ENCARNACION,"I feel like all of the media attention focuses on what people see from outside in. Because on campus, the first day back we were right back to work. It feels like no one missed an assignment, no professor was late on work. And so everybody was ready to begin finals week when it all happened."
60226,7,"ANNE MOSTUE, BYLINE","What happened was the arrest of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old Boston Marathon bombing suspect. He lived in a dorm on campus and the school was evacuated for a day. Classmates have since told police and the media that he played intramural soccer, smoked marijuana and was a mediocre student. Police and the FBI eventually arrested three of his friends, only one of whom was still enrolled at the school. Officials say the friends had no knowledge of the bombings beforehand but they're charged with destroying evidence and misleading police. At first, the school administration had no comment. It has since announced plans to review its handling of several issues. And Chancellor Divina Grossman says the arrests do not represent the campus of 9,500 students."
60226,8,DIVINA GROSSMAN,"This is a beacon of hope and educational opportunity in this region. The men and women who worked in the textile mills and the fishing industry, they had bright hopes and aspirations for their children."
60226,9,"ANNE MOSTUE, BYLINE",Chancellor Grossman herself first came to the school as a foreign student from the Philippines.
60226,10,DIVINA GROSSMAN,"So, when you look at UMass Dartmouth, the real story about it is how it transforms lives of individual students and how for many of our students it's the first time somebody in their family is going to college and completing college."
60226,11,"ANNE MOSTUE, BYLINE","Grossman says UMass Dartmouth didn't turn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev into a terrorist, just as Harvard didn't turn Ted Kaczynski into a Unabomber. And at a school where about half the students live off-campus, it's difficult to keep track of what they do in their free time. Senior Leanne Poirier has been reporting on the arrests for the school paper. She says it's strange, and somewhat frustrating, for her school to be associated with alleged terrorist activity."
60226,12,LEANNE POIRIER,"People are kind of joking now, like, oh my gosh, like, UMass is breeding terrorists. But I don't think that's the case at all. I just think that it's a low-cost school, it's a state school and, you know, some people ended up being here at the wrong time for all of us, I guess."
60226,13,"ANNE MOSTUE, BYLINE","Still, in response to the arrests, UMass Dartmouth is boosting security and limiting the number of people who may attend graduation. For NPR News, I'm Anne Mostue."
60873,1,"NOEL KING, HOST","Good morning. I'm Noel King. A California man has set out to prove that the Earth is flat. Mike Hughes wants to launch himself into space in a home-built rocket to get a look. He worked on the rocket for two years. And this weekend, he made it to - not space exactly. He got a third of a mile into the air then fell back to Earth. The rocket had a parachute, but Hughes got a little banged up. He told a reporter he had a sore back and just wanted to get home, have dinner and see his cats. It's MORNING EDITION."
65791,1,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","Everywhere we go, we are carrying around little tracking devices. You know this. It's our cell phones. Wireless providers keep records of where we have been, and those records, as you can imagine, are of great interest to law enforcement. But here's a question. Does the government need a warrant to look at cellphone location data? That is a question in front of the Supreme Court this morning, and here's more from NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg."
65791,2,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE","The irony of today's case is that it involves massive cellphone thefts, a string of armed robberies at RadioShacks in Michigan and Ohio. The robbers entered the stores, guns drawn, herded patrons to the back, loaded up laundry bags with new smartphones and then later sold their booty for tens of thousands of dollars per haul. In April of 2011, police arrested four men, one of whom confessed that he and a shifting group of 15 others had robbed nine different stores over the previous year. The suspect identified Timothy Carpenter as one of the ringleaders. The thieves all pleaded guilty except for Carpenter and his half brother. At their trial, the icing on the prosecution case was the cellphone location information recorded by Carpenter's wireless provider for each of the calls he placed or received on the dates of the robberies."
65791,3,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE","Now, remember, this was seven years ago and several smartphone generations. The information used at Carpenter's trial was not exactly precise. It did not record where he was when he texted or where he was when his phone was not in use, but when he made or received calls, the cellphone towers nearby recorded his general location with an accuracy range of about a half mile to two miles. And guess what? Those calls matched up rather nicely with the vicinity of the robberies. While there was eyewitness and video evidence against Carpenter, too, his lawyer Harold Gurwitz said the painfully irrefutable evidence was the cellphone data."
65791,4,HAROLD GURWITZ,It's the kind of evidence that in the end is the most difficult to argue to a jury that they shouldn't credit because the records are what they are.
65791,5,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE","The question before the Supreme Court is whether the cops should have gotten a search warrant in order to obtain the cell location information. That would have required them to show a judge that they had probable cause to believe those records contained evidence of a crime. What they did instead was obtain a court order under the federal Stored Communications Act, which is easier. In this case, as in others, prosecutors argue that the Supreme Court has long viewed information shared by a consumer as fair game without a warrant. Even before the stored records law was enacted, the high court ruled that you lose your Fourth Amendment right to privacy when you share information with a third party like the phone company. Fourth Amendment scholar Orin Kerr contends that the idea of tracking someone's movements in public is not new. The police, for instance, tail a suspect or check on his alibi. Only when they search the suspect's home or person do they have to get a court-approved warrant. As to the general cell location data at issue in this case, he maintains..."
65791,6,ORIN KERR,These records are basically the network equivalent of public observation that traditionally would not be protected.

74806,1,"NEAL CONAN, host",This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.
74806,2,"NEAL CONAN, host","In the summer of 2002, Kevin Davis sat down in the Cook County criminal courts building in Chicago and listened to a woman's dispassionate description of the precise manner in which she killed her baby daughter and disposed of the body. Startled by the horrific story, Davis wondered how anybody could possibly defend this woman, and he spent the next five years finding out."
74806,3,"NEAL CONAN, host","He shadowed public defenders in Chicago and particular the elite murder task force, the public defenders who represent people accused of monstrous crimes with a deck(ph) and usually the evidence stacked against them. In his new book ""Defending the Damned,"" he focuses on a formidable public defender named Marijane Placek and the case of Aloysius Oliver, a convicted felon accused of murdering a Chicago police officer."
74806,4,"NEAL CONAN, host","Later on in the program, the political junkie Ken Rudin joins us. If you have questions about Michael Bloomberg as a potential third party candidate, about Hillary Clinton's turn as Tony Soprano or other news of the week in electoral politics, send us an e-mail now, talk@npr.org.

You can also join the conversation on out blog, npr.org/blogofthenation."
74806,5,"NEAL CONAN, host",Kevin Davis joins us from our bureau in Chicago. Nice to have you on the program today.
74806,6,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Thank you very much, Neal."
74806,7,"NEAL CONAN, host","So tell us, after you got to know some members of that public defender's murder task force, what did you - what did they tell you when you asked what I gather, they called the cocktail party question, why do you defend these terrible people?"
74806,8,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","You know, the simple answer is, everybody deserves a defense, and it's our constitutional right. But I think it goes far beyond that because these public defenders, everyday that they're in court, are really acting as watchdogs in our criminal justice system. A lot of them have a very high sense of competition, compassion. Some of them are do-gooders as - but really, their motivations are as different as they are. So there's not really one answer to the cocktail party question. So I really spent all that time trying to watch them and let their words and actions in court offer that insight."
74806,9,"NEAL CONAN, host","Here's a quote from the book, ""anybody who chooses this work has to be fearless and unconcerned with whether anyone likes them. It's not a job for those seeking approval. It's a job for those willing to rattle cages, make enemies and raise hell."""
74806,10,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Absolutely. And that's what impressed me most about these public defenders, because everyday that they go into court, they are challenging authority. They are cross-examining police officers. They are basically in a very unpopular position. And it takes a lot of guts to do that, and that's what they do everyday."
74806,11,"NEAL CONAN, host","Explain the unpopular position. Put it in the context of the Aloysius Oliver trial, and explain just how difficult it is to overcome that."
74806,12,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Well, Aloysius Oliver was charged with killing Chicago police officer Eric Lee in 2001. And I chose this case because I really believed it symbolized the classic battle between good and evil. Here you had an ex-convict, an alleged street thug, charged with killing a symbol of law and order, a Chicago police officer. And interestingly, both Aloysius Oliver and Eric Lee grew up in the same impoverished neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, and their lives took really divergent paths."
74806,13,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","But when you are defending an accused cop-killer that really is the kind of case that brings out a lot of public outrage. Everyday in that courtroom during the trial, it was filled with police officers. Everyday that Marijane Placek and her co-counsel Ruth McBeth went into court, they can feel the sting of those eyes looking at them. They could feel just the ill will of the family towards them. They did not walk in that courtroom popular people."
74806,14,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yet, when she thought she might get the case, Marijane Placek said, the challenge is why I want it. It's going to be fun."
74806,15,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Yes. I was really struck by that. And she's not the only one who said that. A lot of public defenders said their job is fun. Now, you know, that's not disrespectful to victims of crimes or their families. They love their profession because they see what they're doing is having a higher calling. They really, truly believe that they're defending the Constitution and the laws of our land, and also that they look at this as a game, as a battle, as a joust. You know, everyday that they're in court challenging the prosecutors, it's fun for them. And they do enjoy it."
74806,16,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yet it was interesting. Marijane Placek, the lawyer you write most about, maintains emotional distance from her clients. And you point out in your book, you went and met with the members of the slain officer's family. She didn't do that."
74806,17,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",No…
74806,18,"NEAL CONAN, host","You know, that it's - she needs to maintain that emotional distance."
74806,50,JOHN (Caller),"I'm a ex-prosecutor and an ex - and do defense work today. And I, you know, my comment is that, I don't think it's black and white, and I don't think that you can, when you're doing the work that we do, you can't put it in the context of - and it definitely isn't that you have no compassion for a victim, because, well, in a sense, your clients are victims too. In the big picture, you end up liking most of the people you represent, a great majority of them."
80598,4,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","It's from a hip-hop artist who says he feels like he has been given a false choice. Sho Baraka was raised by a Black Panther. He is passionate about fixing poverty and reforming the police, and he feels Democrats are more compassionate on those issues. And yet, as an evangelical Christian, Baraka has a big problem with that party. He opposes abortion rights, and on social issues, he is more closely aligned with Republicans. The AND campaign is this rapper's attempt to forge a new path among a group he reluctantly labels urban Christians. And for inspiration, Sho Baraka has said this movement might look at the tea party, a group many see as dividing Republicans in recent years."
80598,5,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",Defend the tea party as a successful movement and model in your mind that you would love to copy.
80598,6,SHO BARAKA,"Well, no, I (laughter) I don't know if I'm going to defend them as successful. But I will say they've been successful in communicating their desire and their needs in the sense of creating a platform where people hear their desires and what they stand for. And I don't know if there is a unified voice in the urban Christian context where you can say that there is these group of peoples who speak for us. And I do feel like the tea party has been successful in doing that."
80598,7,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",What's your ultimate goal here?
80598,8,SHO BARAKA,"Ultimately, I think baby steps. One, just creating a coalition that is biblically based but also shares the compassion that Jesus displayed in the Scriptures, an individual who cares for the poor, who's concerned for the outcast and the marginalized but, at the same time, doesn't compromise his divinity in order to show compassion. I think what we often are asked to do is to make those things mutually exclusive."
80598,9,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",Are you going to vote in November?
80598,10,SHO BARAKA,I am going to vote. I'm especially going to vote in my state and local elections. I will definitely cast a ballot for someone in a presidential election. It will not be Trump or Clinton.
80598,11,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","Do you worry that by voting for a candidate who's not a Republican, not a Democrat, that you're not really taking part in the election?"
80598,12,SHO BARAKA,"I mean, I understand the argument and I think it's a viable argument, but I also believe the protest vote, as they will say, it should speak volumes. So, like, if Donald Trump wins, then the Democratic Party should recognize, well, there is a base of individuals that we could have actually listened to and rather pandered to. And then on the left, if Hillary Clinton wins, I think there needs to be a lot of work done on the right to say, hey, how do we actually - like, you know, you hear a lot of Donald Trump in his platitudes of I'll help the black community. But what actually will you do?"
80598,13,SHO BARAKA,"And I don't think there's been any steps to actually have real, legitimate conversations or interactions with people. And so for both parties, I think there needs to be a reassessment on how we are to earn the vote of the urban Christian."
80598,14,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",You're a musician. I guess I wonder if there's a song of yours that you feel speaks to the kinds of tension that we've been talking about.
80598,15,SHO BARAKA,"Absolutely. It's a song called ""Maybe Both."""
80598,16,_NO_SPEAKER,"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MAYBE BOTH"")"
80598,17,SHO BARAKA,(Rapping) Is it a ballot or a bullet. Let me know. Should I fight or should I pray? Who's my foe? Are they killing with a pistol or a vote? Or maybe it is both.
80598,18,SHO BARAKA,"It's loosely based off of Malcolm X's Ballot in a Bullet speech where he talks about the importance of the vote and to hold your vote and use it like a bullet. You don't waste bullets in war. And I think what we've done, not just as an urban Christian demographic but as a black community, I think we've just given our allegiance - blind allegiance to the Democratic Party without them actually giving any real true concern to the plight of African-Americans in this country."
80598,19,_NO_SPEAKER,"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MAYBE BOTH"")"
80598,20,SHO BARAKA,"(Rapping) Put your ballot in the air. Pull out a lighter, then burn it. We just give away votes. Make them Democrats earn it."
80598,21,SHO BARAKA,"Malcolm X would have said that was political. He called those individuals political chumps. And so this song basically talks about a critique of both parties. And then on the third verse, I draw a greater conclusion on how oftentimes we use Jesus as a construct to propel or promote our own personal agendas. But understand that he was much more complex than we often like to make him out to be."
80598,22,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","Sho Baraka, it's been a real pleasure. Thank you."
80598,23,SHO BARAKA,"Thank you, David. I appreciate it. It's been a pleasure."
80598,24,"DAVID GREENE, HOST",Sho Baraka is a recording artist and also co-founder of the AND campaign.
90087,1,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","To begin to understand the cycle of war and suffering in one part of Africa, it is worth meeting one man. His name is Daniel Majook Gai. As a boy, he fled the civil war in Sudan, running miles by himself to safety, leaving his family behind. He was one of the so-called lost boys of that conflict. After years in refugee camps, he landed in the United States. He reunited with his family, got an education and in 2011, returned home to what was now an independent country - South Sudan. But war came back and split that new nation. Daniel was forced to flee again, this time as a young man with a wife, infant son and elderly father."

90087,4,"DAVID GREENE, HOST","That was Daniel when we reached him back in January. A year later, South Sudan is still in a civil war between factions supported by the president and his former vice president. The United States supported South Sudan's independence and thought this young country would be a rare success story in East Africa. But the violence just won't stop. As we close out 2014, we wanted to revisit Daniel, one of the more memorable people we met this year. We reached him in Nairobi, Kenya."

Rather, wireless providers keep the data recorded by cell towers in order to monitor and improve their service. Challenging that argument in the Supreme Court today will be the ACLU's Nathan Freed Wessler."
65791,8,NATHAN FREED WESSLER,This kind of cellphone technology really changes the game and threatens to upend our expectations of privacy in the digital age.
65791,9,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE",This wasn't a case of the police following a shady person he observes.
65791,10,NATHAN FREED WESSLER,They decided after the fact they wanted to try to tie him to a crime. And never before has the government had the power to press rewind on someone's life and chart out a record of where they were going over the course of four months.
65791,11,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE","Over the course of four months and nearly 13,000 calls. The mere fact that the phone data used to convict Carpenter was held by his service provider doesn't change the equation, Wessler maintains. Indeed, he knows that tracking a smartphone gets more and more precise by the day, in some cases allowing law enforcement to pinpoint the building or the office a suspect is in. Professor Kerr counters that the path between the government's law enforcement power and privacy rights is not a one-way street."
65791,12,ORIN KERR,"This is a technology that can be used to facilitate crime and also can be used by the government to help solve the crime, and those two, I think, roughly balance each other out."
65791,13,"NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE","Indeed, he notes, that with private service providers increasingly encrypting data content, it may soon be impossible for law enforcement to obtain the contents of calls and texts even with a search warrant. And with encrypting on the rise, Kerr says, it could well be that the only data the government will have ready access to will be records like those at issue in this case, cellphone site records, or automatic license plate reader records or video from public surveillance cameras. The Supreme Court has in recent years laid down some new rules for the digital age. If the police use a GPS tracking device to monitor a person's life over a long term, they do need a search warrant. And if they seize a smartphone at the time of an arrest, in order to view its contents, they need a warrant for that, too. So today's case is just the latest battle in what promises to be a long technological and legal war. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington."
67193,1,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Sometimes, news flashes by so quickly we don't recognize real history. Rahm Emanuel was elected mayor of Chicago Tuesday. Any name that isn't Daley in that office ranks as history, though with Bill Daley becoming White House chief of staff just as his brother, Richard M. Daley, leaves City Hall, the Daley name will stay at least as prominent in the news as Charlie Sheen's."
67193,2,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Rahm Emanuel, of course, was the White House chief of staff who preceded Bill Daley. He's also a former Democratic operative and Illinois congressman who is famed and more than a little feared for both his temper and wit. He won 40 of Chicago's 50 wards."
67193,3,"SCOTT SIMON, host","But as the dust and clutter of a tough campaign settles, the most remarkable feature of this election may be that the vote did not break down along ethnic lines. The U.S. Census puts the white population of Chicago at about 40 percent, African-Americans at 33 percent, and Hispanics of varying races and national origins at 27 percent and growing."
67193,4,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Mr. Emanuel won about 54 percent of the vote. Gery Chico, a former Chicago school board chief, and who has Mexican heritage, won about 25 percent. Carol Mosley Braun, who was the first black woman in the US Senate and was endorsed for mayor by a coalition of African-American leaders, won just 9 percent, as did Miguel del Valle, the City Clerk, who was born in Puerto Rico."
67193,5,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Clearly, a lot of African-Americans and Hispanics voted for Rahm Emanuel. And if you take a look at the results from north side wards, where many Jewish voters live, a good number of Jews voted for Gery Chico, even though Mr. Emanuel will be Chicago's first Jewish mayor - and that's also a bit of history. When I was growing up in Chicago, there were still apartment buildings - they were called restricted - that kept out Jews."
67193,6,"SCOTT SIMON, host","I spoke to an accomplished Chicago ward pol this week who found all of this amazing. We've usually kept score ethnically here, he said. We'd say things like: The Poles will vote this way, the Mexicans will vote that way, Lithuanians won't vote for a black, blacks won't vote for a Jew, and Puerto Ricans won't vote for a Cuban. But now, everyone's up for grabs. You can't label anyone."
67193,7,"SCOTT SIMON, host","Rahm Emanuel had a few incomparable advantages, including an enormous campaign fund, fattened by celebrity admirers, and his association with President Obama, whose own election two years ago might help us see what happened in his hometown this week.

Now, not all public defenders feel the same way that she does. But that is not to say that you can't have compassion for a victim of a crime or a victim's family.

If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255. E-mail - talk@npr.org. And let's begin with Jonathan(ph). Jonathan is calling us from Aspen, Colorado."
74806,23,JONATHAN (Caller),"Yes. Hi, how are you?"
74806,24,"NEAL CONAN, host",I'm well. Thanks.
74806,25,JONATHAN (Caller),"Yeah. I was a public defender in Chicago for eight years in the '90s and then subsequently moved out here. And now, I run a legal aide agency that primarily serves victims."
74806,26,"NEAL CONAN, host",And why did you leave Chicago and the Public Defender's Office?
74806,27,JONATHAN (Caller),"Part of it was just I really preferred to be in the mountains, but part of it was also a manifestation of just ultimate burnout. I said when my burnout would reach four digits then I would want to move on and do something else."
74806,28,"NEAL CONAN, host",And what told you it had gone past three digits?
74806,29,JONATHAN (Caller),I don't think there was any precise case. But it's certainly a challenging work. It's a rewarding work. But it certainly wears on you to see the tragedy of human society…
74806,30,"NEAL CONAN, host",Yeah.
74806,31,JONATHAN (Caller),…over and over again every day.
74806,32,"NEAL CONAN, host",Did you keep track of your batting average?
74806,33,JONATHAN (Caller),"No, I think that what we kept on doing is redefining what the batting average was. So it wasn't a matter of how many cases you've won or lost, but whether or not your client was treated fairly compared to what the facts(ph) were against them."
74806,34,"NEAL CONAN, host",Which suggest you didn't win very often?
74806,35,JONATHAN (Caller),"I would say in the Public Defender's Office, my win or loss record probably was less than in private practice. And part of that was the ability to select cases and also part of it…"
74806,36,"NEAL CONAN, host",Sure.
74806,37,JONATHAN (Caller),…is just the overwhelming caseload the public defenders have.
74806,38,"NEAL CONAN, host","And now, representing primarily victims, you see the other side?"
74806,39,JONATHAN (Caller),"I think I see both sides. I don't think my perspective has changed. I saw myself as public defender, part of what our role was to make sure the system worked, to try to make sure. In fact, I have friends who were officers even when I was a defense attorney who kind of saw that what our role was wasn't to get people off as much as to make sure that they did a good job, and if they did it right, there would be a conviction. And if they did it wrong, the client wouldn't be convicted."
74806,40,"NEAL CONAN, host","Jonathan, thanks very much. It's interesting."
74806,41,JONATHAN (Caller),Sure. Bye-bye.
74806,42,"NEAL CONAN, host","Appreciate it. And Kevin Davis, it's interesting. You also, at the end of your book, go back and talked to several of the people you talked to during the book, who have since decided to leave the Chicago Public Defender's Office as well."
74806,43,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Yes. And those were members of the murder task force. And what happened to some of these lawyers is, just as the caller said, you do get burned out, particularly in a murder task force, because you are representing potential death penalty cases. And all of them told me that the responsibility, the immense responsibility that they felt when their clients' lives were literally in their hands was often just too much to take, day after day, year after year. There was one lawyer in particular, Todd Musburger, who had to defend a client accused of an awful crime, who - it was a woman, a pregnant or a woman on her way to a lamas class. And she was kidnapped and held in the trunk and murdered. And…"
74806,44,"NEAL CONAN, host",Linda Goldstone?
74806,45,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Linda Goldstone. The defendant was named Hernando Williams. It was one of the first cases, death penalty cases that came back after it was brought back here in Illinois. Todd gave this his all. And his closing argument, which was around the time of the holidays, was just so impassioned and had taken so much out of him that he just felt he gave it his all. And the jury came back in less than an hour and voted to kill Hernando Williams. And Todd Musburger knew at that point that he just could not do that any longer."
74806,46,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Because he felt as horrific is the crime was that Hernando Williams was convicted of, that he was a human being. And Todd sat next to him. He felt his breath. He felt the blood pulsing through his veins. He knew that this was a real human being. And he may not had been able to be as this passionate as some of the other public defenders are, because he felt a very personal stake in what he was doing. And just left the office after that."
74806,47,"NEAL CONAN, host","Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is John(ph). John with us in Portsmouth, New Hampshire."
74806,48,JOHN (Caller),Hi.
74806,49,"NEAL CONAN, host",Hi. Go ahead please.
74806,78,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",Hi.
74806,142,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yeah. Kevin Davis, you point out they're obviously unpopular with the cops sometimes, certainly with prosecutors and with victims sometimes, but even their own clients don't like public defenders."
74806,51,JOHN (Caller),"They may make bad decisions, they may deserve to go to jail for a time, but they don't necessarily deserve to be judged for life as evil or good, because that's not the context in which human nature survive. It doesn't - it's just not real life. But I think the press wants to make it bad, and I think our society wants to make it bad, because we want to hate the person that did the crime."
74806,52,"NEAL CONAN, host","Interesting. Going back to the case you write so much about Kevin Davis, the public defender of Marijane Placek, starts out not liking her client very much and actually doming to change her mind so much."
74806,53,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","She did. And Aloysius Oliver was not typical in some ways, because he actually had a chance to go to college. He was somebody who did well in school. But - and I did interview Oliver later on. And he admitted to me that the pulse of the street and so-called thug life were stronger than the pulse of going to college and getting an education. He was smart. He read - while he was in jail awaiting his trial - sophisticated books, all sorts, fiction and non-fiction. And I think what did frustrate Marijane about that was, here was a guy who had some brains and made some really bad choices."
74806,54,"NEAL CONAN, host","Sound familiar, John."
74806,55,JOHN (Caller),It does.
74806,56,"NEAL CONAN, host",Yeah.
74806,57,JOHN (Caller),Thank you very much.
74806,58,"NEAL CONAN, host",Thanks very much for the call.
74806,59,"NEAL CONAN, host","We're going to take more of your calls with Kevin Davis about his book, ""Defending the Damned."" We'll talk more about what these public defenders do and why they do it, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Email us - talk@npr.org. I'm Neal Conan. This is the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."
74806,60,_NO_SPEAKER,(Soundbite of music)
74806,61,"NEAL CONAN, host","This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Ken Rudin, our political junkie, weighs in a bit later. If you have questions about this week in politics, and this question swirling around New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, will he or won't he? E-mail us, talk@npr.org."
74806,62,"NEAL CONAN, host","Right now, Kevin Davis is with us. He spent five years following an elite group of public defenders in Chicago's Cook County, trying to find out why they defend some of the worst criminals in the system. What he learned is the subject of his new book, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defender's Office."""
74806,63,"NEAL CONAN, host","You can read about the huge odds stacked up against public defenders in an excerpt we've posted online. That's at npr.org/talk. If you have an experience as a public defender or as one of their clients or as one of their opponents, perhaps, give us a call, 800-989-8255, e-mail is talk@npr.org. And you can also read whatever listeners have to say at our blog, npr.org/blogofthenation."
74806,64,"NEAL CONAN, host","And Kevin Davis, I have to say, you focused entirely on the city of Chicago, in Cook County there, where despite some difficulties, and I know they're having problems right now with budget cutbacks, this is a well-funded, well-paying jobs."
74806,65,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Absolutely. And public defenders who stay on and get 10 plus years experience or become supervisors can make over $100,000 a year. It certainly may not match with some of their - colleagues in private practice make, they do start out smaller. But it is a well-paying job."
74806,66,"NEAL CONAN, host","And that contrast sharply with the situation in a lot of other counties and states around the country where public defenders are, well, even more overwhelmed that they are in Chicago. And make much less money."
74806,67,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Yes, absolutely. Now, they very well may have good salaries. But as you mentioned, there have been cutbacks in the Cook County Public Defender's Office. They just lost 13 lawyers, and - but also, the state's attorney office has lost prosecutors. Funding of our criminal justice seems to be on the wane."
74806,68,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","There was just an article in the National Law Journal that said public defenders' offices across the country are strained beyond capacity. And as far as 2000, the U.S. Justice Department said public defense in the United States is in a chronic state of crisis. So this is nothing really new but it seems to be getting worse. And the strain on these public defenders and the caseloads means that clients are not going to be represented adequately."
74806,69,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","New Orleans was an extreme example. A few months ago was so underfunded there were hundreds of clients in jail who had never seen their attorneys. And a criminal court judge suspended the prosecution of almost 140 defendants. Let them out of the jail. Said we'll prosecute you later. And these were people charged with felony crimes. So, we all have something at stake when it breaks down like that. It's a dangerous precedent, as you said."
74806,70,"NEAL CONAN, host","And even in the, again, the elite Chicago system and this elite squad in the elite Chicago system, Marijane Placek, when she was defending Aloysius in this very high profile case, she had what, probably 25 other cases she was handling at the same time?"
74806,71,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","They juggle about 25 murder cases at a time. And you know, for, in potential capital murder cases, that's a lot. I mean - I would guess that a private criminal defense attorney doesn't handle a caseload anywhere near that. The public defenders do not have the same kinds of resources that the prosecutors have, which is investigators and experts and the entire police department behind them."
74806,72,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","So they are strained. And they don't have the budget to hire as many experts or forensics experts. So they're still, it's not an even playing field all the time. However, though, I would add that in Cook County here, the murder taskforce, I think, is unique in the country. And these are really highly skilled, experienced lawyers, because murder cases, of course here in Illinois, the death penalty still exists. The stakes are too high to allow a client to have an inadequate defense."
74806,73,"NEAL CONAN, host",Let's see if we can another listener on the line. And this is Mike(ph). Mike's calling us from Chicago.
74806,74,MIKE (Caller),Howdy.
74806,75,"NEAL CONAN, host",Hi.
74806,76,MIKE (Caller),How are you guys doing?
74806,77,"NEAL CONAN, host",Okay.
74806,140,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yeah, it's interesting."
74806,79,MIKE (Caller),"You know, I was calling because, you know, the stereotypes that run with the people who choose public defenders is often incorrect. I'm a president of a company here in Chicago. And I'm helping out this kid who's been - he had a really rough life, you know. Been in gangs as child, abandoned by his father, and recently was, you know, pulled over by Chicago cops and trumped up - charges were placed against him."
74806,80,MIKE (Caller),"And now, he's fighting because he doesn't have the money to hire his own attorney. He's there fighting and the perception is he's guilty when in essence, the police officers who arrested him were not the ones that testified in court to say that they witnessed what he did. And it's kind of bad because that was his word, you know, ex-gang member, had some charges as a youth."
74806,81,MIKE (Caller),"I've been working with him trying to get him to turn around his life. But yet, because he had public defender, because it's his word against the police officers, you know, we really don't feel that he's going to get a fair shake in court because of the perception everyone has of him."
74806,82,"NEAL CONAN, host","And that's a running theme throughout your book, Kevin Davis, of public defenders saying we're going to get the judge to believe our client as opposed to police officers, please."
74806,83,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",Right.
74806,84,"NEAL CONAN, host","Go ahead, Kevin."
74806,85,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","You know, they face that all the time. Public defenders are perceived as bureaucrats, as hacks, there to keep the system moving. You know, public defenders aren't apologists for criminals and they don't condone crime. They're there to serve, you know, a vital function. And I do believe that they do challenge the police and do so effectively. And they can. I've seen ferocious cross-examinations of Chicago police detectives that have revealed truths that otherwise would not have come out."
74806,86,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yet, we've also heard stories - and not necessarily in Chicago and certainly not in this particular squad - of public defenders found dozing at the defense table and various other, you know, declining to defend their clients vigorously, shall we say."
74806,87,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",There have certainly been cases like that.
74806,88,"NEAL CONAN, host",Yeah.
74806,89,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","And certainly - and they're not representative of a profession anymore than you or I are representative of journalism at large. Yes, there are problems. There are cops who lie. There are - but there are many more cops who are good cops. There are detectives who take shortcuts, but there are probably more detectives who do their job the right way. I think everybody goes into this with, with good intentions and tries to do the right thing."
74806,90,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, Mike, we…"
74806,91,MIKE (Caller),I'm sorry?
74806,92,"NEAL CONAN, host",Go ahead. I was just going to say we wish your friend the best of luck.
74806,93,MIKE (Caller),"Yeah. You know, and I - you know what, having gone to every one of his court cases and seeing them, those - the PD's and their role, I have the utmost respect for them because they are, they're working very hard and they have a lot of caseloads, a lot of cases and working hard for the people they represent. I admire them greatly. I think that they're underpaid."
74806,94,"NEAL CONAN, host","All right, Mike. Thanks very much."
74806,95,MIKE (Caller),Thank you.
74806,96,"NEAL CONAN, host","So long. Let's turn now to Leslie(ph). Leslie is with us from Charlotte, North Carolina."
74806,97,LESLIE (Caller),Yes. Hello.
74806,98,"NEAL CONAN, host",Hi.
74806,99,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",Hi.
74806,100,LESLIE (Caller),"This is something that I don't understand about law enforcement. Be it police, the DA, the FBI. They have to understand that they are equally on trial along with the suspect. That their tactics has to be thoroughly investigated, you know, as well as the tactics of the suspect. And that's necessary, you know, for the fundamental decency of this country."
74806,101,LESLIE (Caller),"I'm a paralegal. I have, you know, dealt with a few police officers that are resentful of this. And I tried to explain to them that, you know, you absolutely have to do this if you have a constitution. And they don't seem to realize, they're not taught that in school or, you know, in training, I should I say. And why this isn't made more clear, I don't understand."
74806,102,"NEAL CONAN, host","Well, Kevin Davis, was it your perception that cops did get training in that or that this sense of, hey, we're the good guys, overwhelms them?"
74806,103,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Well, sure. Overall, that's the perception. And I think the caller's insight is right on the money. You know, both sides are representing the law. And people do tend to forget that. A public defender serves a role just as important as the prosecutor."
74806,104,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Now, I interviewed one of officer Eric Lee's partners who survived the shooting. And I was ready for him to tell me, I don't know, how awful these public defenders are and everything. But he understood her role, Marijane's role. He didn't agree with it. He didn't like her. He found her brusque. He didn't like seeing her defending the man accused of killing his partner. But he understood it. And I just had lunch with another police officer recently. He told me the very same thing."
74806,105,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","He said, yeah, you know, we don't like them, but we get it. You know? So I think those who do work in the system understand it. And I think outsiders have a harder time understanding that. You know, when a public defender goes into court, they really are representing all of us. They serve this watchdog function. They are there to make sure that the prosecutor proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt."
74806,106,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","They're there to make sure that police don't take confessions from people inappropriately, that their searches and seizures are done by the book. These are the little things that people don't see that happen in court everyday. And actually, they're…"
74806,141,TONY (Caller),Instead one of you public fakers(ph).
79679,10,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)",Thank you.
74806,107,"NEAL CONAN, host","And they're doing it at the very cutting edge. This is - these are, if mistakes are being made, if injustices are being committed, they're being done against the poor, by definition - the people who can't afford their own lawyer, and that's where it matters most."
74806,108,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")",Absolutely.
74806,109,LESLIE (Caller),Right.
74806,110,"NEAL CONAN, host","Yeah. Leslie, thanks very much for the call."
74806,111,LESLIE (Caller),Certainly. Bye.
74806,112,"NEAL CONAN, host",Bye-bye. Let's see of we can go now to Victoria(ph). Victoria is with us from Sebastopol in California.
74806,113,VICTORIA (Caller),Hello.
74806,114,"NEAL CONAN, host","Hi, Victoria. You're on the air."
74806,115,VICTORIA (Caller),Hi. I have a few thoughts. I was getting kind of burned out listening to this.
74806,116,"NEAL CONAN, host",Sure.
74806,117,VICTORIA (Caller),"I think it's fantastic and critical that we even still have the defender's office since people are, I think, often charged wrongfully as we're finding out from the DNA tests, et cetera. And so, in a way, I think, the resources for the poor are still, you know, woefully inadequate. But, I'm horrified by the phone calls you're getting and even by some of the opinions echoed by the speaker, the author…"
74806,118,"NEAL CONAN, host",Mm-hmm.
74806,119,VICTORIA (Caller),"Where he says things like, oh, the person's not a monster, he's, you know, he could feel his veins, he could hear his - he could feel his breath, you know, as the guy was being sentenced. And I feel like listen, the person is a monster. You weren't there, you weren't the person who received the abuse. You aren't the person who slowly lost her breath as she was sitting in that, lying in the trunk of that car. You're not family member who has to shut your eyes every night to the horror of what was done to a family member."
74806,120,VICTORIA (Caller),"So, I really feel like, that people who are not victims, or not related to victims, have no right to sort of talk about how human the person who committed the crime, and only if it is indeed the person who omitted the crime, they have no right to talk about, oh, they shouldn't, their whole life shouldn't be judged by that. I beg your pardon. The whole life of the victim was determined and crippled by whoever perpetrated that terrible crime. And, you know, they have to pay, you know."
74806,121,"NEAL CONAN, host",Should they pay with their life?
74806,122,VICTORIA (Caller),"At times. But that's where the criminal justice system comes in, that's (unintelligible)…"
74806,123,"NEAL CONAN, host","And if it were you being charged, wouldn't you want somebody saying, she's more than just what she did in that 20 minutes, those horrible 20 minutes where she made a terrible mistake?"
74806,124,VICTORIA (Caller),"The pain and grief and suffering will be endless for the victim, endless for their family and endless for anybody who went through that. Why shouldn't they, I mean, I don't believe in capital punishment anymore, because I've unfortunately (unintelligible) how corrupt the courts and the police are. So, in that regard, the idea that you have all these innocent people were discovering who were sentenced to death…"
74806,125,"NEAL CONAN, host",Right.
74806,126,VICTORIA (Caller),"…for that reason, I no longer believe in capital punishment. But if the courts were fair and the police were not corrupt, then I would believe in capital punishment. Yes. I wanted this to say something very strongly and I say this as a person who used to be a middleclass journalist and is now a disabled poor woman and I've seen how two-sided people can be, and how evil people can be and what abuse they can do. What I want to say is that, you know, the only people who really knew what Ted Bundy was like were his victims, do you know?"
74806,127,VICTORIA (Caller),"So when you talk about the DA having feelings for the defendant and, you know, only if the defendant really was - the defendant really were the person, I'm saying to you, look, you weren't there, you didn't see the other face of that person when he was committing that horrible crime."
74806,128,"NEAL CONAN, host","Victoria, thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it."
74806,129,VICTORIA (Caller),Thank you.
74806,130,"NEAL CONAN, host","We're talking with Kevin Davis about ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defender's Office."" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."
74806,131,"NEAL CONAN, host","And getting back to Victoria's point, Kevin, you did talk with the wife of the officer who was killed, Shawn Lee, about - and there were any number of appeals and various twists to this case that brought her back into the courtroom various times. And the agony that she went through and you're talking about how even the cops who didn't like it, his partner, who didn't like it understood it, I'm not sure she understood it."
74806,132,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","No, she didn't. And this is a woman who was profoundly hurt. She has a daughter with her late husband and I watched her in court everyday, because I was there during the trial. And there were times where she had to get up and walk out. I saw a sadness in her eyes that I haven't seen in a lot of people."
74806,133,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","To her, Aloysius Oliver, the man accused of killing her husband was a monster. And she wanted to see justice done. And we spoke later about this and Shawn told me that she had really been opposed to the death penalty for most of her life. And until this moment, when her husband's life was taken away, she felt that she could support capital punishment. And she wasn't very proud of that. She really struggled, I think, with that idea and didn't feel good about this change in her opinion about capital punishment."
74806,134,"NEAL CONAN, host",Let's see if we can get Tony(ph) on the line. Tony is calling us from Connecticut.
74806,135,TONY (Caller),Good afternoon.
74806,136,"NEAL CONAN, host",Afternoon.
74806,137,TONY (Caller),"I've got to tell you, I have worked both sides of the defense table, both as private counsel and as a special public defender in Connecticut. I had a case, you know, a couple of times, to have a client who would a had at one point, the money to hire private counsel, and later was appointed to me as a special public defender. The attitude from your clients is often a direct result of exactly how much you cost them."
74806,138,"NEAL CONAN, host",Ha.
74806,139,TONY (Caller),"Because you do the exact same quality of work to the best of your ability, put the same quality of effort into defending the individual, and public defenders quite often hear, boy, next time I get pinched, I hope got enough money to hire me a real lawyer."
74806,143,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","Absolutely. And it's a thankless job. And I think that's what fascinated me so much about these public defenders is how thankless that job can be sometimes. Oftentimes, there are cases in which a client has hired a private attorney and has spent all their money and the case gets kicked over to the public defender's office. So, that can be the case."
74806,144,"NEAL CONAN, host","And the vigor in which somebody like Marijane Placek, who you write about so much, that she can rebound from disappointment after disappointment and savor the few victories she has and move on, and giving so much to every client, it's remarkable."
74806,145,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","They do savor it. Just back to the point about the public defenders, one of them joked, you know, that if you're unlucky enough to be arrested for murder in Chicago, you better hope that you're poor, because you're going to get excellent representation from the murder task force. Marijane and her colleagues, over in the murder task force, they do rebound everyday. They go in there. I was really impressed with how vigorous they do fight for these clients. And these are clients, many of them who are very unlikable, many of them who are guilty of the crimes for which they are charged."
74806,146,"Mr. KEVIN DAVIS (Author, ""Defending the Damned: Inside Chicago's Cook County Public Defenders Office"")","In the task force, their main job is to do one thing first, and that's in a capital, potential capital case, that's to save their client's life. That's a victory, that's a win in one sense. If you get a client 60 years instead of the death penalty, you've won something and you've won something big."

Another New Yorker, Hillary Clinton, spoofs ""The Sopranos"" and announced her new campaign theme song. And President Bush follows through on another promised veto.

77863,1,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","If this latest Republican health care bill fails, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he would work with Democrats on a health care bill. One Democrat who says he is willing to do that is Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, and he's with us now. Welcome to the show."
77863,2,TOM CARPER,"Kelly, it's great to be on. Thanks so much."
77863,3,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","So when you look at the United States of America right now and the health care that is available to people, particularly under the Affordable Care Act and the health care exchanges, do you see something that is working, or do you see something needs to be fixed?"
77863,4,TOM CARPER,"This is a work in progress. And if you go back seven, eight years ago when we took up the Affordable Care Act, at that time, we were spending 18 percent of GDP for health care in this country. We - the Japanese were spending eight percent. They were getting better results. And at night in this country then, we have 40 million people going to bed in 2009 without any coverage. And in Japan, they cover everybody."
77863,5,TOM CARPER,So they can't be that smart in Japan. We can't be that dumb. And so we tried to do something about it. And we'd have ended up I think with an even better plan if Republicans had felt comfortable in fully engaging with us. And they did not.
77863,6,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST",Do you think it's working right now?
77863,7,TOM CARPER,"I think parts of it are. All the focus is on the exchange. And the reason why the exchanges which cover about five, six, seven percent of the people - the reason why the prices have gone up there is because of the uncertainty fostered in no small part by the current administration."
77863,8,TOM CARPER,"The first thing we should do I think is hit the pause button to stabilize the exchanges. That would be a great first step - and then after that, as Democrats and Republicans working together, do three things. One, fix the things in the Affordable Care Act that need to be fixed. Two, retain the stuff that ought to be retained. And three are some things that ought to be dropped. Let's drop them. But we ought to do it not as Democrats, not as Republicans. This is something we ought to do together."
77863,9,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","What do you think about the bill that was put forward by your Republican colleagues today? Is there anything that you like in it, anything you think is constructive?"
77863,10,TOM CARPER,"Well, they've just introduced it. I'll be honest with you. I've not seen it. But I would say the first thing we ought to do is stabilize the exchanges. And then let's - people who have good ideas - let's bring them forward. Let's have hearings. Let's have all kinds of input and do it in the open."
77863,11,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","You know, as a Democrat, you are definitely on the sidelines of this debate right now. How likely is it, do you think, that this will become a bipartisan effort and that, you know, Democrats will have a voice in this conversation?"
77863,12,TOM CARPER,"Yeah. I think the voices that we've heard around the country, in Delaware and I think in probably 49 other states - where people have said, look; we need to provide coverage for people. We need to try to find a way to do it that's fiscally responsible. And there's a Kaiser-Permanente poll out I think earlier this week, and it said over 70 percent of the people polled want us to work together. And if the folks who feel that way continue to talk to the senators, continue to talk to the U.S. representatives, I think we'll hit the pause button. And I think they will fix and stabilize the exchanges. And then we'll turn to those other three options that I offered. One, fix what needs to be fixed in the ACA. You know, retain that which needs to be retained. And the provisions that can be dropped, drop them. I think most people say, well, that's just common sense. I think that's what we should do."
77863,13,"KELLY MCEVERS, HOST","Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, thank you so much."
77863,14,TOM CARPER,"Thanks so much, Kelly. Take care."

79679,12,Mr. JOHN HORRIGAN (Pew Internet & American Life Project),Nice to be with you.
79679,13,"IRA FLATOW, host","Thank you. Larry Peterson is professor and chair of the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. He's the director of the PlanetLab Consortium, an experiment into new networking technologies. He joins us from the studios on the Princeton campus. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY."
79679,14,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),Good afternoon.
79679,15,"IRA FLATOW, host","Let me ask you all, gentlemen. Let me ask you first, Larry. Ten years from now, what will the Internet look like? Take open that crystal ball for us. Can you look into it and tell us what you think the Internet will look like, what it should look like?"
79679,16,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"Well, what I hope it looks like is it's a place that you can securely do all sorts of online transactions. I think that's something that people are really worried about today, between the various fishing and hijacking of connections and so on, that we may, in fact, be reaching a point that the average user loses trust in the Internet, and that's clearly something we have to pay attention to over the next 10 years."
79679,17,"IRA FLATOW, host","Mm hmm. I know Phil Zimmermann, who's one of the gurus of security on the Internet, has been talking about the hijacking of voice material, people talking to each other now. That could be a problem."
79679,18,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),Absolutely.
79679,19,"IRA FLATOW, host",Yeah.
79679,20,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"This is a widespread problem. It's not just from the obvious, that you're not securely logging into your bank, but online content is under attack all the time from denial-of-service attacks and so on, so it's clearly an issue that we have to start paying attention to."
79679,21,"IRA FLATOW, host","Mm hmm. Tim Wu, what do you think the Internet could and should look like 10 years from now?"
79679,22,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","Well, it could look one of many ways. I think there's a basic debate that you mentioned earlier between something that's a much more centralized network than we have today, something more like cable television. And another vision, one which I think is better, which is rather like the Internet is today, just faster and capable of more things."
79679,23,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","The Internet today is very decentralized. People come up with stuff, whether it's on YouTube or whether it's eBay or whether it's, you know, people's blogs, and I hope that it retains its character as a decentralized medium that basically everyone uses, that just has a lot more bandwidth, is a lot faster, and works a lot better."
79679,24,"IRA FLATOW, host",Do we have to build a new backbone to the Internet?
79679,25,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","Do we have to build a new backbone? You know, I mean, the new - actually backbone, if you're interested in the technical side, backbone isn't where the problem is. There's a huge amount of capacity. Back in the 1990s, companies, even like Enron, built massive amounts of capacity into the backbone."
79679,26,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","The real bottleneck, and this has been true since 1990, since actually about 1913, is the pipes and the wire that goes to people's homes, and the challenge over the next decade is whether we will really get the same kind of speeds on the backbone in the last mile, which is to say right to people's homes."
79679,27,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","Right now, we have the same networks, the cable and the telephone networks, that we've had since the 1960s. You know, they've been updated a bit, but basically it's the same old stuff, and that's the big question over the next 10 years."
79679,28,Mr. JOHN HORRIGAN (Pew Internet & American Life Project),"And I would add that there are great incentives to upgrade the network simple because that's what users want. When we look at our surveys at the Pew Internet Project, most people who are signing onto broadband - and now today 42 percent of Americans have high-speed connections at home - sign on for the speed. They don't tell us that the price fell and I decided to switch. The longer people stay online, the more they want to do online, and their demand for speed increases as they get more experience on the Internet."
79679,29,"IRA FLATOW, host","Are they gonna forget about speed after a while and want the services more? I mean, will speed just become part of the product, for example, want the ability to watch television or stream video or do these kinds of high bandwidth things that they don't normally do now and that they're seeing other people doing, and, you know, they're, we're beginning to download old TV shows that we missed the night before on the Internet. So is that kind of thing they're gonna worry more about than the speed?"
79679,30,Mr. JOHN HORRIGAN (Pew Internet & American Life Project),"Well, I think they're gonna worry about both. People like to do those entertainment applications online, but one of the real markers of Internet user behavior, and it's a fairly common behavior along, across broadband Internet users, is what we call user-generated content. People like the speed in order to post things online about their lives, about what they're doing. They like to post online their own creativity."
79679,31,Mr. JOHN HORRIGAN (Pew Internet & American Life Project),"Now, some of that stuff is not gonna be widely interesting to the world at large, but it's interesting to users and their social networks. So they're gonna want the entertainment services, but they're gonna want to continue to have an Internet that enables them to express themselves online."
79679,32,"IRA FLATOW, host",Mm hmm.
79679,33,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)",Right. If I could add to that. I mean...
79679,34,"IRA FLATOW, host",Sure.
79679,35,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","...I think there's no doubt that people, you know, people would like more bandwidth but - and people would like more services, people like watching videos. They move, and you can see people walking around. But the question is who provides them?"
79679,61,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","I'll jump in on that. I don't quite see it as a threat as much as a phenomenon. Particularly at the country level. It's not that countries won't be able to talk to each other, it's just that they will talk to each other less. You know, when the Internet was much smaller a decade ago, there were only so many people on it and so everybody always talked to each other."
91776,3,ANGUS DEATON,GDP and mortality and education are the sort of basic statistics for how the nation's doing.
79679,36,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","And there's a basic philosophical divide between two approaches, one which is more like cable, which is basically what we've had since the '70s, which is a centralized entity like the phone company or the cable company and some producers create it, or what was just referred to, the kind of world where people just throw up random things and that's what people watch. And how you build the network, how the network gets built out will determine what kind of culture prevails. Something more like what the Internet's now, which is much more of a folky kind of culture where people watch really bad quality video 'cause they think it's funny or they read blogs almost as much as they'll read the New York Times. Or something which is more like the old media world where things like video are dominated by centralized decision makers. That's the philosophical battle behind net neutrality and a lot of other stuff going on right now."
79679,37,"IRA FLATOW, host",Larry Peterson.
79679,38,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"I'd just like to add that of course speed is always going to be an issue and users are certainly going to demand more services from the network. But there are going to be issues of ease of use, of trust, of I'm going to want to take the Internet with me wherever I go, that I'm always connected, I always access to my data and so on."
79679,39,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"These, of course, are services. But, again, I get back to the issue of trust and that's going to become a very significant aspect of the consumer's view of the Internet."
79679,40,"IRA FLATOW, host",Go ahead.
79679,41,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","Sorry, can I step in?"
79679,42,"IRA FLATOW, host",Sure.
79679,43,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","I don't completely disagree with that, but I want to disagree a little bit. People have been saying since the '90s that so many things wouldn't happen on the Internet because no one trusts the Internet. Pierre Omidyar, who founded eBay, his whole founding principle was that, you know, people trust each other. And eBay has never been all that secure, but it's managed to be successful nonetheless."
79679,44,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","And it is sort of surprising how many things, you know, how secure the blogs need to be, how much do you have to trust them? I think there's been a bit of surprise over the last decade of how many things have happened on the Internet, even though it's not as secure as some people might like. I think that's been a bit of surprise to people."
79679,45,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),I think a lot agree with that.
79679,46,"Professor TIM WU (Author, Who Controls the Internet?)","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
79679,47,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"So it's certainly the case that the Internet has just grown beyond expectations and people are depending on it despite all the security risks that are there. But on the other hand, what I see happening is what I would call the Internet fragmenting into gated communities."
79679,48,Professor LARRY PETERSON (Princeton University),"And this is almost like the neutrality aspect of the issue, that there are places you just can't get to and the universal connectivity of the original Internet is deteriorating. Because of a lack of security built into the Internet your only recourse is to throw up all sorts of protections that are extremely suspicious of every bit of traffic that happens to fly by."
