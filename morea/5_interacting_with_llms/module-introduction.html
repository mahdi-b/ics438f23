<p>In this module, we delve into the programmatic interaction with Large Language Models for data structuring prior to analytics. Recognizing that LLMs have revolutionized the conversion of unstructured data—like text, medical records, receipts, or invoices—into structured forms for analytics, we’ll discuss useful methods and toos to leverage this poweful tools. You’ll see that the complexities that once hindered these tasks have been vastly simplified by LLMs. We’ll cover best practices and strategies to ensure the conversions are representative and leverage the power while avoiding common pitfalls of these models.</p>
