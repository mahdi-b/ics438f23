### Evaluating Classification
<br/>


Evaluating classification results is crucial when using LLMs, as these models transform unstructured text into structured data by classifying tokens or words into specific classes (e.g., categorizing 'Amazon' as an 'Organization Name'). Understanding the performance of an LLM ensures accuracy in this transformation, making it imperative to assess its effectiveness comprehensively.

You can access the notebook [here](resources/Evaluating_classification.ipynb).
