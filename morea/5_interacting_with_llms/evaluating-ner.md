### Evaluating Classification
<br/>

Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a pivotal role in converting text into structured data. By identifying and classifying specific entities within a text (like 'The University of Hawaii' as an 'Academic Institution'), NER lays the foundation for advanced analytics. NER is a specialized form of classification, and as such, its evaluation methods differ uniquely from standard classification approaches. Grasping its significance ensures that we can effectively harness the power of text data, turning raw information into actionable insights.
