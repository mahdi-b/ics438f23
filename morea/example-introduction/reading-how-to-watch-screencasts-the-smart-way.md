# How to watch screencasts the smart way

A very significant essay in hacker culture is “[How to ask questions the smart
way](https://wiki.c2.com/?HowToAskQuestionsTheSmartWay)“, which provides
important tips on how to utilize the online community efficiently and
effectively. This page provides tips on how to watch screencasts the smart
way. This issue is important, because this class uses a “flipped” pedagogy, in
which lectures are not provided face-to-face but rather online through YouTube
videos. 

Two primary benefits of the “flipped” approach are:

  * Precious class time can be spent on group work activities where face-to-face interaction is most valuable.
  * Screencasts can be viewed by students at the times and places of their choosing. Sections of screencasts can be re-viewed as many times as each student desires.

After several years using this approach, student reaction is generally
positive. At the same time, this new format does create certain challenges
for efficient and effective learning. Here are some heuristics we’ve
discovered for addressing these challenges.

## (1) Don’t multi-task

Since you can watch the screencasts at a time and place of your own choosing,
it is tempting to watch them while also doing other activities: watching TV,
texting, talking to friends, playing online games, reading FaceBook. However,
your goal is not to simply have *watched* the material, but to have
actually *learned* the material, and  there is mounting scientific evidence showing
that multi-tasking impairs learning
ability.

For these reasons, it is in your best
interest to block all other activities while watching the screencast. Since
most screencasts are less than 20 minutes long, this should not be a huge imposition.

## (2) Take notes

In a traditional classroom, the lecture is ephemeral and thus written notes
provides a necessary means to capture the information. (Other mechanisms
include recording the lecture on your phone, or even videotaping the lecture
with your phone.) 

When the lecture is already recorded and available at any
time as a screencast, it might seem reasonable to not take notes because the
material is always accessible online. 

However, to maximize the efficiency
with which you learn the material, you should take notes on the screencast,
because [note taking stabilizes information for retrieval at a later
date](https://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol16/boch.pdf). 

Put another way, your
ultimate goal is to not have to re-watch the lecture every time you need the
information, and note-taking helps you achieve that goal more quickly and
efficiently. 

Since you are not multi-tasking (see heuristic (1)), you will have the time and
space necessary to take notes on the lecture. 

Finally, by recording the
elapsed time into the lecture associated with the material represented in the
note, you can use your notes to later rewatch portions of the material quickly
and efficiently as needed. You can also use your notes to record
questions you have about the material for later discussion, as presented next.

## (3) Use the mailing list to ask questions and discuss the material

One of the most significant pedagogical drawbacks associated with the
“flipped” classroom is the inability of the instructor and students to engage
in real-time, interactive conversation about the material as it is introduced,
and the inability of the instructor to modify the presentation in real-time to
adapt to student reaction. 

Screencasts can further inhibit conversation about
the material if students conclude that their questions could be resolved
simply by re-watching the screencast at some future date. 

To learn most
efficiently, you should record questions you have as you watch the screencast,
then post those questions to the discussion group.

## (4) Watch in full screen, high definition

Many of the screencasts involve demonstrations of user interface tools or
other technologies.  You should watch those lectures in full screen mode in
the highest resolution possible (typically 1080). That way, you will clearly
see all user interface elements and be able to understand the procedures most
easily. 

Watching in full screen mode also prevents you from seeing other
windows, thus helping to minimize multi-tasking. For example, here are two
images taken from the same screencast, one viewed at 720p and one at 1080p.
Click on each image to display it full size, and notice how much sharper the
1080p screencast is: 

### 1080p

<a href="https://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-1080.png"><img class="wp-image-243  " alt="screencast-1080" src="https://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-1080.png?w=300" width="300" height="178" />

### 720p

<a href="https://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-720.png"><img class="wp-image-244  " alt="720p" src="https://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-720.png?w=300" width="300" height="188" /></a>


I have noticed that, at least with the Chrome
browser, sometimes you can select 1080p in YouTube and the screencast is still
displayed in a lower resolution. In Firefox, selecting the 1080p resolution
results in the video quality "gear" icon rotating until 1080p resolution is
ready for viewing. So, if you have problems with Chrome, you might try
Firefox.
