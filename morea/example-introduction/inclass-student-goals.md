# In Class: What are your goals?

Break up into small groups and meet in one of the #class-breakout channels assigned to you by the instructor.  Elect one person to be the scribe and take notes. Use a shared google doc or something similar so that everyone can see the notes as they are being written.

Decide on your team name (very important!)

Answer the following questions:

  1. What does your group consider to be the 3-6 most important goals for ICS 314?

  2. What learning strategies will be effective in achieving these goals?

  3. What risk factors might prevent you from achieving these goals?

After approximately 10 minutes, we will gather together and a spokesperson from each group will present the results of their work.

**Please enable your video camera while you are in your breakout room!  It makes the experience much better for everyone and can even raise the quality of your work.**
