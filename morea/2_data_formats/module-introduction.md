This module explores essential aspects of data storage in big data
analytics. It includes pivotal considerations such as the distinction
between column and row storage, along with data splitability. The
module explores file formats and techniques such as efficient
streaming and memory mapping. We'll learn how Apache Arrow, a modern
framework, allows you to efficinetly analyze big datasets that don't
fit in your computer's memory. Once you finish this module, you'll
know when and how to use various formats and manage large datasets
effectively.
