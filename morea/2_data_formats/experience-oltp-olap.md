The [following blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/combine-transactional-and-analytical-data-using-amazon-aurora-and-amazon-redshift/) describes how Amazon Aurora, a transactional processing platform, 
can be routed for analysis to Redshift, an analytics platform.

Several services are covered in the proposed architecture, including Lambda functions, Kinesis data streaming services,  and S3 buckets.

It is not necessary to apply the tutorial; all you need to do is read and understand the infrastructure.
