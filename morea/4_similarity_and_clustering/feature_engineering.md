### Feature Engineering in Text Documents
<br/>

This module delves into feature engineering for text documents. Feature engineering is key for transforming raw text into structured, machine-understandable data; a necessary task in analytics. Topics covered include term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), learned context-specific and context-agnostic settings.


The relevant Jupyter Notebook can be obtained [here](resources/feature_engineering.ipynb).
